 <p>"<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">And</span> a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became into four heads."</p>  
 <p>In chapter second of Part Second we presented the simple and natural interpretation suggested by the hypothesis of a primitive circumpolar continent. If the reader will kindly turn back to the statement there made (<a href="pf08.htm#page_51">p. 51</a>), he will see in how natural a manner the water system of that lost "land of delights" might have become, in after tradition, the one disparted river which waters the whole earth.</p>  
 <p>The insuperable difficulties of all hitherto attempted identifications of the four rivers are too numerous to present here in detail. <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">1</font></a> In our interpretation</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>the original river is from the sky; the division takes place on the heights at the Pole, and the four resulting rivers are the chief streams of the circumpolar continent as they descend in different directions to the surrounding sea. Does such a view find any support in the traditions of the ancient world?</p>  
 <p>That it does will be clear to any one who has carefully read thus far. Let us take the rivers of the Persian cradle of the race. Where do they rise? If the investigator of this question have made no previous studies in Comparative Sacred Hydrography, he will be surprised to find that in Persian thought, not only the Paradise rivers, but also all the rivers of the whole earth, <i>have but one headspring and but one place of discharge</i>.</p>  
 <p>This head-spring is the Ardvî-Sûra, situated in heaven,the heaven of the Pole. "This heavenly fountain," says Haug, summarizing the contents of the Abân Yasht,"this heavenly fountain has a thousand springs and a thousand canals, each of them forty days journey long. Thence a channel goes through all the seven <i>keshvares</i>, or regions of the earth, conveying everywhere pure celestial waters." <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>The following is an ancient invocation to Anâhita, the spirit of these heavenly waters: "Come before me, Ardvî-Sûra Anâhita!come down from yonder stars on to the earth created by Ahura-Mazda! Thee shall worship the handy lords, the rulers of countries, sons of the rulers of countries." <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>From its elevation the heavenly height is called Hûgar, <i>i.e.</i>, "the lofty:" "Hûgar, the lofty, is the mount from which the water of Ardvî-Sûra leaps down the height of a thousand men." <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">2</font></a> Again it is written, "Hagar, the lofty, on which the water of Ardvî-Sûra flows and leaps, is the chief of summits, since it is that above which is the revolution of Satavês, the chief of reservoirs." <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>As all the rivers of the earth's seven regions, so all lakes and seas and the ocean itself, are from this one celestial fountain. "Through the warmth and clearness of the water, purifying more than other</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a></p>  
 <p>waters, everything continually flows from the source Ardvî-Sara." <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">1</font></a> However named, all waters are simply portions of the same heaven-descending stream. "The other innumerable waters and rivers, springs and channels, are one in origin with those, so in various districts and various places they call them by various names." <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">2</font></a> Even plant-sap, and blood, and milk, and all the seventeen kinds of liquid enumerated in the Yashts, are parts of the one cosmic current. "All these, through growth, or the body which is formed, mingle again with the rivers, for the body which is formed and the growth are both one." <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Everything of a liquid nature, therefore, in the whole world is conceived of as proceeding from one source high in the north-polar sky. Whither is it tending? What becomes of it all in the end? Where do its myriad rills and rivers at last discharge? As according to the cosmological conception so often illustrated in these pages, all start from the zenith, we should naturally expect all to reunite at last in the nadir. This is found to be the fact. But in this nether gathering place the waters, now polluted from their contact with all the filth and vileness of the world, are not allowed to rest and</p>

 <p>accumulate. <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">1</font></a> This cesspool of the universe has a <i>pervious</i> bottom. By the various processes of straining, vaporizing, aeration, etc., the polluted waters are by Tishtar brought back distilled and purified, and are re-discharged into the zenith-reservoir which perpetually supplies the gushing streams of Ardvî-Sûra. <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">2</font></a> Into such a marvelously complete cosmical circulatory water system did the Iranic imagination develop the primitive head-stream of Eden. But never, even in the most extravagant mythological adornments of the idea, was it for a moment forgotten that the original undivided stream originates in the north polar sky; and that its division into earthly streams and rivers is on the holy mount which stands in the centre of Kvanîras, the central and circumpolar <i>keshvare</i> of the whole habitable earth. <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>The various fragmentary allusions of the oldest Greek poets to Okeanos and the rivers would seem to imply the early existence, and perhaps early loss, of a similar Hellenic conception of the water circulation of the entire earth. Thus, according to Homer's familiar couplet, it is from Okeanos, in</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>some application of the term, that "all rivers and every sea and all fountains flow."  <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">1</font></a> Euripides presents the same idea. <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">2</font></a> There is, therefore, <i>one fountain</i> of all the world's waters. The same conception is expressed by Hesiod in his Theogony, where all rivers, as sons, and all fountains and brooks, as daughters, are traced back to Okeanos. Then we have a constant descending movement of all waters until they reach the world-surrounding Ocean-river at the equator, beyond which is the Underworld. From this equatorial ocean, parting off from the southern or under shore, new branches diverge and form the river system of the Hadean kingdom. Other Underworld rivers were perhaps conceived of as percolating through the earth and emerging to the surface in the lower hemisphere. There is at least some evidence that the Greeks, like the Persians, had this idea of interterranean water-courses, and even rivers, resembling the circulation of the blood in the human body. <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">3</font></a> Sometimes these Underworld rivers are represented as four in number, thus making the circumpolar water system of the Underworld a perfect counterpart of the Eden rivers at the summit of the upper hemisphere. <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">4</font></a> All, moreover, like those of the Persian Underworld, seem to be plunging forward and ever downward, until in the last glimpse which the imagination can catch they are seen streaming from the roof of the grot of the goddess Styx, and, as Preller expresses it,</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "falling thence, beneath the Earth, downward into the deep, deep Night." <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Here, then, we have a unitary water system, embracing the whole earth, and the remarkable Homeric and Hesiodic term ἀψόῤῥοος, "refluent," may well imply that the Underworld προχοὴ, or "outflow," <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>returns</i> in nature's perfect order to feed its original fountain, thus conforming the whole, in every part, to the sacred hydrography of the Persians. <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Granting this, one should locate the Okeanos-fountain, not where Preller and Welcker and Völcker and the other mythographers have hitherto placed it, but in the farthest North, and in the sky. That this location was the original one is plain from all the local implications of the mythological accounts of the proper home of Okeanos and Têthys, and is further confirmed by many incidental evidences connected with such myths as those of the Eridanus, <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">4</font></a> the Acheloös, the birth of Zeus, and particularly those of Atlas and his children. <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>In the most ancient Akkadian, Assyrian, and Babylonian literature there are expressions which seem clearly to indicate the presence among these peoples of a precisely similar conception with respect to the waters of the world. <a name="fr_408"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">1</font></a> The same is true of Egyptian literature, but in both these cases the data are as yet too meagre to make them entirely conclusive in argument. <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">2</font></a> We therefore pass them by, and close with a glance at the Eden river of the ancient Aryans of India.</p>  
 <p>This, as already seen, is the heaven-born Gangâ. The Vedas call it "the river of the three worlds," for the reason that it flows through Heaven and Earth and the Underworld. In Vedic times "the original source and home of the waters was thought to be the highest heaven (<i>paramam vyoman</i>), the region peculiarly sacred to Varuna." <a name="fr_410"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">3</font></a> This is clearly</p>

 <p>illustrated in scores of passages: for example, in the beautiful prayer for immortality, where the fourfold <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">1</font></a> head-spring of all waters is located in the sacred Centre of Heaven. <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">2</font></a> Sometimes the heaven-sprung stream is called the Sindhu, <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">3</font></a> sometimes the Sarasvatî. <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">4</font></a> In the later Mahâbhârata its head-spring is placed in the heaven of Vishnu, high above the lofty Pole-star (Druva). On their descent the ethereal waters wash the Pole-star, and the Seven Rishis (the Great Bear), and the polar pivot of "the lunar orb," <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">5</font></a> thence falling upon the top of beautiful</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Meru. "On the summit of Meru," says the Vishnu Purana, "is the vast city of Brahma, . . . inclosed by the river Gangâ, which, issuing from the foot of Vishnu and washing the lunar orb, falls here [on the top of Meru] from the skies, and, after encircling the city, <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">1</font></a> divides into four mighty rivers, flowing in opposite directions. These rivers are Sítá, the Alakanandá, the Chakshu, and the Bhadrá. The first, falling on the tops of the inferior mountains on the east side of Meru, flows over their crests, and passes through the country of Bhadráswa to the ocean. The Alakanandá flows south to the country of Bhárata, and, dividing into seven rivers on the way, falls into the sea. The Chakshu falls into the sea after traversing all the western mountains and passing through Ketumála. And the Bhadrá washes the country of the Uttarakurus and empties itself into the northern ocean." <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>Here, again, as our interpretation of Genesis requires, the four rivers traced back to their origin bring us to the summit of the earth at the Pole,to the one river which descends from the north polar sky. Curious confirmations of this primitive conception come even from the most distant continents. <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">1</font></a> Late Christian legend shows evident traces of it, for in Maundeville's description of the Paradise-fountain he says, "All the sweet waters of the world <i>above and beneath</i> take their beginning from that well of Paradise;" and again, "Out of that well all waters <i>come and go</i>,"giving thus clear expression to the idea of a unitary cosmic water </p>

 <p>circulation. <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">1</font></a> So, again, in the apocryphal "Revelation of the Holy Apostle Paul," the angel who was showing the apostle the wonders of the heavenly city brought him to just such a World-river, whose spring was in heaven, but whose main body surrounded the earth.</p>  
 <p>"And he set me upon the river whose source springs up in the circle of heaven, and it is this river which encircleth the whole earth. And he says unto me: This river is Ocean." <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

When West (<i>Pahlavi Texts</i>, Pt. i., p. 35, note 6) uses the last clause of this quotation to show that the location of Hûgar is "probably" in the western quarter, his argument rests upon two mistakes, both of which seem to be shared by all modern Avestan students. The first mistake is to suppose Satavês a different star from Tishtar (Ti<i>s</i>trya); and the second is the notion that Tishtar was the star now called Sirius. The fact is that originally Satavaêsa and Ti<i>s</i>trya were simply two designations for one and the same object, and that object was not our Sirius, but the Pole star. I say <i>our</i> Sirius, because there is evidence that this name also once belonged to a very different heavenly body, and to one situated in "<i>die Mitte des Himmels</i>," <i>i.e.</i>, at the Pole. (Ideler, <i>Sternennamen</i>, p. 216.)

In Indian cosmology the lunar sphere is concentric with and includes the earth-sphere; hence water falling perpendicularly from the celestial to the terrestrial pole can yet on its way "wash the lunar sphere." So too a mountain at the North Pole, if only high enough, will reach to the "lunar sphere." Such, in fact, was the case with the Paradise mountain of Indian cosmology, and traces of the idea live on in the Talmud <a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a> and in Patristic theology too plain for even Massey to render valueless: "Meru is shown to be the mount which reached to the moon and became a figure of the four lunar quarters. . . . Hence the tradition that Paradise was preserved during, or was exempt from, the Deluge because it was on the summit of a mountain that reached to the moon (Bereshith Rabba, xxxiii.); which shows the continuation of the typical mount of the seven stars into the lunar phase of timekeeping, where the mount of the four quarters carried Eden with it." <i>The Natural Genesis</i>, vol. ii., p. 244.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_416"></a><a href="pf29.htm#fr_416">259:1</a> Here is probably the origin of the curious notion of the Sabæans touching the Euphrates. Or was the borrowing on the other side?

It is 800 li in circuit. In the midst of this lake is the abode of a Naga, who is in fact the transformed appearance of Dasabhumi Bodhisatwa (or of the Bodhisatwas of the ten earths). From his abode proceed four refreshing rivers, which compass Jambu-dwîpa. At the east side of the lake, from the mouth of a silver ox, flows out the Ganges River. After compassing the lake once it enters the sea towards the southeast. From the south side of the lake, from the mouth of a golden elephant, flows the Sindhu [Indus] River. After compassing the lake once it enters the sea on the southwest. On the west side of the lake, flowing from the mouth of a horse of lapis-lazuli, flows the river Foh-tzu (Vakshu, <i>i.e.</i>, Oxus), which, after compassing the lake once, enters the sea on the northwest. On the north side of the lake, flowing from a crystal lion, flows the river Sida [Hoang-ho], which after making one circuit flows into the sea on the northeast."
