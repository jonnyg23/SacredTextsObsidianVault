 This is among the first and rarest of the Hollow Earth books.
 In the early 19th century, John Cleves Symmes proposed that
 the earth was actually a set of five nested spheres, each
 with polar openings.
 He unsuccessfully lobbied congress to fund an expedition to
 the poles to investigate this theory.
 This novel, based on Symmes' theories, was published in 1820.
 Some believe that Symmes was the author, but this has not been established
 beyond a shadow of doubt.

 <p>
 Probably the first US utopian science fiction novel,
 <cite>Symzonia</cite> is also a classic sea yarn.
 The narrator, Mr. Seaborn, initiates just such an expedition as
 Symmes dreamed of.
 With a special high-tech paddle boat, built with no metal to avoid
 magnetic effects, Seaborn sets out on a voyage into uncharted
 southern waters.
 Conflict is provided by a mutinous Mr. Slim, who proves
 to be Seaborn's nemesis.
 Eventually the ship penetrates into the Antarctic hole, and voyages
 deep into the inner surface of the earth, which Seaborn claims for the
 US and calls 'Symzonia'.
 They encounter  a utopian society, run by a benevolent aristocracy,
 which has long since banished all of their misfits to a distant colony,
 and possibly the outside Earth.
 The Symzonians have advanced airships, boats with jet propulsion,
 flame-proof cloth woven from spiderwebs, and a mysterious weapon
 of mass destruction.
 Eventually, they expel Seaborn and his crew back to the exterior world.
 Due to a series of accidents, all material evidence of Symzonia is lost
 on the return voyage, and Seaborn is swindled out of his profits.

 Edmond Halley, the famed astronomer, was the first to propose that
 the Earth contained a set of nested hollow spheres.
 Symme's theory, and this book in particular, was likely one of Poe's primary
 influences, particularly seen in his
 <cite>Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</cite>.
 The rumor of a hidden advanced civilization inside the earth has
 long been elaborated in fictional and occult books from
 <a href="../../atl/vril/index.htm">Bulwer-Lytton</a> to the 
 <a href="../../ufo/irl/index.htm">the Shaver Mystery</a>.

 PRODUCTION NOTES: Published in 1820 and only reprinted once in 1965,
 this book is almost impossible to obtain.
 I searched for years for a copy of this in vain.
 I was finally able to obtain a copy of the 1965 facsimile for over $250,
 and used that as the basis of this etext.--<small>J.B. Hare, December 8, 2008.</small>
