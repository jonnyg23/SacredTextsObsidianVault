 <p>Marshall B. Gardner, a hollow-earth proponent, published the first edition
 of this book in 1913, <i>after</i> Peary reached the North Pole in 1909.
 Gardner thus had a much harder job than
 <a href="../potp/index.htm">William Reed</a>; that is, overcoming the
 public perception that the poles had been reached.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gardner's book is in some ways superior to other books in this genre.
 He attempts to come up with a scientific hypothesis to explain the formation
 of hollow planets, instead of divine fiat or no explanation at all.
 He is also a lot more readable.
 One of the most enjoyable parts of this book is Gardner's fantasy account
 of a journey into the interior of the hollow earth, which, while not up
 to the standards of Jules Verne, seems almost plausible if you can suspend
 your disbelief temporarily.
 </p>
 <p>
 Naturally, a great deal of the book consists of narratives of arctic explorers
 (covering some of same material as Reed).
 The book marshals a great deal of anomalous polar evidence,
 such as attested warm regions near the poles, red dust, strange
 auroras and so on.
 Last but not least are those poor flash-frozen Siberian mammoths,
 who seem to crop up with such regularity in the crank literature,--probably
 because traditional scientific explanations of their demise always
 sound so fishy when quoted out of context.</p>
 <p>
 There is a long section at the end where he deals with the response
 to the first edition of his book, including an opponent who raises
 a theory of a prehistoric 90 degree polar shift
 to account for some of the same evidence!
 By contrast, a hollow earth would definitely be more plausible.
 </p>
 <p>
 Although Gardner doesn't attack the scientific method or basic physical
 laws, as other alternative earth theorists do, perhaps he <i>should</i> have.
 According to traditional physics, inside of a hollow earth-sized sphere
 there should be zero gravity; and centrifugal force caused
 by the earth's rotation would be insufficient to keep things
 inside the hollow earth from floating away, either.
 Working out the math of a star small enough to fit inside the earth,
 not too hot to fry the interior surface,
 and not too dense to turn into a black hole is 'left as an exercise.'
 The charming idea of denizens of the hollow earth going about their
 business lit by a never-setting mini-sun is simply a fantasy.
