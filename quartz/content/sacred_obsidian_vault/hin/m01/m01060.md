 <p>"Saunaka said, 'O son, thou hast narrated to me this extensive and great history commencing from the progeny of Bhrigu. O son of <i>Suta</i>, I have been much gratified with thee. I ask thee again, to recite to me, O son of a <i>Suta</i>, the history composed by Vyasa. The varied and wonderful narrations that were recited amongst those illustrious <i>Sadasyas</i> assembled at the sacrifice, in the intervals of their duties of that long-extending ceremony, and the objects also of those narrations, I desire to hear from thee, O son of a <i>Suta</i>! Recite therefore, all those to me fully.'</p>  
 <p>'Sauti said, 'The Brahmanas, in the intervals of the duties, spoke of many things founded upon the <i>Vedas</i>. But Vyasa recited the wonderful and great history called the <i>Bharata</i>.'</p>  
 <p>"Saunaka said, 'That sacred history called the <i>Mahabharata</i>, spreading the fame of the Pandavas, which Krishna-Dwaipayana, asked by Janamejaya, caused to be duly recited after the completion of the sacrifice. I desire to hear duly. That history hath been born of the ocean-like mind of the great <i>Rishi</i> of soul purified by <i>yoga</i>. Thou foremost of good men, recite it unto me, for, O son of a Suta, my thirst hath not been appeased by all thou hast said.'</p>  
 <p>'Sauti said, 'I shall recite to thee from the beginning of that great and</p>

 <p>excellent history called the <i>Mahabharata</i> composed by Vyasa. O Brahmana, listen to it in full, as I recite it. I myself feel a great pleasure in reciting it.'"</p>
