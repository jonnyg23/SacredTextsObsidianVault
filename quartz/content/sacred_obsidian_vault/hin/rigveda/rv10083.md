 <p>1. HE who hath reverenced thee, Manyu, destructive bolt, breeds for himself forthwith all conquering energy.<br> Ārya and Dāsa will we conquer with thine aid, with thee the Conqueror, with conquest conquest-sped.<br> 2 Manyu was Indra, yea, the God, was Manyu, Manyu was Hotar, Varuṇa, Jātavedas.<br> The tribes of human lineage worship Manyu. Accordant with thy fervour, Manyu, guard us.<br> 3 Come hither, Manyu, mightier tham the mighty; chase, with thy fervour for ally, our foemen.<br> Slayer of foes, of Vṛtra, and of Dasyu, bring thou to us all kinds of wealth and treasure.<br> 4 For thou art, Manyu, of surpassing vigour, fierce, queller of the foe, and self-existent,<br> Shared by all men, victorious, subduer: vouchsafe to us superior strengith in battles.<br> 5 I have departed, still without a portion, wise God! according to thy will, the Mighty.<br> I, feeble man, was wroth thee, O Manyu I am myself; come thou to give me vigour.<br> 6 Come hither. I am all thine own; advancing turn thou to me, Victorious, All-supporter!<br> Come to me, Manyu, Wielder of the Thunder: bethink thee of thy friend, and slay the Dasyus.<br> 7 Approach, and on my right hand hold thy station: so shall we slay a multitude of foemen.<br> The best of meath I offer to support thee: may we be first to drink thereof in quiet.</p>
