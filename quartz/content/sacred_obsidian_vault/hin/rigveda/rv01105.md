 <p>1. WITHIN the waters runs the Moon, he with the beauteous wings in heaven.<br> Ye lightnings with your golden wheels, men find not your abiding-place. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 2 Surely men crave and gain their wish. Close to her husband clings the wife.<br> And, in embraces intertwined, both give and take the bliss of love. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 3 O never may that light, ye Gods, fall from its station in the sky.<br> Neer fail us one like Soma sweet, the spring of our felicity. Mark this my woe<font size="-1" color="green">,</font> ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 4 I ask the last of sacrifice. As envoy he shall tell it forth.<br> Where is the ancient law divine? Who is its new diffuser now? Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 5 Ye Gods who yonder have your home in the three lucid realms of heaven,<br> What count ye truth and what untruth? Where is mine ancient call on you? Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 6 What is your firm support of Law? What Varuṇa's observant eye?<br> How may we pass the wicked on the path of mighty Aryaman? Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 7 I am the man who sang of old full many a laud when Soma flowed.<br> Yet torturing cares consume me as the wolf assails the thirsty deer. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 8 Like rival wives on every side enclosing ribs oppress me sore.<br> O Śatakratu, biting cares devour me, singer of thy praise, as rats devour the weaver's threads. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 9 Where those seven rays are shining, thence my home and family extend.<br> This Tṛta Āptya knoweth well, and speaketh out for brotherhood. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 10 May those five Bulls which stand on high full in the midst of mighty heaven,<br> Having together swiftly borne my praises to the Gods, return. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 11 High in the mid ascent of heaven those Birds of beauteous pinion sit.<br> Back from his path they drive the wolf as he would cross the restless floods. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 12 Firm is this new-wrought hymn of praise, and meet to be told forth, O Gods.<br> The flowing of the floods is Law, Truth is the Sun's extended light. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 13 Worthy of laud, O Agni, is that kinship which thou hast with Gods.<br> Here seat thee like a man: most wise, bring thou the Gods for sacrifice. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 14 Here seated, man-like as a priest shall wisest Agni to the Gods<br> Speed onward our oblations, God among the Gods, intelligent. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 15 Varuṇa makes the holy prayer. To him who finds the path we pray.<br> He in the heart reveals his thought. Let sacred worship rise anew. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 16 That pathway of the Sun in heaven, made to be highly glorified,<br> Is not to be transgressed, O Gods. O mortals, ye behold it not. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 17 Tṛta, when buried in the well, calls on the Gods to succour him.<br> That call of his Bṛhaspati heard and released him from distress. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 18 A ruddy wolf beheld me once, as I was faring on my path.<br> He, like a carpenter whose back is aching crouched and slunk away. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.<br> 19 Through this our song may we, allied with Indra, with all our heroes conquer in the battle.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
