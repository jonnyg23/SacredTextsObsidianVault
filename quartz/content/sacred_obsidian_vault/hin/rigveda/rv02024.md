 <p>1. BE pleased with this our offering, thou who art the Lord; we will adore thee with this new and mighty song.<br> As this thy friend, our liberal patron, praises thee, do thou, Bṛhaspati, fulfil our hearts' desire.<br> 2 He who with might bowed down the things that should be bowed, and in his fury rent the holds of Śambara:<br> Who overthrew what shook not, Brahmaṇaspati,he made his way within the mountain stored with wealth.<br> 3 That was a great deed for the Godliest of the Gods: strong things were loosened and the firmly fixed gave way.<br> He drave the kine forth and cleft Vala through by prayer, dispelled the darkness and displayed the light of heaven.<br> 4 The well with mouth of stone that poured a flood of meath, which Brahmaṇaspati hath opened with his might<br> All they who see the light have drunk their fill thereat: together they have made the watery fount flow forth.<br> 5 Ancient will be those creatures, whatsoeer they be; with moons, with autumns, doors unclose themselves to you.<br> Effortless they pass on to perfect this and that, appointed works which Brahmaṇaspati ordained.<br> 6 They who with much endeavour searching round obtained the Paṇis noblest treasure hidden in the cave,<br> Those sages, having marked the falsehoods, turned them back whence they had come, and sought again to enter in.<br> 7 The pious ones when they had seen the falsehoods turned them back, the sages stood again upon the lofty ways.<br> Cast down with both their arms upon the rock they left the kindled fire, and said, No enemy is he.<br> 8 With his swift bow, strung truly, Brahmaṇaspati reaches the mark whateer it be that he desires.<br> Excellent are the arrows wherewithal he shoots, keen-eyed to look on men and springing from his ear.<br> 9 He brings together and he parts, the great High Priest; extolled is he, in battle Brahmaṇaspati.<br> When, gracious, for the hymn he brings forth food and wealth, the glowing Sun untroubled sends forth fervent heat.<br> 10 First and preeminent, excelling all besides are the kind gifts of liberal Bṛhaspati.<br> These are the boons of him the Strong who should be loved, whereby both classes and the people have delight.<br> 11 Thou who in every way supreme in earthly power, rejoicing, by thy mighty strength hast waxen great,<br> He is the God spread forth in breadth against the Gods: he, Brahmaṇaspati, encompasseth this All.<br> 12 From you, twain Maghavans, all truth proceedeth: even the waters break not your commandment.<br> Come to us, Brahmaṇaspati and Indra, to our oblation like yoked steeds to fodder.<br> 13 The sacrificial flames most swiftly hear the call: the priest of the assembly gaineth wealth for hymns.<br> Hating the stern, remitting at his will the debt, strong in the shock of fight is Brahmaṇaspati.<br> 14 The wrath of Brahmaṇaspati according to his will had full effect when he would do a mighty deed.<br> The kine he drave forth and distributed to heaven, even as a copious flood with strength flows sundry ways.<br> 15 O Brahmaṇaspati, may we be evermore masters of wealth well-guided, full of vital strength.<br> Heroes on heroes send abundantly to us, when thou omnipotent through prayer seekest my call.<br> 16 O Brahmaṇaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn, and prosper thou our children.<br> All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
