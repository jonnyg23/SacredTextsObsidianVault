 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XI. Agni.</h3>  
 <p>1. THE watchful Guardian of the people hath been born, Agni, the very strong, for fresh prosperity.<br> With oil upon his face, with high heaven-touching flame, he shineth splendidly, pure, for the Bharatas.<br> 2 Ensign of sacrifice, the earliest Household-Priest, the men have kindled Agni in his threefold seat,<br> With Indra and the Gods together on the grass let the wise Priest sit to complete the sacrifice.<br> 3 Pure , unadorned, from thy two Mothers art thou born: thou camest from Vivasvān as a charming Sage.<br> With oil they strengthened thee, O Agni, worshipped God: thy banner was the smoke that mounted to the sky.<br> 4 May Agni graciously come to our sacrifice. The men bear Agni here and there in every house.<br> He hath become an envoy, bearer of our gifts: electing Agni, men choose one exceeding wise.<br> 5 For thee, O Agni, is this sweetest prayer of mine: dear to thy spirit be this product of my thought.<br> As great streams fill the river so our song of praise fill thee, and make thee yet more mighty in thy strength.<br> 6 O Agni, the Aṅgirases discovered thee what time thou layest hidden, fleeing back from wood to wood.<br> Thou by attrition art produced as conquering might, and men, O Aṅgiras, call thee the Son of Strength.</p>
