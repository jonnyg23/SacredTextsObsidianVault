 <p>1. LOVING the loving One, as wives their husband, the sisters of one home have urged him forward,<br> Bright-coloured, even, as the cows love morning, dark, breaking forth to view, and redly beaming.<br> 2 Our sires with lauds burst een the firm-set fortress, yea, the Aṅgirases, with roar, the mountain.<br> They made for us a way to reach high heaven, they found us day, light, day's sign, beams of morning.<br> 3 They stablished order, made his service fruitful; then parting them among the longing faithful,<br> Not thirsting after aught, they come, most active, while with sweet food the race of Gods they strengthen.<br> 4 Since Mātariśvan, far-diffused, hath stirred him, and he in every house grown bright and noble,<br> He, Bhṛgu-like I hath gone as his companion, as on commission to a greater Sovran.<br> 5 When man poured juice to Heaven, the mighty Father, he knew and freed himself from close embracement.<br> The archer boldly shot at him his arrow, and the God threw his splendour on his Daughter.<br> 6 Whoso, hath flames for thee within his dwelling, or brings the worship which thou lovest daily,<br> Do thou of double might increase his substance: may he whom thou incitest meet with riches.<br> 7 All sacrificial viands wait on Agni as the Seven mighty Rivers seek the ocean.<br> Not by our brethren was our food discovered: find with the Gods care for us, thou who knowest.<br> 8 When light hath filled the Lord of men for increase, straight from the heaven descends the limpid moisture.<br> Agni hath brought to light and filled with spirit the youthful host blameless and well providing.<br> 9 He who like thought goes swiftly on his journey, the Sun, alone is ever Lord of riches.<br> The Kings with fair hands, Varuṇa and Mitra, protect the precious nectar in our cattle.<br> 10 O Agni, break not our ancestral friendship, Sage as thou art, endowed with deepest knowledge.<br> Old age, like gathering cloud, impairs the body: before that evil be come nigh protect me.</p>
