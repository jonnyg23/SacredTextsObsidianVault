 <p>1. I SING thy fame that, Maghavan, through thy Greatness the heavens and earth invoked thee in their terror,<br> Thou, aiding Gods, didst quell the power of Dāsas, what time thou holpest many a race, O Indra.<br> 2 When thou wast roaming, waxen strong in body, telling thy might, Indra, among the people,<br> All that men called thy battles was illusion: no foe hast thou to-day, nor erst hast found one.<br> 3 Who are the Ṛṣis, then, who comprehended before our time the bounds of all thy greatness?<br> For from thy body thou hast generated at the same time the Mother and the Father.<br> 4 Thou, Mighty Steer, hast four supremest natures, Asura natures that may neer be injured.<br> All these, O Maghavan, thou surely knowest, wherewith thou hast performed thy great achievements.<br> 5 Thou hast all treasures in thy sole possession, treasures made manifest and treasures hidden.<br> Defer not thou, O Maghavan, my longing: thou, art Director, Indra, thou art Giver.<br> 6 To him who set the light in things of splendour, and with all sweetness blent essential sweetness,<br> To Indra hath this welcome hymn that strengthens been uttered by the votary Bṛhaduktha.</p>
