 <p>1. MAY we obtain this day from you, O Waters, that wave of pure refreshment, which the pious<br> Made erst the special beverage of Indra, bright, stainless, rich in sweets and dropping fatness.<br> 2 May the Floods' Offspring, he whose course is rapid, protect that wave most rich in sweets, O Waters,<br> That shall make Indra and the Vasus joyful. This may we gain from you to-day, we pious.<br> 3 All-purifying, joying in their nature, to paths of Gods the Goddesses move onward.<br> They never violate the laws of Indra. Present the oil-rich offering to the Rivers.<br> 4 Whom Sūrya with his bright beams hath attracted, and Indra dug the path for them to travel,<br> May these Streams give us ample room and freedom. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
