 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LXXXII. Soma Pavamana.</h3>  
 <p>1. EVEN as a King hath Soma, red and tawny Bull, been pressed: the Wondrous One hath bellowed to the kine.<br> While purified he passes through the filtering fleece to seat him hawk-like on the place that drops with oil.<br> 2. To glory goest thou, Sage with disposing skill, like a groomed steed thou rusbest forward to the prize.<br> O Soma, be thou gracious, driving off distress: thou goest, clothed in butter, to a robe of state.<br> 3 Parjanya is the Father of the Mighty Bird: on mountains, in earth's centre hath he made his home.<br> The waters too have flowed, the Sisters, to the kine: he meets the pressing-stones at the beloved rite.<br> 4 Thou givest pleasure as a wife delights her lord. Listen, O Child of Pajri, for to thee I speak.<br> Amid the holy songs go on that we may live: in time of trouble, Soma, watch thou free from blame.<br> 5 As to the men of old thou camest, Indu unharmed, to strengthen, winning hundreds, thousands,<br> So now for new felicity flow onward: the waters follow as thy law ordaineth.</p>
