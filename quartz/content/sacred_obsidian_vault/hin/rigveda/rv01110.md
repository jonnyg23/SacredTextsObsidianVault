 <p>1. THE holy work I wrought before is wrought again: my sweetest hymn is sung to celebrate your praise.<br> Here, O ye Ṛbhus, is this sea for all the Gods: sate you with Soma offered with the hallowing word.<br> 2 When, seeking your enjoyment onward from afar, ye, certain of my kinsmen, wandered on your way,<br> Sons of Sudhanvan, after your long journeying, ye came unto the home of liberal Savitar.<br> 3 Savitar therefore gave you immortality, because ye came proclaiming him whom naught can hide;<br> And this the drinking-chalice of the Asura, which till that time was one, ye made to be fourfold.<br> 4 When they had served with zeal at sacrifice as priests, they, mortal as they were, gained immortality.<br> The Ṛbhus, children of Sudhanvan, bright as suns, were in a year's course made associate with prayers.<br> 5 The Ṛbhus, with a rod measured, as twere a field, the single sacrificial chalice. wide of mouth,<br> Lauded of all who saw, praying for what is best, desiring glorious fame among Immortal Gods.<br> 6 As oil in ladles, we through knowledge will present unto the Heroes of the firmament our hymn,<br> The Ṛbhus who came near with this great Father's speed, and rose to heaven's high sphere to eat the strengthening food.<br> 7 Ṛbhu to us is Indra freshest in his might, Ṛbhu with powers and wealth is giver of rich gifts.<br> Gods, through your favour may we on the happy day quell the attacks of those who pour no offerings forth.<br> 8 Out of a skin, O Ṛbhus, once ye formed a cow, and brought the mother close unto her calf again.<br> Sons of Sudhanvan, Heroes, with surpassing skill ye made your aged Parents youthful as before.<br> 9 Help us with strength where spoil is won, O Indra: joined with the Ṛbhus give us varied bounty.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
