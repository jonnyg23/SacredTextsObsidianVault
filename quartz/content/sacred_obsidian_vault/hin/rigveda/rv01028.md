 <p>1 THERE where the broad-based stone raised on high to press the juices out,<br> O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.<br> 2 Where, like broad hips, to hold the juice the platters of the press are laid,<br> O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.<br> 3 There where the woman marks and leans the pestle's constant rise and fall,<br> O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.<br> 4 Where, as with reins to guide a horse, they bind the churning-staff with cords,<br> O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.<br> 5 If of a truth in every house, O Mortar thou art set for work,<br> Here give thou forth thy clearest sound, loud as the drum of conquerors.<br> 6 O Sovran of the Forest, as the wind blows soft in front of thee,<br> Mortar, for Indra press thou forth the Soma juice that he may drink.<br> 7 Best strength-givers, ye stretch wide jaws, O Sacrificial Implements,<br> Like two bay horses champing herbs.<br> 8 Ye Sovrans of the Forest, both swift, with swift pressers press to-day<br> Sweet Soma juice for Indra's drink.<br> 9 Take up in beakers what remains: the Soma on the filter pour,<br> and on the ox-hide set the dregs.</p>
