 <p>1. HASTING like some strong courser good at drawing, a thought have I imagined like a workman.<br> Pondering what is dearest and most noble, I long to see the sages full of wisdom.<br> 2 Ask of the sages' mighty generations firm-minded and devout they framed the heaven.<br> These are thy heart-sought strengthening directions, and they have come to be sky's upholders.<br> 3 Assuming in this world mysterious natures, they decked the heaven and earth for high dominion,<br> Measured with measures, fixed their broad expanses, set the great worlds apart held firm for safety.<br> 4 Even as he mounted up they all adorned him: self-luminous he travels clothed in splendour.<br> That is the Bull's, the Asura's mighty figure: he, omniform, hath reached the eternal waters.<br> 5 First the more ancient Bull engendered offspring; these are his many draughts that lent him vigour.<br> From days of old ye Kings, two Sons of Heaven, by hymns of sacrifice have won dominion.<br> 6 Three seats ye Sovrans, in the Holy synod, many, yea, all, ye honour with your presence.<br> There saw I, going thither in the spirit, Gandharvas in their course with wind-blown tresses.<br> 7 That same companionship of her, the Milch-cow, here with the strong Bull's divers forms they stablished.<br> Enduing still some new celestial figure, the skilful workers shaped a form around him.<br> 8 Let no one here debar me from enjoying the golden light which Savitar diffuses.<br> He covers both all-fostering worlds with praises even as a woman cherishes her children.<br> 9 Fulfil, ye twain, his work, the Great, the Ancient: as heavenly blessing keep your guard around us.<br> All the wise Gods behold his varied actions who stands erect, whose voice is like a herdsman's.<br> 10 Call we on Indra, Maghavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
