 <p>1. IN offerings poured to you, O Indra-Varuṇa, these shares of yours stream forth to glorify your state.<br> Ye haste to the libations at each sacrifice when ye assist the worshipper who sheds the juice.<br> 2 The waters and the plants, O Indra-Varuṇa, had efficacious vigour, and attained to might:<br> Ye who have gone beyond the path of middle air,no godless man is worthy to be called your foe.<br> 3 True is your Krsa's word, Indra and Varuṇa: The seven holy voices pour a wave of meath.<br> For their sake, Lords of splendour! aid the pious man who, unbewildered, keeps you ever in his thoughts.<br> 4 Dropping oil, sweet with Soma, pouring forth their stream, are the Seven Sisters in the seat of sacrifice.<br> These, dropping oil, are yours, O Indra-Varuṇa: with these enrich with gifts and help the worshipper.<br> 5 To our great happiness have we ascribed to these Two Bright Ones truthfulness, great strength, and majesty.<br> O Lords of splendour, aid us through the Three-times-Seven, as we pour holy oil, O Indra-Varuṇa.<br> 6 What ye in time of old Indra and Varuṇa, gave Ṛṣis revelation, thought, and power of song,<br> And places which the wise made, weaving sacrifice,these through my spirit's fervid glow have I beheld.,<br> 7 O Indra-Varuṇa, grant to the worshippers cheerfulness void of pride, and wealth to nourish them.</p>
