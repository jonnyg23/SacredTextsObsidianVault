 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XXVI. Indra.</h3>  
 <p>1. SOMA unpressed neer gladdened liberal Indra, no juices pressed without a prayer have pleased him.<br> I generate a laud that shall delight him, new and heroic, so that he may hear us.<br> 2 At every laud the Soma gladdens Indra: pressed juices please him as each psalm is chanted,<br> What time the priests with one united effort call him to aid, as sons invoke their father.<br> 3 These deeds he did; let him achieve new exploits, such as the priests declare at their libations.<br> Indra hath taken and possessed all castles, like as one common husband doth his spouses.<br> 4 Even thus have they declared him. Famed is Indra as Conqueror, sole distributer of treasures;<br> Whose many succours come in close succession. May dear delightful benefits attend us.<br> 5 Thus, to bring help to men, Vasiṣṭha laudeth Indra, the peoples' Hero, at libation.<br> Bestow upon us strength and wealth in thousands. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
