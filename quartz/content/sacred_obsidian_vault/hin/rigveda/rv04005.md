 <p>1. How shall we give with one accord oblation to Agni, to Vaiśvānara the Bounteous?<br> Great light, with full high growth hath he uplifted, and, as a pillar bears the roof, sustains it.<br> 2 Reproach not him who, God and self-reliant, vouchsafed this bounty unto me a mortal,<br> Deathless, discerner, wise, to me the simple, Vaiśvānara most manly, youthful Agni.<br> 3 Sharp-pointed, powerful, strong, of boundless vigour, Agni who knows the lofty hymn, kept secret<br> As the lost milch-cow's track, the doubly Mighty,he hath declared to me this hidden knowledge.<br> 4 May he with sharpened teeth, the Bounteous Giver, Agni, consume with flame most fiercely glowing.<br> Those who regard not Varuṇa's commandments and the dear stedfast laws of sapient Mitra.<br> 5 Like youthful women without brothers, straying, like dames who hate their lords, of evil conduct,<br> They who are full of sin, untrue, unfaithful, they have engendered this abysmal station.<br> 6 To me, weak, innocent, thou, luminous Agni, hast boldly given as twere a heavy burthen,<br> This Pṛṣṭha hymn, profound and strong and mighty, of seven elements, and with offered dainties.<br> 7 So may our song that purifies, through wisdom reach in a moment him the Universal,<br> Established on the height, on earth's best station, above the beauteous grassy skin of Pṛśni.<br> 8 Of this my speech what shall I utter further? They indicate the milk stored up in secret<br> When they have thrown as twere the cows' stalls open. The Bird protects earths best and well-loved station.<br> 9 This is the Great Ones mighty apparition which from of old the radiant Cow hath followed.<br> This, shining brightly in the place of Order, swift, hasting on in secret, she discovered.<br> 10 He then who shone together with his Parents remembered Pṛśni's fair and secret treasure,<br> Which, in the Mother Cow's most lofty station, the Bull's tongue, of the flame bent forward, tasted.<br> 11 With reverence I declare the Law, O Agni; what is, comes by thine order, Jātavedas.<br> Of this, whateer it be, thou art the Sovran, yea, all the wealth that is in earth or<br> heaven.<br> 12 What is our wealth therefrom, and what our treasure? Tell us O Jātavedas, for thou<br> knowest,<br> What is our best course in this secret passage: we, unreproached, have reached a place far distant.<br> 13 What is the limit, what the rules, the guerdon? Like fleet-foot coursers speed we to the contest.<br> When will the Goddesses, the Immortal's Spouses, the Dawns, spread over us the Sun-God's splendour?<br> 14 Unsatisfied, with speech devoid of vigour, scanty and frivolous and inconclusive,<br> Wherefore do they address thee here, O Agni? Let these who have no weapons suffer sorrow.<br> 15 The majesty of him the Good, the Mighty, aflame, hath shone for glory in the dwelling.<br> He, clothed in light, hath shone most fair to look on, wealthy in boons, as a home shines with riches.</p>
