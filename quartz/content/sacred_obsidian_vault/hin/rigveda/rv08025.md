 <p>1. I WORSHIP you who guard this All, Gods, holiest among the Gods,<br> You, faithful to the Law, whose power is sanctified.<br> 2 So, too, like charioteers are they, Mitra and sapient Varuṇa,<br> Sons high-born from of old, whose holy laws stand fast.<br> 3 These Twain, possessors of all wealth, most glorious, for supremest sway<br> Aditi, Mighty Mother, true to Law, brought forth.<br> 4 Great Varuṇa and Mitra, Gods, Asuras and imperial Lords,<br> True to Eternal Law proclaim the high decree.<br> 5 The offspring of a lofty Power, Dakṣa's Two Sons exceeding strong,<br> Who, Lords of flowing rain, dwell in the place of food.<br> 6 Ye who have gathered up your gifts, celestial and terrestrial food,<br> Let your rain come to us fraught with the mist of heaven.<br> 7 The Twain, who from the lofty sky seem to look down on herds below,<br> Holy, imperial Lords, are set to be revered.<br> 8 They, true to Law, exceeding strong, have sat them down for savran rule:<br> Princes whose laws stand fast, they have obtained their sway.<br> 9 Pathfinders even better than the eye, with unobstructed sight,<br> Even when they close their lids, observant, they perceive.<br> 10 So may the Goddess Aditi, may the Nāsatyas guard us well,<br> The Martits guard us well,.endowed with mighty strength.<br> 11 Do ye, O Bounteous Gods, protect our dwelling lace by day and night:<br> With you for our defenders may we go unharmed.<br> 12 May we, unharmed, serve bountiful Viṣṇu, the God who slayeth none:<br> Self-moving Sindhu hear and be the first to mark.<br> 13 This sure protection we elect, desirable and reaching far,<br> Which Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman afford.<br> 14 And may the Sindhu of the floods, the Maruts, and the ASvin Pair,<br> Boon Indra, and boon Viṣṇu have one mind with us.<br> 15 Because these warring Heroes stay the enmity of every foe,<br> As the fierce water-flood repels the furious ones.<br> 16 Here this one God, the Lord of men, looks forth exceeding far and wide:<br> And we, for your advantage, keep his holy laws.<br> 17 We keep the old accustomed laws, the statutes of supremacy,<br> The Iong-known laws of Mitra and of Varuṇa.<br> 18 He who hath measured with his ray the boundaries of heaven and earth,<br> And with his majesty hath filled the two worlds full,<br> 19 Sūrya hath spread his light aloft up to the region of the sky,<br> Like Agni all aflame when gifts are offered him.<br> 20 With him who sits afar the word is lord of food that comes from kine,<br> Controller of the gift of unempoisoned food.<br> 21 So unto Sūrya, Heaven, and Earth at morning and at eve I speak.<br> Bringing enjoyments ever rise thou up for us.<br> 22 From Uksanyayana a bay, from Harayana a white steed,<br> And from Susaman we obtained a hamessed car.<br> 23 These two shall bring me further gain of troops of tawny-coloured steeds,<br> The carriers shall they be of active men of war.<br> 24 And the two sages have I gained who hold the reins and bear the whip,<br> And the two great strong coursers, with my newest song.</p>
