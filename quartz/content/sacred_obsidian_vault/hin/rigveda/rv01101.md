 <p>1. SING, with oblation, praise to him who maketh glad, who with Ṛjiśvan drove the dusky brood away.<br> Fain for help, him the strong whose right hand wields the bolt, him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 2 Indra, who with triumphant wrath smote Vyaṁsa down, and Śambara, and Pipru the unrighteous one;<br> Who extirpated Śuṣṇa the insatiate,him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 3 He whose great work of manly might is heaven and earth, and Varuṇa and Sūrya keep his holy law;<br> Indra, whose law the rivers follow as they flow,him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 4 He who is Lord and Master of the steeds and kine, honouredthe firm and sureat every holy act;<br> Stayer even of the strong who pours no offering out,him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 5 He who is Lord of all the world that moves and breathes, who for the Brahman first before all found the Cows;<br> Indra who cast the Dasyus down beneath his feet,him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 6 Whom cowards must invoke and valiant men of war, invoked by those who conquer and by those who flee;<br> Indra, to whom all beings turn their constant thought,him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 7 Refulgent in the Rudras region he proceeds, and with the Rudras through the wide space speeds the Dame.<br> The hymn of praise extols Indra the far-renowned: him girt by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.<br> 8 O girt by Maruts, whether thou delight thee in loftiest gathering-place or lowly dwelling,<br> Come thence unto our rite, true boon-bestower: through love of thee have we prepared oblations.<br> 9 We, fain for thee, strong Indra, have pressed Soma, and, O thou sought with prayer, have made oblations.<br> Now at this sacrifice, with all thy Maruts, on sacred grass, O team-borne God, rejoice thee.<br> 10 Rejoice thee with thine own Bay Steeds, O Indra, unclose thy jaws and let thy lips be open.<br> Thou with the fair cheek, let thy Bay Steeds bring thee: gracious to us, he pleased with our oblation.<br> 11 Guards of the camp whose praisers are the Maruts, may we through Indra, get ourselves the booty.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
