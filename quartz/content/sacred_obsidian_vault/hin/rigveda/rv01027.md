 <p>1 WITH worship will I glorify thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed,<br> Imperial Lord of sacred rites.<br> 2 May the far-striding Son of Strength, bringer of great felicity,<br> Who pours his gifts like rain, be ours.<br> 3 Lord of all life, from near; from far, do thou, O Agni evermore<br> Protect us from the sinful man.<br> 4 O Agni, graciously announce this our oblation to the Gods,<br> And this our newest song of praise.<br> 5 Give us a share of strength most high, a share of strength that is below,<br> A share of strength that is between.<br> 6 Thou dealest gifts, resplendent One; nigh, as with waves of Sindhu, thou<br> Swift streamest to the worshipper.<br> 7 That man is lord of endless strength whom thou protectest in the fight,<br> Agni, or urgest to the fray.<br> 8 Him, whosoever he may be, no man may vanquish, mighty One:<br> Nay, very glorious power is his.<br> 9 May he who dwells with all mankind bear us with war-steeds through the fight,<br> And with the singers win the spoil.<br> 10 Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, this eulogy to Rudra, him<br> Adorable in every house.<br> 11 May this our God, great, limitless, smoke-bannered excellently bright,<br> Urge us to strength and holy thought.<br> 12 Like some rich Lord of men may he, Agni the banner of the Gods,<br> Refulgent, hear us through our lauds.<br> 13 Glory to Gods, the mighty and the lesser glory to Gods the younger and the elder!<br> Let us, if we have power, pay the God worship: no better prayer than this, ye Gods, acknowledge.</p>
