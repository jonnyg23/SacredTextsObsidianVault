 <p>1. I WAS the first possessor of all precious gear: the wealth of every man I win and gather up.<br> On me as on a Father living creatures call; I deal enjoyment to tho. man who offers gifts.<br> 2 I, Indra, am Atharvan's stay and firm support: I brought forth kine to Trita from the Dragon's grasp.<br> I stripped the Dasyus of their manly might, and gave the cattle-stalls to Matarigvan and Dadhyac.<br> 3 For me hath Tvaṣṭar forged the iron thunderbolt: in me the Gods have centred intellectual power.<br> My sheen is like the Sun's insufferably bright: men honour me as Lord for past and future deeds.<br> 4 I won myself these herdi of cattle, steeds and kine, and gold in ample store, with my destructive bolt.<br> I give full many a thousand to the worshipper, what time the Somas and the lauds have made me glad.<br> 5 Indra am I none ever wins my wealth from me never at any time am I a thrall to death.<br> Pressing the Soma, ask riches from me alone: ye, Pūrus, in my friendship shall not suffer harm.<br> 6 These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray,<br> The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers.<br> This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me?<br> Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?<br> 8 Against the Gungus I made Atithigva strong, and kept him mid the folk like Vṛtra-conquering strength,<br> When I won glory in the great foe-slaying fight, in battle where Karanja fell, and Parṇaya.<br> 9 With food for mine enjoyment Sapya Nami came: he joined me as a friend of old in search of kine.<br> As I bestowed on him an arrow for the fight I made him worthy of the song apd hymn of praise.<br> 10 One of the two hath Soma, seen within it; the Herdsman with the bone shows forth the other.<br> He, fain to fight the Bull whose horns were sharpened, stood fettered in the demon's ample region.<br> 11 I, as a God, neer violate the statutes of Gods, of Vasus, Rudriyas, Ādityas.<br> These Gods have formed me for auspicious vigour, unconquered and invincible for ever.</p>
