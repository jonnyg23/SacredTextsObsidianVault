 <p>1. AGNI, best winner of the spoil, cause us to praise before the Gods<br> As our associate meet for lauds, wealth which thou verily deemest wealth.<br> 2 Agni, the great who ward not off the anger of thy power and might<br> Stir up the wrath and hatred due to one who holds an alien creed.<br> 3 Thee, Agni, would we choose as Priest, the perfecter of strength and skill;<br> We who bring sacred food invoke with song thee Chief at holy rites.<br> 4 Here as is needful for thine aid we toil, O Conqueror, day by day,<br> For wealth, for Law. May we rejoice, Most Wise One! at the feast, with kine, rejoice, with heroes, at the feast.</p>
