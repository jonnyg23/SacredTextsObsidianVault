 <p>1. THE sacrifice drawn out with threads on every side, stretched by a hundred sacred ministers and one,<br> This do these Fathers weave who hitherward are come: they sit beside the warp and cry, Weave forth, weave back.<br> 2 The Man extends it and the Man unbinds it: even to this vault of heaven hath he outspun, it.<br> These pegs are fastened to the seat of worship: they made the Sāma-hymns their weaving shuttles.<br> 3 What were the rule, the order and the model? What were the wooden fender and the butter?<br> What were the hymn, the chant, the recitation, when to the God all Deities paid worship?<br> 4 Closely was Gāyatrī conjoined with Agni, and closely Savitar combined with Usnih.<br> Brilliant with Ukthas, Soma joined Anustup: Bṛhaspati's voice by Brhati was aided.<br> 5 Virāj adhered to Varuṇa and Mitra: here Triṣṭup day by day was Indra's portion.<br> Jagatī entered all the Gods together: so by this knowledge men were raised to Ṛṣis.<br> 6 So by this knowledge men were raised to Ṛṣis, when ancient sacrifice sprang up, our Fathers.<br> With the mind's eye I think that I behold them who first performed this sacrificial worship.<br> 7 They who were versed in ritual and metre, in hymns and rules, were the Seven Godlike Ṛṣis.<br> Viewing the path of those of old, the sages have taken up the reins like chariot-drivers.</p>
