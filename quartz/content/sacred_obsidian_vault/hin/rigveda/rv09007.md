 <p>1. FORTH on their way the glorious drops have flowed for maintenance of Law,<br> Knowing this sacrifice's course.<br> 2 Down in the mighty waters sinks the stream of meath, most excellent,<br> Oblation best of all in worth.<br> 3 About the holy place, the Steer true, guileless, noblest, hath sent forth<br> Continuous voices in the wood.<br> 4 When, clothed in manly strength, the Sage flows in celestial wisdom round,<br> The Strong would win the light of heaven.<br> 5 When purified, he sits as King above the hosts, among his folk,<br> What time the sages bring him nigh.<br> 6 Dear, golden-coloured, in the fleece he sinks and settles in the wood:<br> The Singer shows his zeal in hymns.<br> 7 He goes to Indra, Vāyu, to the Aśvins, as his custom is,<br> With gladdening juice which gives them joy.<br> 8 Tle streams of pleasant Soma flow to Bhaga, Mitra-Varuṇa,<br> Well-knowing through his mighty powers.<br> Heaven and Earth, riches of meath to win us wealth:<br> Gain for us treasures and renown.</p>
