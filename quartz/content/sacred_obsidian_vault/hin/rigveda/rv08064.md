 <p>1. YOKE, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invite the Gods: As ancient Herald seat thyself.<br> 2 And, God, as skilfullest of all, call for us hitherward the Gods:<br> Give all our wishes sure effect.<br> 3 For thou, Most Youthful, Son of Strength, thou to whom sacrifice is paid,<br> Art holy, faithful to the Law.<br> 4 This Agni, Lord of wealth and spoil hundredfold, thousandfold, is head<br> And chief of riches and a Sage.<br> 5 As craftsmen bend the felly, so bend at our general call: come nigh,<br> Aṅgiras, to the sacrifice.<br> 6 Now, O Virūpa, rouse for him, Strong God who shines at early morn,<br> Fair praise with voice that ceases not.<br> 7 With missile of this Agni, his who looks afar, will we lay low<br> The thief in combat for the kine.<br> 8 Let not the Companies of Gods fail us, like Dawns that float away,<br> Like cows who leave the niggardly.<br> 9 Let not the sinful tyranny of any fiercely hating foe<br> Smite us, as billows smite a ship.<br> 10 O Agni, God, the people sing reverent praise to thee for strength:<br> With terrors trouble thou the foe.<br> 11 Wilt thou not, Agni, lend us aid in winning cattle, winning wealth?<br> Maker of room, make room for us.<br> 12 In this great battle cast us not aside as one who bears a load:<br> Snatch up the wealth and win it all.<br> 13 O Agni, let this plague pursue and fright another and not us:<br> Make our impetuous strength more strong.<br> 14 The reverent or unwearied man whose holy labour he accepts,<br> Him Agni favours with success.<br> 15 Abandoning the foeman's host pass hither to this company:<br> Assist the men with whom I stand.<br> 16 As we have known thy gracious help, as of a Father, long ago,<br> So now we pray to thee for bliss.</p>
