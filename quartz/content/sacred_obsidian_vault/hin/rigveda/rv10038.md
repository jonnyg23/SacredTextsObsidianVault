 <p>1. O INDRA, in this battle great and glorious, in this loud din of war help us to victory,<br> Where in the strife for kine among bold ring-decked men arrows fly all around and heroes are subdued.<br> 2 At home disclose to us opulence rich in food, streaming with milk, O Indra, meet to be renowned.<br> Śakra, may we be thine, the friendly Conqueror's: even as we desire, O Vasu, so do thou.<br> 3 The godless man, much-lauded Indra, whether he be Dāsa or be Ārya, who would war with us,<br> Easy to conquer he for thee, with us, these foes: with thee may we subdue them in the clash of fight.<br> 4 Him who must be invoked by many and by few, who standeth nigh with comfort in the war of men,<br> Indra, famed Hero, winner in the deadly strife, let us bring hitherward to-day to favour us.<br> 5 For, Indra, I have heard thee called Self. capturer, One, Steer! who never yields, who urges even the churl.<br> Release thyself from Kutsa and come hither. How shall one like thee sit still bound that he may not move?</p>
