 <p>1. WHERE in the heavens are ye to-day, Gods, Aśvins, rich in constancy?<br> Hear this, ye excellent as Steers: Atri inviteth you to come.<br> 2 Where are they now? Where are the Twain, the famed Nāsatyas, Gods in heaven?<br> Who is the man ye strive to reach? Who of your suppliants is with you?<br> 3 Whom do ye visit, whom approach? to whom direct your harnessed car?<br> With whose devotions are ye pleased? We long for you to further us.<br> 4 Ye, Strengtheners, for Paura stir the filler swimming in the flood,<br> Advancing to be captured like a lion to the ambuscade.<br> 5 Ye from cyavana worn with age removed his skin as twere a robe.<br> So, when ye made him young again, he stirred the longing of a dame.<br> 6 Here is the man who lauds you both: to see your glory are we here.<br> Now bear me, come with saving help, ye who are rich in store of wealth.<br> 7 Who among many mortal men this day hath won you to himself?<br> What bard, accepters of the bard? Who, rich in wealth! with sacrifice?<br> 8 O Aśvins, may your car approach, most excellent of cars for speed.<br> Through many regions may our praise pass onward among mortal men.<br> 9 May our laudation of you Twain, lovers of meath! be sweet to you.<br> Fly hitherward, ye wise of heart, like falcons with your winged steeds.<br> 10 O Aśvins, when at any time ye listen to this call of mine,<br> For you is dainty food prepared: they mix refreshing food for you.</p>
