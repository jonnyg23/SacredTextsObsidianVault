 <p>1 THE chanters hymn thee, they who say the word of praise magnify thee.<br> The priests have raised thee up on high, O Śatakratu, like a pole.<br> 2 As up he clomb from ridge to ridge and looked upon the toilsome task,<br> Indra observes this wish of his, and the Rain hastens with his troop.<br> 3 Harness thy pair of strong bay steeds, long-maned, whose bodies fill the girths,<br> And, Indra, Soma-drinker, come to listen to our songs of praise.<br> 4 Come hither, answer thou the song, sing in approval, cry aloud.<br> Good Indra, make our prayer succeed, and prosper this our sacrifice.<br> 5 To Indra must a laud be said, to strengthen him who freely gives,<br> That Śakra may take pleasure in our friendship and drink-offerings.<br> 6 Him, him we seek for friendship, him for riches and heroic might.<br> For Indra, he is Śakra, he shall aid us while he gives us wealth.<br> 7 Easy to turn and drive away, Indra, is spoil bestowed by thee.<br> Unclose the stable of the kine, and give us wealth O Thunder-armed<br> 8 The heaven and earth contain thee not, together, in thy wrathful mood.<br> Win us the waters of the sky, and send us kine abundantly.<br> 9 Hear, thou whose ear is quick, my call; take to thee readily my songs<br> O Indra, let this laud of mine come nearer even than thy friend.<br> 10 We know thee mightiest of all, in battles hearer of our cry.<br> Of thee most mighty we invoke the aid that giveth thousandfold.<br> 11 O Indra, Son of Kuśika, drink our libation with delight.<br> Prolong our life anew, and cause the seer to win a thousand gifts.<br> 12 Lover of song, may these our songs on every side encompass thee:<br> Strengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear delights to thee.</p>
