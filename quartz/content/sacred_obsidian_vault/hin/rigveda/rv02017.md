 <p>1. LIKE the Aṅgirases, sing this new song forth to him, for, as in ancient days, his mighty powers are shown,<br> When in the rapture of the Soma he unclosed with strength the solid firm-shut stables of the kine.<br> 2 Let him be even that God who, for the earliest draught measuring out his power, increased his majesty;<br> Hero who fortified his body in the wars, and through his greatness set the heaven upon his head.<br> 3 Thou didst perform thy first great deed of hero might what time thou showedst power, through prayer, before this folk.<br> Hurled down by thee the car-borne Lord of Tawny Steeds, the congregated swift ones fled in sundry ways.<br> 4 He made himself by might Lord of all living things, and strong in vital power waxed great above them all.<br> He, borne on high, oerspread with light the heaven and earth, and, sewing up the turbid darkness, closed it in.<br> 5 He with his might made firm the forward-bending hills, the downward rushing of the waters he ordained.<br> Fast he upheld the earth that nourisheth all life, and stayed the heaven from falling by his wondrous skill.<br> 6 Fit for the grasping of his arms is what the Sire hath fabricated from all kind of precious wealth.<br> The thunderbolt, wherewith, loud-roaring, he smote down, and striking him to death laid Krivi on the earth.<br> 7 As she who in her parents' house is growing old, I pray to thee as Bhaga from the seat of all.<br> Grant knowledge, mete it out and bring it to us here: give us the share wherewith thou makest people glad.<br> 8 May we invoke thee as a liberal giver thou givest us, O Indra, strength and labours.<br> Help us with manifold assistance, Indra: <a href="errata.htm#11">Mighty</a> One, Indra, make us yet more wealthy.<br> 9 Now may that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to him who lauds thee.<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
