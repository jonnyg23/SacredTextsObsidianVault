 <p>1. DRAUGHTS of this sweet juice have been drunk for rapture, of the wise Soma-presser's offered dainty,<br> Wherein, grown mighty in the days aforetime, Indra hath found delight, and men who worship.<br> 2 Cheered by this meath Indra, whose hand wields thunder, rent piecemeal Ahi who barred up the waters,<br> So that the quickening currents of the rivers flowed forth like birds unto their resting-places.<br> 3 Indra, this Mighty One, the Dragon's slayer, sent forth the flood of waters to the ocean.<br> He gave the Sun his life, he found the cattle, and with the night the works of days completed.<br> 4 To him who worshippeth hath Indra given many and matchless gifts. He slayeth Vṛtra.<br> Straight was he to be sought with supplications by men who struggled to obtain the sunlight.<br> 5 To him who poured him gifts he gave up Sūrya,Indra, the God, the Mighty, to the mortal;<br> For Etaśa with worship brought him riches that keep distress afar, as twere his portion.<br> 6 Once to the driver of his chariot, Kutsa, he gave up greedy Sūrya, plague of harvest;<br> And Indra, for the sake of Divodāsa demolished Śambara's nine-and-ninety castles.<br> 7 So have we brought our hymn to thee, O Indra, strengthening thee and fain ourselves for glory.<br> May we with best endeavours gain this friendship, and mayst thou bend the godless scorner's weapons.<br> 8 Thus the Gṛtsamadas for thee, O Hero, have wrought their hymn and task as seeking favour.<br> May they who worship thee afresh, O Indra, gain food and strength, bliss, and a happy dwelling.<br> 9 Now may that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to him who lauds thee,<br> Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
