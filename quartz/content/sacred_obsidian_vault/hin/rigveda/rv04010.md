 <p>1. This day with praises, Agni, we bring thee that which thou lovest.<br> Right judgment, like a horse, with our devotions.<br> 2 For thou hast ever been the Car-driver, Agni, of noble<br> Strength, lofty sacrifice, and rightful judgment.<br> 3 Through these our praises come thou to meet us, bright as the sunlight,<br> O Agni, well disposed, with all thine aspects.<br> 4 Now may we serve thee singing these lauds this day to thee, Agni.<br> Loud as the voice of Heaven thy blasts are roaring.<br> 5 Just at this time of the day and the night thy look is the sweetest:<br> It shineth near us even as gold for glory.<br> 6 Spotless thy body, brilliant as gold, like clarified butter:<br> This gleams like gold on thee, O Self. dependent.<br> 7 All hate and mischief, yea, if committed, Agni, thou turnest,<br> Holy One, from the man who rightly worships.<br> 8 Agni, with you Gods, prosperous be our friendships and kinships.<br> Be this our bond here by this place, thine altar.</p>
