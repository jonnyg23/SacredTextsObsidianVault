 <p>1. As, Śakra, thou with Manu called Vivasvān drankest Soma juice,<br> As, Indra, thou didst love the hymn by Trita's side, so dost thou joy with Āyu now.<br> 2 As thou with Mātariśvan, Medhya, Prsadhra, hast cheered thee Indra, with pressed juice,<br> Drunk Soma with Rjunas, Syūmaraśmi, by Dasonya's Dasasipra's side.<br> 3 Tis he who made the lauds his own and boldly drank the Soma juice,<br> He to whom Viṣṇu came striding his three wide steps, as Mitra's statutes ordered it.<br> 4 In whose laud thou didst joy, Indra, at the great deed, O Śatakratu, Mighty One!<br> Seeking renown we call thee as the milkers call the cow who yields abundant milk.<br> 5 He is our Sire who gives to us, Great, Mighty, ruling as he wills.<br> Unsought, may he the Strong, Rich, Lord of ample wealth, give us of horses and of kine.<br> 6 He to whom thou, Good Lord, givest that he may give increases wealth that nourishes.<br> Eager for wealth we call on Indra, Lord of wealth, on Śatakratu with our lauds.<br> 7 Never art thou neglectful: thou guardest both races with thy care.<br> The call on Indra, fourth Āditya! is thine own. Amṛta is stablished in the heavens.<br> 8 The offercr whom thou, Indra, Lover of the Song, liberal Maghavan, favourest,<br> As at the call of Kaṇva so, O gracious Lord, hear, thou our songs and eulogy.<br> 9 Sung is the song of ancient time: to Indra have ye said the prayer.<br> They have sung many a Brhati of sacrifice, poured forth the worshipper's many thoughts.<br> 10 Indra hath tossed together mighty stores of wealth, and both the worlds, yea, and the Sun.<br> Pure, brightly-shining, mingled with the milk, the draughts of Soma have made Indra glad.</p>
