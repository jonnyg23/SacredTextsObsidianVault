 <p>1. I TRUST in thy first wrathful deed, O Indra, when thou slewest Vṛtra and didst work to profit man;<br> What time the two world-halves fell short of thee in might, and the earth trembled at thy force, O Thunder-anned.<br> 2 Thou with thy magic powers didst rend the conjurer Vṛtra, O Blameless One, with heart that longed for fame.<br> Heroes elect thee when they battle for the prey, thee in all sacrifices worthy of renown.<br> 3 God Much-invoked, take pleasure in these princes here, who, thine exalters, Maghavan, have come to wealth.<br> In synods, when the rite succeeds, they hymn the Strong for sons and progeny and riches undisturbed.<br> 4 That man shall find delight in well-protected wealth whose care provides for him the quick-sought joyous draught.<br> Bringing oblations, strengthened Maghavan, by thee, he swiftly wins the spoil with heroes in the fight.<br> 5 Now for our band, O Maghavan, when lauded, make ample room with might, and grant us riches.<br> Magician thou, our Varuṇa and Mitra, deal food to us, O Wondrous, as Dispenser.</p>
