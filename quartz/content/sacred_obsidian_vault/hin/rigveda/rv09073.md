 <p>1. THEY from the spouting drop have sounded at the rim: naves speed together to the place of sacrifice.<br> That Asura hath formed, to seize, three lofty heights. The ships of truth have borne the pious man across.<br> 2 The strong Steers, gathering, have duly stirred themselves,and over the stream's wave the friends sent forth the song.<br> Engendering the hymn, with flowing streams of meath, Indra's dear body have they caused to wax in strength.<br> 3 With sanctifying gear they sit around the song: their ancient Father guards their holy work from harm.<br> Varuṇa hath oerspread the mighty sea of air. Sages had power to hold him in sustaining floods.<br> 4 Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have sent their voices down togetlier, in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams.<br> His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place are found the bonds that bind man last.<br> 5 O'er Sire and Mother they have roared in unison bright with the verse of praise, burning up riteless men,<br> Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the swarthy skin which Indra hates.<br> 6 Those which, as guides of song and counsellors of speed, were manifested from their ancient dwelling place,<br> From these the eyeless and the deaf have turned aside: the wicked travel not the pathway of the Law.<br> 7 What time the filter with a thousand streams is stretched, the thoughtful sages purify their song therein.<br> Bright-coloured are their spies, vigorous, void of guile, excellent, fair to see, beholders of mankind.<br> 8 Guardian of Law, most wise, he may not be deceived: three Purifiers hath he set within his heart.<br> With wisdom he beholds all creatures that exist: he drives into the pit the hated riteliess ones.<br> 9 The thread of sacrifice spun in the cleansing sieve, on Varuṇa's tongue-tip, by supernatural might,<br> This, by their striving, have the prudent ones attained: he who hath not this power shall sink into the pit.</p>
