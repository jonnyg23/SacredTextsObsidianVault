 <p>1. As cows low to their calves in stalls, so with our songs we glorify<br> This Indra, even your Wondrous God who checks attack, who joys in the delicious juice.<br> 2 Celestial, bounteous Giver, girt about with might, rich, mountain-like, in precious things,<br> Him swift we seek. for foodful booty rich in kine, brought hundredfold and thousandfold.<br> 3 Indra, the strong and lofty hills are powerless to bar thy way.<br> None stay that act of thine when thou wouldst fain give wealth to one like me who sings thy praise.<br> 4 A Warrior thou by strength, wisdom, and wondrous deed, in might excellest all that is.<br> Hither may this our hymn attract thee to our help, the hymn which Gotamas have made.<br> 5 For in thy might thou stretchest out beyond the boundaries of heaven.<br> The earthly region, Indra, comprehends thee not. After thy Godhead hast thou waxed.<br> 6 When, Maghavan, thou honourest the worshipper, no one is there to stay thy wealth.<br> Most liberal Giver thou, do thou inspire our song of praise, that we may win the spoil.</p>
