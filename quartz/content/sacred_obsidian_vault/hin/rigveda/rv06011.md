 <p>1. EAGERLY Sacrifice thou, most skilful, Agni! Priest, pressing on as if the Maruts sent thee.<br> To our oblation bring the two Nāsatyas, Mitra and Varuṇa and Earth and Heaven.<br> 2 Thou art our guileless, most delightful Herald, the God, among mankind, of holy synods.<br> A Priest with purifying tongue, O Agni, sacrifice with thy mouth to thine own body.<br> 3 For even the blessed longing that is in thee would bring the Gods down to the singer's worship,<br> When the Aṅgirases' sagest Sage, the Poet, sings the sweet measure at the solemn service.<br> 4 Bright hath he beamed, the wise, the far-refulgent. Worship the two widespreading Worlds, O Agni,<br> Whom as the Living One rich in oblations the Five Tribes, bringing gifts, adorn with homage.<br> 5 When I with reverence clip the grass for Agni, when the trimmed ladle, fullof oil, is lifted,<br> Firm on the seat of earth is based the altar: eye-like, the sacrifice is directed Sun-ward.<br> 6 Enrich us, O thou Priest of many aspects, with the Gods, Agni, with thy fires, enkindled.<br> O Son of Strength, clad in the robe of riches, may we escape from woe as from<br> a prison.</p>
