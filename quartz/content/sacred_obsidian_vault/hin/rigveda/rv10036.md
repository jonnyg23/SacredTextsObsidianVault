 <p>1. THERE are the Dawn and Night, the grand and beauteous Pair, Earth, Heaven, and Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman.<br> Indra I call, the Maruts, Mountains, and the Floods, Ādityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, and the Sky.<br> 2 May Dyaus and Prthivi, wise, true to Holy Law, keep us in safety from distress and injury.<br> Let not malignant Nirrti rule over us. We crave to-day this gracious favour of the Gods.<br> 3 Mother of Mitra and of opulent Varuṇa, may Aditi preserve us safe from all distress.<br> May we obtain the light of heaven without a foe. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 4 May ringing press-stones keep the Rākṣasas afar, ill dream, and Nirrti, and each voracious fiend.<br> May the Ādityas and the Maruts shelter us. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 5 Full flow libations; on our grass let Indra sit; Bṛhaspati the singer laud with Sāma hymns!<br> Wise be our hearts' imaginings that we may live. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 6 Ye Aśvins, make our sacrifice ascend to heaven, and animate the rite that it may send us bliss,<br> Offered with holy oil, with forward-speeding rein. We crave the gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 7 Hither I call the band of Maruts, swift to hear, great, purifying, bringing bliss, to he our Friends.<br> May we increase our wealth to glorify our name. We crave this graciousfavour of the Gods to-day.<br> 8 We bring the Stay of Life, who makes the waters swell, swift-hearing, Friend of Gods, who waits on sacrifice.<br> May we control that Power, Soma whose rays are bright. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 9 Alive ourselves, with living sons, devoid of guilt, may we win this with winners by fair means to win.<br> Let the prayer-haters bear our sin to every side. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 10 Hear us, O ye who claim the worship of mankind, and give us, O ye Gods, the gift for which we pray,<br> Victorious wisdom, fame with heroes and with wealth. We crave to-day this gracious favour of the Gods.<br> 11 We crave the gracious favour of the Gods to-day, great favour of great Gods, sublime and free from foes,<br> That we may gain rich treasure sprung from hero sons. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 12 In great enkindled Agni's keeping, and, for bliss, free from all sin before Mitra and Varuṇa.<br> May we share Savitar's best animating help. We crave this gracious favour of the Gods to-day.<br> 13 All ye, the Gods whom Savitar the Father of truth, and Varuṇa and Mitra govern,<br> Give us prosperity with hero children, and opulence in kine and various treasure.<br> 14 Savitar, Savitar from cast and westward, Savitar, Savitar from north and southward,<br> Savitar send us perfect health and comfort, Savitar let our days of life be lengthened!</p>
