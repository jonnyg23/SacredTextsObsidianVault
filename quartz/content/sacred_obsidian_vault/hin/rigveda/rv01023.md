 <p>1 STRONG are the Somas; come thou nigh; these juices have been mixt with milk:<br> Drink, Vāyu, the presented draughts.<br> 2 Both Deities who touch the heaven, Indra and Vāyu we invoke<br> To drink of this our Soma juice.<br> 3 The singers' for their aid, invoke Indra and Vāyu, swift as mind,<br> The thousand-eyed, the Lords of thought.<br> 4 Mitra and Varuṇa, renowned as Gods of consecrated might,<br> We call to drink the Soma juice.<br> 5 Those who by Law uphold the Law, Lords of the shining light of Law,<br> Mitra I call, and Varuṇa.<br> 6 Let Varuṇa be our chief defence, let Mitra guard us with all aids<br> Both make us rich exceedingly.<br> 7 Indra, by Maruts girt, we call to drink the Soma juice: may he<br> Sate him in union with his troop.<br> 8 Gods, Marut hosts whom Indra leads, distributers of Pūṣan's gifts,<br> Hearken ye all unto my cry.<br> 9 With conquering Indra for ally, strike Vṛtra down, ye bounteous Gods<br> Let not the wicked master us.<br> 10 We call the Universal Gods, and Maruts to the Soma draught,<br> For passing strong are Pṛśni's Sons.<br> 11 Fierce comes the Maruts thundering voice, like that of conquerors, when ye go<br> Forward to victory, O Men.<br> 12 Born of the laughing lightning. may the Maruts guard us everywhere<br> May they be gracious unto Us.<br> 13 Like some lost animal, drive to us, bright Pūṣan, him who bears up heaven,<br> Resting on many-coloured grass.<br> 14 Pūṣan the Bright has found the King, concealed and hidden in a cave,<br> Who rests on grass of many hues.<br> 15 And may he. duly bring to me the six bound closely, through these drops,<br> As one who ploughs with steers brings corn.<br> 16 Along their paths the Mothers go, Sisters of priestly ministrants,<br> Mingling their sweetness with the milk.<br> 17 May Waters gathered near the Sun, and those wherewith the Sun is joined,<br> Speed forth this sacrifice of ours.<br> 18 I call the Waters, Goddesses, wherein our cattle quench their thirst;<br> Oblations to the Streams be given.<br> 19 Amrit is in the Waters in the Waters there is healing balm<br> Be swift, ye Gods, to give them praise.<br> 20 Within the WatersSoma thus hath told medwell all balms that heal,<br> And Agni, he who blesseth all. The Waters hold all medicines.<br> 21 O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm,<br> So that I long may see the Sun.<br> 22 Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought.<br> If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me.<br> 23 The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come:<br> O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.<br> 24 Fill me with splendour, Agni; give offspring and length of days; the Gods<br> Shall know me even as I am, and Indra with the Ṛṣis, know.</p>
