 <p>1. WITH lauds at break of morn the priest invoketh Agni, Dawn, Dadhikrās, and both the Aśvins.<br> With one consent the Gods whose light is splendid, longing to taste our sacrifice, shall hear us.<br> 2 Three are thy powers, O Agni, three thy stations, three are thy tongues, yea, many, Child of Order!<br> Three bodies hast thou which the Gods delight in: with these protect our hymns with care unceasing.<br> 3 O Agni, many are the names thou bearest, immortal, God, Divine, and Jātavedas.<br> And many charms of charmers, All-Inspirer! have they laid in thee, Lord of true attendants!<br> 4 Agni, like Bhaga, leads the godly people, he who is true to Law and guards the seasons.<br> Ancient, all-knowing, he the Vṛtra-slayer shall bear the singer safe through every trouble.<br> 5 I call on Savitar the God, on Morning, Bṛhaspati, and Dadhikrās, and Agni,<br> On Varuṇa and Mitra, on the Aśvins, Bhaga, the Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas.</p>
