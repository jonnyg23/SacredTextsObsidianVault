 <p>1. WITH all her eyes the Goddess Night looks forth approaching many a spot:<br> She hath put all her glories on.<br> 2 Immortal. she hath filled the waste, the Goddess hath filled height and depth:<br> She conquers darkness with her light.<br> 3 The Goddess as she comes hath set the Dawn her Sister in her place:<br> And then the darkness vanishes.<br> 4 So favour us this night, O thou whose pathways we have visited<br> As birds their nest upon the tree.<br> 5 The villagers have sought their homes, and all that walks and all that flies,<br> Even the falcons fain for prey.<br> 6 Keep off the she-wolf and the wolf, O Urmya, keep the thief away;<br> Easy be thou for us to pass.<br> 7 Clearly hath she come nigh to me who decks the dark with richest hues:<br> O Morning, cancel it like debts.<br> 8 These have I brought to thee like kine. O Night, thou Child of Heaven, accept<br> This laud as for a conqueror.</p>
