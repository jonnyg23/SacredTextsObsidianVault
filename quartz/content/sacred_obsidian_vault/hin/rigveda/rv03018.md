 <p>1. AGNI, be kind to us when we approach thee good as a friend to friend, as sire and mother.<br> The races of mankind are great oppressors burn up malignity that strives against us.<br> 2 Agni, burn up the unfriendly who are near us, burn thou the foeman's curse who pays no worship.<br> Burn, Vasu, thou who markest well, the foolish: let thine eternal nimble beams surround thee.<br> 3 With fuel, Agni, and with oil, desirous, mine offering I present for strength and conquest,<br> With prayer, so far as I have power, adoring-this hymn divine to gain a hundred treasures.<br> 4 Give with thy glow, thou Son of Strength, when lauded, great vital power to those who toil to serve thee.<br> Give richly, Agni, to the Viśvāmitras in rest and stir. Oft have we decked thy body.<br> 5 Give us, O liberal Lord, great store of riches, for, Agni, such art thou when duly kindled.<br> Thou in the happy singer's home bestowest, amply with arms extended, things of beauty.</p>
