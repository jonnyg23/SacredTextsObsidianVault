 <p>1. COME to the juice that we have pressed, to Soma, Indra, bleat with milk:<br> Come, favouring us, thy Bay-drawn car!<br> 2 Come, Indra, to this gladdening drink, placed on the grass, pressed out with stones:<br> Wilt thou not drink thy fill thereof?<br> 3 To Indra have my songs of praise gone forth, thus rapidly sent hence,<br> To turn him to the Soma-draught.<br> 4 Hither with songs of praise we call Indra to drink the Soma juice:<br> Will he not come to us by lauds?<br> 5 Indra, these Somas are expressed. Take them within thy belly, Lord<br> Of Hundred Powers, thou Prince of Wealth.<br> 6 We know thee winner of the spoil, and resolute in battles, Sage!<br> Therefore thy blessing we implore.<br> 7 Borne hither by thy Stallions, drink, Indra, this juice which we have pressed,<br> Mingled with barley and with milk.<br> 8 Indra, for thee, in thine own place, I urge the Soma for thy draught:<br> Deep in thy heart let it remain,<br> 9 We call on thee, the Ancient One, Indra, to drink the Soma juice,<br> We Kuśikas who seek thine aid.</p>
