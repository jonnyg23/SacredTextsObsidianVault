 <p>1. Ye by your hymns are like high-thoughted singers, skilful, inviting Gods with sacrifices;<br> Fair to behold, like Kings, with bright adornment, like spotless gallants, leaders of the people:<br> 2 Like fire with flashing flame, breast-bound with chains of gold, like tempest-blasts, self-moving, swift to lend your aid;<br> As best of all foreknowers, excellent to guide, like Somas, good to guard the man who follows Law.<br> 3 Shakers of all, like gales of wind they travel, like tongues of burning fires in their effulgence.<br> Mighty are they as warriors clad in armour, and, like the Fathers' prayers, Most Bounteous Givers.<br> 4 Like spokes of car-wheels in one nave united, ever victorious like heavenly Heroes,<br> Shedding their precious balm like youthful suitors, they raise their voice and chant their psalm as singers.<br> 5 They who are fleet to travel like the noblest steeds, long to obtain the prize like bounteous charioteers,<br> Like waters speeding on with their precipitous floods, like omniform Aṅgirases with Sāma-hymns.<br> 6 Born from the stream, like press-stones are the Princes, for ever like the stones that crush in pieces;<br> Sons of a beauteous Dame, like playful children, like a great host upon the march with splendour.<br> 7 Like rays of Dawn, the visitors of sacrifice, they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright.<br> Like rivers hasting on, glittering with their spears, from far away they measure out the distances.<br> 8 Gods, send us happiness and make us wealthy, letting us singers prosper, O ye Maruts.<br> Bethink you of our praise and of our friendship: ye from of old have riches to vouchsafe us.</p>
