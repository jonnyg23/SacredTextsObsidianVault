 <p>1. COME, O Nāsatyas, on your car resplendent, rich in abundant wealth of kine and horses.<br> As harnessed steeds, all our laudations follow you whose forms shine with most delightful beauty.<br> 2 Come with the Gods associate, come ye hither to us, Nāsatyas, with your car accordant.<br> 'Twixt you and us there is ancestral friendship and common kin: remember and regard it.<br> 3 Awakened are the songs that praise the Aśvins, the kindred prayers and the Celestial Mornings.<br> Inviting those we long for, Earth and Heaven, the singer calleth these Nāsatyas hither.<br> 4 What time the Dawns break forth in light, O Aśvins, to you the poets offer their devotions.<br> God Savitar hath sent aloft his splendour, and fires sing praises with the kindled fuel.<br> 5 Come from the west, come from the cast, Nāsatyas, come, Aśvins, from below and from above us.<br> Bring wealth from all sides for the Fivefold People. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
