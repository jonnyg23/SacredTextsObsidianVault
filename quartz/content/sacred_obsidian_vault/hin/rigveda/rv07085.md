 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LXXXV. Indra-Varuṇa.</h3>  
 <p>1. FOR you I deck a harmless hymn, presenting the Soma juice to Varuṇa and Indra-<br> A hymn that shines like heavenly Dawn with fatness. May they be near us on the march and guard us.<br> 2 Here where the arrows fall amid the banners both hosts invoke the Gods in emulation.<br> O Indra-Varuṇa, smite back those-our foemen,yea, smite them withyour shaft to every quarter.<br> 3 Self-lucid in their seats, een heavenly Waters endowed with Godhead Varuṇa and Indra.<br> One of these holds the folk distinct and sundered, the Other smites and slays resistless foemen.<br> 4 Wise be the priest and skilled in Law Eternal, who with his sacred gifts and oration.<br> Brings you to aid us with your might, Ādityas: let him have viands to promote his welfare.<br> 5 May this my song reach Varuṇa and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me sons and offspring.<br> To the Gods banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods with blessings.</p>
