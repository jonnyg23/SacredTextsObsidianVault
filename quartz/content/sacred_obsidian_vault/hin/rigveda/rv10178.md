 <p>1. THIS very mighty one whom Gods commission, the Conqueror of cars, ever triumphant,<br> Swift, fleet to battle, with uninjured fellies, even Tārkṣya for our weal will we call hither.<br> 2 As though we offered up our gifts to Indra, may we ascend. him as a ship. for safety.<br> Like the two wide worlds, broad, deep far-extended, may we be safe both when he comes and leaves you.<br> 3 He who with might the Five Lands hath pervaded, like Sūrya with his lustre, and the waters<br> His strength wins hundreds, thousands none avert it, as the young maid repelleth not her lover.</p>
