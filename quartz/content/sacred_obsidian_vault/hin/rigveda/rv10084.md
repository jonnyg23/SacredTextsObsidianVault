 <p>1. BORNE on with thee, O Manyu girt by Maruts, let our brave men, impetuous, bursting forward,<br> March on, like flames of fire in form, exulting, with pointed arrows, sharpening their weapons.<br> 2 Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army's leader.<br> Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us.<br> 3 O Manyu, overcome thou our assailant on! breaking, slaying, crushing down the foemen.<br> They have not hindered thine impetuous vigour: Mighty, Sole born! thou makest them thy subjects.<br> 4 Alone or many thou art worshipped, Manyu: sharpen the spirit of each clan for battle.<br> With thee to aid, O thou of perfect splendour, we will uplift the glorious shout for conquest.<br> 5 Unyielding bringing victory like Indra, O Manyu, be thou here our Sovran Ruler.<br> To thy dear name, O Victor, we sing praises: we know the spring from which thou art come hither.<br> 6 Twin-born with power, destructive bolt of thunder, the highest conquering might is thine, Subduer!<br> Be friendly to its in thy spirit, Manyu, O Much-invoked, in shock of mighty battle.<br> 7 For spoil let Varuṇa and Manyu give us the wealth of both sides gathered and collected;<br> And let our enemies with stricken spirits, oerwhelmed with terror, slink away defeated.</p>
