 <p>1. FROM out the earth I dig this plant, a herb of most effectual power,<br> Wherewith one quells the rival wife and gains the husband for oneself.<br> 2 Auspicious, with expanded leaves, sent by the Gods, victorious plant,<br> Blow thou the rival wife away, and make my husband only mine.<br> 3 Stronger am 1, O Stronger One, yea, mightier than the mightier;<br> And she who is my rival wife is lower than the lowest dames.<br> 4 Her very name I utter not: she takes no pleasure in this man.<br> Far into distance most remote drive we the rival wife away.<br> 5 I am the conqueror, and thou, thou also act victorious:<br> As victory attends us both we will subdue my fellow-wife.<br> 6 I have gained thee for vanquisher, have grasped thee with a stronger spell.<br> As a cow hastens to her calf, so let thy spirit speed te me, hasten like water on its way.</p>
