 <p>1. ON flows the potent juice, sustainer of the heavens, the strength of Gods, whom men must hail with shouts of joy.<br> The Gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, impetuously winneth splendour in the streams.<br> 2 He takes his weapons, like a hero, in his hands, fain to win light, car-borne, in forays for the kine.<br> Indu, while stimulating India's might, is urged forward and balmed by sages skilful in their task.<br> 3 Soma, as thou art purified with flowing wave, exhibiting thy strength enter thou Indra's throat.<br> Make both worlds stream for us, as lightning doth the clouds: mete out exhaustless powers for us, as twere through song.<br> 4 Onward he flows, the King of all that sees the light: the Ṛṣis Lord hath raised the song of sacrifice;<br> Even he who is adorned with Sūrya's arrowy beam, Father of hymns, whose wisdom is beyond our reach.<br> 5 Like as a bull to herds, thou flowest to the pail, bellowing as a steer upon the water's lap.<br> So, best of Cheerers, thou for Indra flowest on that we, with thy protection, may oercome in fight.</p>
