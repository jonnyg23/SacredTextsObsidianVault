 <p>1. YE Gods, raise up once more the man whom ye have humbled and brought low.<br> O Gods, restore to life again the man who hatb committed sin.<br> 2 Two several winds are blowing here, from Sindhu, from a distant land.<br> May one breathe energy to thee, the other blow disease away.<br> 3 Hither, O Wind, blow healing balm, blow all disease away, thou Wind;<br> For thou who hast all medicine comest as envoy of the Gods.<br> 4 I am come nigh to thee with balms to give thee rest and keep thee safe.<br> I bring thee blessed strength, I drive thy weakening malady away.<br> 5 Here let the Gods deliver him, the Maruts band deliver him:<br> All things that be deliver him that he be freed from his disease.<br> 6 The Waters have their healing power, the Waters drive disease away.<br> The Waters have a balm for all: let them make medicine for thee.<br> 7 The tongue that leads the voice precedes. Then with our ten-fold branching hands,<br> With these two chasers of disease we stroke thee with a gentle touch.</p>
