 <p>1. ONE-MINDED, wise, they tracked thee like a thief lurking in dark cave with a stolen cow:<br> Thee claiming worship, bearing it to Gods: there nigh to thee sate all the Holy Ones.<br> 2 The Gods approached the ways of holy Law; there was a gathering vast as heaven itself.<br> The waters feed with praise the growing Babe, born nobly in the womb, the seat of Law.<br> 3 Like grateful food, like some wide dwelling place, like a fruit-bearing hill, a wholesome stream.<br> Like a steed urged to run in swift career, rushing like Sindhu, who may check his course?<br> 4 Kin as a brother to his sister floods, he eats the woods as a King eats the rich.<br> When through the forest, urged by wind, he spreads, verily Agni shears the hair of earth.<br> 5 Like a swan sitting in the floods he pants wisest in mind mid men he wakes at morn.<br> A Sage like Soma, sprung from Law, he grew like some young creature, mighty, shining far.</p>
