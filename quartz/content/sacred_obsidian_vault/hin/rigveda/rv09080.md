 <p>1. ON flows the stream of Soma who beholds mankind: by everlasting Law he calls the Gods from heaven.<br> He lightens with the roaring of Br aspati: h the lakes have not contained the pourings of juice.<br> 2 Thou, powerful Soma, thou to whom the cows have -lowed, ascendest bright with sheen, thine iron-fashioned home.<br> Thou, lengthening our princes' life and high renown, flowest for Indra as his might to gladdening drink.<br> 3 Best giver of delight, he flows to Indra's throat, robing himself in might, Auspicious One, for fame.<br> He spreads himself abroad to meet all things that be: the vigorous Tawny Steed flows sporting on his way.<br> 4 The men, the ten swift fingers, milk thee out for Gods, even thee most rich in meath, with thousand flowing streams.<br> Soma who winnest thousands, driven by the men, expressed with stones, bring, as thou flowest, all the Gods.<br> 5 Deft-handed men with stones, the ten swift fingers, drain thee into waters, thee, the Steer enriched with sweets.<br> Thou, Soma, gladdening Indra, and the Heavenly Host, flowest as Pavamana like a river's wave.</p>
