 <p>1. COME, we have pressed the juice for thee; O Indra, drink this Soma here<br> Sit thou on this my sacred grass.<br> 2 O Indra, let thy long-maned Bays, yoked by prayer, bring thee hitherward<br> Give car and listen to our prayers.<br> 3 We Soma-bearing Brahmans call thee Soma-drinker with thy friend,<br> We, Indra, bringing Soma juice.<br> 4 Come unto us who bring the juice, come unto this our eulogy,<br> Fair-visored! drink thou of the juice.<br> 5 I pour it down within thee, so through all thy members let it spread:<br> Take with. thy tongue the pleasant drink.<br> 6 Sweet to thy body let it be, delicious be the savoury juice:<br> Sweet be the Soma to thine heart.<br> 7 Like women, let this Soma-draught, invested with its robe, approach,<br> O active Indra, close to thee.<br> 8 Indra, transported with the juice, vast in his bulk, strong in his neck<br> And stout arms, smites the Vṛtras down.<br> 9 O Indra, go thou forward, thou who rulest over all by might:<br> Thou Vṛtra-slayer slay the fiends,<br> 10 Long be thy grasping-hook wherewith thou givest ample wealth to him<br> Who sheds the juice and worships thee.<br> 11 Here, Indra, is thy Soma-draught, made pure upon the sacred grass:<br> Run hither, come and drink thereof.<br> 12 Famed for thy radiance, worshipped well this juice is shed for thy delight<br> Thou art invoked, Akhandala!<br> 13 To Kundapayya, grandson's son, grandson of Srngavrs! to thee,<br> To him have I addressed my thought.<br> 14 Strong pillar thou, Lord of the home armour of Soma-offerers:<br> The drop of Soma breaketh all the strongholds down, and Indra is the Ṛṣis Friend.<br> 15 Holy Prdikusanu, winner of the spoil, one eminent oer many men,<br> Lead on the wild horse Indra with his vigorous grasp forward to drink the Soma juice.</p>
