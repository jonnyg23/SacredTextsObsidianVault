 <p>1. WITH stones have we pressed out: O come; these gladdening drops are blent with milk, these Soma-drops which gladden you.<br> Come to us, Kings who reach to heaven, approach us, coming hitherward.<br> These milky drops are yours, Mitra and Varuṇa, bright Soma juices blent with milk.<br> 2 Here are the droppings; come ye nigh the Soma-droppings blent with curd, juices expressed and blent with curd.<br> Now for the wakening of your Dawn together with the Sun-God's rays,<br> juice waits for Mitra and for Varuṇa to drink, fair juice for drink, for sacrifice.<br> 3 As twere a radiant-coloured cow, they milk with stones the stalk for you, with stones they milk the Soma-plant.<br> May ye come nigh us, may ye turn hither to drink the Soma juice.<br> The men pressed out this juice, Mitra and Varuṇa, pressed out this Soma for your drink.</p>
