 <p>1. GUARDIANS of Order, ye whose Laws are ever true, in the sublimest heaven your chariot ye ascend.<br> O Mitra-Varuṇa whomsoeer ye: favour, here, to him the rain with sweetness streameth down from heaven.<br> 2 This world's imperial Kings, O Mitra-Varuṇa, ye rule in holy synod, looking on the light.<br> We pray for rain, your boon, and immortality. Through heaven and over earth the thunderers take their way.<br> 3 Imperial Kings, strong, Heroes, Lords of earth and heaven, Mitra and Varuṇa, ye ever active Ones,<br> Ye wait on thunder with the many-tinted clouds, and by the Asura's magic power cause Heaven to rain.<br> 4 Your magic, Mitra-Varuṇa, resteth in the heaven. The Sun, the wondrous weapon, cometh forth as light.<br> Ye hide him in the sky with cloud and flood of rain, and water-drops, Parjanya! full of sweetness flow.<br> 5 The Maruts yoke their easy car for victory, O Mitra-Varuṇa, as a hero in the wars.<br> The thunderers roam through regions varied in their hues. Imperial Kings, bedew us with the milk of heaven.<br> 6 Refreshing is your voice, O Mitra-Varuṇa: Parjanya sendeth out a wondrous mighty voice.<br> With magic power the Maruts clothe them with the clouds. Ye Two cause Heaven to rain, the red, the spotless One.<br> 7 Wise, with your Law and through the Asura's magic power ye guard the ordinances, Mitra-Varuṇa.<br> Ye by eternal Order govern all the world. Ye set the Sun in heaven as a refulgent car.</p>
