 <p>1. VARUNA cut a pathway out for Sūrya, and led the watery floods of rivers onward.<br> The Mares, as in a race, speed on in order. He made great channels for the days to follow.<br> 2 The wind, thy breath, hath sounded through the region like a wild beast that seeks his food in pastures.<br> Within these two, exalted Earth and Heaven, O Varuṇa, are all the forms thou lovest.<br> 3 Varuṇa's spies, sent forth upon their errand, survey the two world-halves well formed and fashioned.<br> Wise are they, holy, skilled in sacrifices, the furtherers of the praise-songs of the prudent.<br> 4 To me who understand hath Varuṇa spoken, the names borne by the Cow are three times seven.<br> The sapient God, knowing the place's secret, shall speak as twere to teach the race that cometh.<br> 5 On him three heavens rest and are supported, and the three earths are there in sixfold order.<br> The wise King Varuṇa hath made in heaven that Golden Swing to cover it with glory.<br> 6 Like Varuṇa from heaven he sinks in Sindhu, like a white-shining spark, a strong wild creature.<br> Ruling in depths and meting out the region, great saving power hath he, this world's Controller.<br> 7 Before this Varuṇa may we be sinless him who shows mercy even to the sinner-<br> While we are keeping Aditi's ordinances. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
