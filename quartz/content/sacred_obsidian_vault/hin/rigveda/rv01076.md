 <p>1. How may the mind draw nigh to please thee, Agni? What hymn of praise shall bring us greatest blessing?<br> Or who hath gained thy power by sacrifices? or with what mind shall we bring thee oblations?<br> 2 Come hither, Agni; sit thee down as Hotar; be thou who never wast deceived our leader.<br> May Heaven and Earth, the all-pervading, love thee: worship the Gods to win for us their favour.<br> 3 Burn thou up all the Rākṣasas, O Agni; ward thou off curses from our sacrifices.<br> Bring hither with his Bays the Lord of Soma: here is glad welcome for the Bounteous Giver.<br> 4 Thou Priest with lip and voice that bring us children hast been invoked. Here with the Gods be seated.<br> Thine is the task of Cleanser and Presenter: waken us, Wealth-bestower and Producer.<br> 5 As with oblations of the priestly Manus thou worshippedst the Gods, a Sage with sages,<br> So now, O truthfullest Invoker Agni, worship this day with joy-bestowing ladle.</p>
