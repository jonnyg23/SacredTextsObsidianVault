 <p>1. INDRA and Viṣṇu, at my task's completion I urge you on with food and sacred service.<br> Accept the sacrifice and grant us riches, leading us on by unobstructed pathways.<br> 2 Ye who inspire all hymns, Indra and Viṣṇu, ye vessels who contain the Soma juices,<br> May hymns of praise that now are sung address you, the lauds that are recited by the singers.<br> 3 Lords of joy-giving draughts, Indra and Viṣṇu, come, giving gifts of treasure, to the Soma.<br> With brilliant rays of hymns let chanted praises, repeated with the lauds, adorn and deck you.<br> 4 May your foe-conquering horses bring you hither, Indra and Viṣṇu, sharers of the banquet.<br> Of all our hymns accept the invocations list to my prayers and hear the songs I sing you.<br> 5 This your deed, Indra-Viṣṇu, must be lauded: widely ye strode in the wild joy of Soma.<br> Ye made the firmament of larger compass, and made the regions broad for our existence.<br> 6 Strengthened with sacred offerings, IndraViṣṇu, first eaters, served with worship ana oblation,<br> Fed with the holy oil, vouchsafe us riches ye are the lake, the vat that holds the Soma.<br> 7 Drink of this meath, O Indra, thou, and Viṣṇu; drink ye your fill of Soma, Wonder-Workers.<br> The sweet exhilarating juice hath reached you. Hear ye my prayers, give ear unto my calling.<br> 8 Ye Twain have conquered, neer have yc been conquered: never hath either of the Twain been vanquished.<br> Ye, Indra-Viṣṇu, when ye fought the battle, produced this infinite with three divisions.</p>
