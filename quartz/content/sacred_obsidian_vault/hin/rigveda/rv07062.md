 <p>1. SURYA hath sent aloft his beams of splendour oer all the tribes of men in countless places.<br> Together with the heaven he shines apparent, formed by his Makers well with power and wisdom.<br> 2 So hast thou mounted up before us, Sūrya, through these our praises, with fleet dappled horses.<br> Declare us free from all offence to Mitra, and Varuṇa, and Aryaman, and Agni.<br> 3 May holy Agni, Varuṇa, and Mitra send down their riches upon us in thousands.<br> May they, the Bright Ones, make our praise-song perfect, and, when we laud them, grant us all our wishes.<br> 4 O undivided Heaven and Earth, preserve us, us, Lofty Ones! your nobIy-born descendants.<br> Let us not anger Varuṇa, nor Vāyu, nor him, the dearest Friend of mortals, Mitra.<br> 5 Stretch forth your arms and let our lives be lengthened: with fatness dew the pastures of our cattle.<br> Ye Youthful, make us famed among the people: hear, Mitra-Varuṇa, these mine invocations.<br> 6 Now Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and for our children.<br> May we find paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
