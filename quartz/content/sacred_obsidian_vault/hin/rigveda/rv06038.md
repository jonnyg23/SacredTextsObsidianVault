 <p>1. HE hath drunk hence, Most Marvellous, and carried away our great and splendid call on Indra.<br> The Bounteous, when we serve the Gods, accepteth song yet more famous and the gifts we bring him.<br> 2 The speaker filleth with a cry to Indra his ears who cometh nigh een from a distance.<br> May this my call bring Indra to my presence, this call to Gods composed in sacred verses.<br> 3 Him have I sung with my best song and praises, Indra of ancient birth and Everlasting.<br> For prayer and songs in him are concentrated: let laud wax mighty when addressed to Indra:<br> 4 Indra, whom sacrifice shall strengthen, Soma, and song and hymn, and praises and devotion,<br> Whom Dawns shall strengthen when the night departeth, Indra whom days shall strengthen, months, and autumns.<br> 5 Him, born for conquering might in full perfection, and waxen strongfor bounty and for glory,<br> Great, Powerful, will we to-day, O singer, invite to aid. us and to quell our foemen.</p>
