 <p>1. THE urgings of the people have impelled me, and by,the nearest way I bring you Pūṣan.<br> The Universal Gods have brought me safely. The cry was heard, Behold, Dubsasu cometh!<br> 2 The ribs that compass me give pain and trouble me like rival wives.<br> Indigence, nakedness, exhaustion press me sore: my mind is fluttering like a bird's.<br> 3 As rats eat weavers' threads, cares are consuming me, thy singer, gatakratu, me.<br> Have mercy on us once, O Indra, Bounteous Lord: be thou a Father unto us.<br> 4 I the priests' Ṛṣi chose as prince most liberal Kurusravana,<br> The son of Trasadasyu's son,<br> 5 Whose three bays harnessed to the car bear me straight onward: I will laud<br> The giver of a thousand meeds,<br> 6 The sire of Upamasravas, even him whose words were passing sweet,<br> As a fair field is to its lord.<br> 7 Mark, Upamasravas, his son, mark, grandson of Mitratithi:<br> I am thy father's eulogist.<br> 8 If I controlled Immortal Gods, yea, even were I Lord of men,<br> My liberal prince were living still.<br> 9 None lives, even had he hundred lives, beyond the statute of the Gods<br> So am I parted from my friend.</p>
