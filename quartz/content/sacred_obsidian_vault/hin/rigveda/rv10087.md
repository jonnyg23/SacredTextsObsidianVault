 <p>1. I BALM with oil the mighty Rakṣas-slayer; to the most famous Friend I come for shelter<br> Enkindled, sharpened by our rites, may Agni protect us in the day and night from evil.<br> 2 O Jātavedas with the teeth of iron, enkindled with thy flame attack the demons.<br> Seize with thy longue the foolish gods' adorers: rend, put within thy mouth the raw-flesh caters.<br> 3 Apply thy teeth, the upper and the lower, thou who hast both, enkindled and destroying.<br> Roam also in the air, O King, around us, and with thy jaws assail the wicked spirits.<br> 4 Bending thy shafts through sacrifices, Agni, whetting their points with song as if with whetstones,<br> Pierce to the heart therewith the Yātudhānas, and break their arms uplifed to attack thee.<br> 5 Pierce through the Yātudhāna's skin, O Agni; let the destroying dart with fire consume him.<br> Rend his joints, Jātavedas, let the cater of flesh, flesh-seeking, track his mangled body.<br> 6 Where now thou seest Agni Jātavedas, one of these demons standing still or roaming,<br> Or flying on those paths in air's midregion, sharpen the shaft and as an archer pierce him.<br> 7 Tear from the evil spirit, Jātavedas, what he hath seized and with his spears hath captured.<br> Blazing before him strike him down, O Agni; let spotted carrion-eating kites devour him.<br> 8 Here tell this forth, O Agni: whosoever is, he himself, or acteth as, a demon,<br> Him grasp, O thou Most Youthful, with thy fuel. to the Mati-seer's eye give him as booty.<br> 9 With keen glance guard the sacrifice, O Agni: thou Sage, conduct it onward to the Vasus.<br> Let not the fiends, O Man-beholder, harm thee burning against the Rākṣasas to slay them.<br> 10 Look on the fiend mid men, as Man-beholder: rend thou his three extremities in pieces.<br> Demolish with thy flame his ribs, O Agni, the Yātudhāna's root destroy thou triply.<br> 11 Thrice, Agni, let thy noose surround the demon who with his falsehood injures Holy Order.<br> Loud roaring with thy flame, O Jātavedas, crush him and cast him down before the singer.<br> 12 Lead thou the worshipper that eye, O Agni, wherewith thou lookest on the hoof-armed demon.<br> With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the foot who ruins truth with falsehood.<br> 13 Agni, what curse the pair this day have uttered, what heated word the worshippers have spoken,<br> Each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spirit,pierce to the heart therewith the Yātudhānas.<br> 14 With fervent heat exterminate the demons; destroy the fiends with burning flame, O Agni.<br> Destroy with fire the foolish gods' adorers; blaze and destrepy the insatiable monsters.<br> 15 May Gods destroy this day the evil-doer may each hot curse of his return and blast him.<br> Let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals, and Visva's net enclose the Yātudhāna.<br> 16 The fiend who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of horses and of human bodies,<br> Who steals the milch-cow's milk away, O Agni,tear off the heads of such with fiery fury.<br> 17 The cow gives milk each year, O Man-regarder: let not the Yātudhāna ever taste it.<br> If one would glut him with the biesting, Agni, pierce with thy flame his vitals as he meets thee.<br> 18 Let the fiends drink the poison of the cattle; may Aditi cast off the evildoers.<br> May the God Savitar give them up to ruin, and be their share of plants and herbs denied them.<br> 19 Agni, from days of old thou slayest demons: never shall Rākṣasas in fight oercome thee.<br> Burn up the foolish ones, the flesh-devourers: let none of them escape thine heavenly arrow.<br> 20 Guard us, O Agni, from above and under, protect us fl-om behind us and before us;<br> And may thy flames, most fierce and never wasting, glowing with fervent heat, consume the sinner.<br> 21 From rear, from front, from under, from above us, O King, protect us as a Sage with wisdom.<br> Guard to old age thy friend, O Friend, Eternal: O Agni, as Immortal, guard us mortals.<br> 22 We set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni, thee a Sage,<br> Of hero lineage, day by day, destroyer of our treacherous foes.<br> 23 Burn with thy poison turned against the treacherous brood of Rākṣasas,<br> O Agni, with thy sharpened glow, with lances armed with points of flame.<br> 24 Burn thou the paired Kimīdins, brun, Agni, the Yātudhāna pairs.<br> I sharpen thee, Infallible, with hymns. O Sage, be vigilant.<br> 25 Shoot forth, O Agni, with thy flame demolish them on every side.<br> Break thou the Yātudhāna's strength, the vigour of the Rākṣasa.</p>
