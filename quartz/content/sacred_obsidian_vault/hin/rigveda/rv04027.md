 <p>1. I, As I lay within the womb, considered all generations of these Gods in order.<br> A hundred iron fortresses confined me but forth I flew with rapid speed a Falcon.<br> 2 Not at his own free pleasure did he bear me: he conquered with his strength and manly courage.<br> Straightway the Bold One left the fiends behind him and passed the winds as he grew yet more mighty.<br> 3 When with loud cry from heaven down sped the Falcon, thence hasting like the wind he bore the Bold One.<br> Then, wildly raging in his mind, the archer Kṛśānu aimed and loosed the string to strike him.<br> 4 The Falcon bore him from heaven's lofty summit as the swift car of Indra's Friend bore Bhujyu.<br> Then downward hither fell a flying feather of the Bird hasting forward in his journey.<br> 5 And now let Maghavan accept the beaker, white, filled with milk, filled with the shining liquid;<br> The best of sweet meath which the priests have offered: that Indra to his joy may drink, the Hero, that he may take and drink it to his rapture.</p>
