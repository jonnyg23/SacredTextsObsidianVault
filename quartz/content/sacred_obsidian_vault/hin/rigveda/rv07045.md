 <p>1. MAY the God Savitar, rich in goodly treasures, filling the region, borne by steeds, come hither,<br> In his hand holding much that makes men happy, lulling to slumber and arousing creatures.<br> 2 Golden, sublime, and easy in their motion, his arms extend unto the bounds of heaven.<br> Now shall that mightiness of his he lauded: even Sūrya yields to him in active vigour.<br> 3 May this God Savitar, the Strong and Mighty, the Lord of precious wealth, vouchsafe us treasures.<br> May he, advancing his far-spreading lustre, bestow on us the food that feedeth mortals.<br> 4 These songs praise Savitar whose tongue is pleasant, praise him whose arms are full, whose hands are lovely.<br> High vital strength, and manifold, may he grant us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
