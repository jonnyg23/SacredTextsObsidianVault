 <p>1. THE three times seven Milch-kine in the eastern heaven have for this Soma poured the genuine milky draught.<br> Four other beauteous Creatures hath he made for his adornment, when he waxed in strength through holy rites.<br> 2 Longing for lovely Amṛta, by his wisdom he divided, each apart from other, earth and heaven.<br> He gladly wrapped himself in the most lucid floods, when through their glory they found the God's resting-place.<br> 3 May those his brilliant rays he ever free from death, inviolate, for both classes of created things,<br> Rays wherewith powers of men and Gods are purified. Yea, even for this have sageswelcomed him as King.<br> 4 He, while he is adorned by the ten skilful ones, that he too in the Midmost Mothers may create,<br> While he is watching oer the lovely Amṛta's ways, looks on both races as Beholder of mankind.<br> 5 He, while he is adorned to stream forth mighty strength, rejoices in his place between the earth and heaven.<br> The Steer dispels the evil-hearted with his might, aiming at offerings as an archer at the game.<br> 6 Beholding, as it were, Two Mother Cows, the Steer goes roaring on his way even as the Maruts roar.<br> Knowing Eternal Law, the earliest light of heaven, he, passing wise, was chosen out to tell it forth.<br> 7 The fearful Bull is bellowing with violent might, far-sighted, sharpening his yellowcoloured horns.<br> Soma assumes his seat in the well-fashioned place: the cowhide and the sheepskin are his ornament.<br> 8 Bright, making pure his body free from spot and stain, on the sheep's back the Golden-coloured hath flowed down.<br> Acceptable to Mitra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, he is prepared as threefold meal by skilful men.<br> 9 Flow on for the God's banquet, Soma, as a Steer, and enter Indra's heart, the Soma's reservoir.<br> Bear us beyond misfortune ere we be oppres. sed. the man who knows the land directs the man who asks.<br> 10 Urged like a car-steed flow to strength, O Soma: Indu, flow onward to the throat of Indra.<br> Skilled, bear us past, as in a boat oer water: as battling Hero save us from the foeman.</p>
