 <p>1. To Indra Dyaus the Asura hath bowed him down, to Indra mighty Earth with wide-extending tracts, to win the light, with wide-spread tracts.<br> All Gods of one accord have set Indra in front preeminent.<br> For Indra all libations must be set apart, all man's libations set apart.<br> 2 In all libations men with hero spirit urge the Universal One, each seeking several light, each fain to win the light apart.<br> Thee, furthering like a ship, will we set to the chariot-pole of strength,<br> As men who win with sacrifices Indra's thought, men who win Indra with their lauds.<br> 3 Couples desirous of thine aid are storming thee, pouring their presents forth to win a stall of kine, pouring gifts, Indra, seeking thee.<br> When two men seeking spoil or heaven thou bringest face to face in war,<br> Thou showest, Indra, then the bolt thy constant friend, the Bull that ever waits on thee.<br> 4 This thine heroic power men of old time have known, wherewith thou breakest down, Indra, autumnal forts, breakest them down with conquering might.<br> Thou hast chastised, O Indra, Lord of Strength, the man who worships not,<br> And made thine own this great earth and these water-floods; with joyous heart these <a href="errata.htm#4">water-floods</a>.<br> 5 And they have bruited far this hero-might when thou, O Strong One, in thy joy helpest thy suppliants, who sought to win thee for their Friend.<br> Their battle-cry thou madest sound victorious in the shocks of war.<br> One stream after another have they gained from thee, eager for glory have they gained.<br> 6. Also this morn may he be well inclined to us, mark at our call our offerings and our song of praise, our call that we may win the light.<br> As thou, O Indra Thunder-armed, wilt, as the Strong One, slay the foe,<br> Listen thou to the prayer of me a later sage, hear thou a later sage's prayer.<br> 7 O Indra, waxen strong and well-inclined to us, thou very mighty, slay the man that is our foe, slay the man, Hero! with thy bolt.<br> Slay thou the man who injures us: hear thou, as readiest, to hear.<br> Far be malignity, like mischief on the march, afar be all malignity.</p>
