 <p>1 DAWN on us with prosperity, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,<br> Dawn with great glory, Goddess, Lady of the Light, dawn thou with riches, Bounteous One.<br> 2 They, bringing steeds and kine, boon-givers of all wealth, have oft sped forth to lighten us.<br> O Uṣas, waken up for me the sounds of joy: send us the riches of the great.<br> 3 Uṣas hath dawned, and now shall dawn, the Goddess, driver forth of cars<br> Which, as she cometh nigh, have fixed their thought on her, like glory-seekers on the flood.<br> 4 Here Kaṇva, chief of Kaṇva's race, sings forth aloud the glories of the heroes names,<br> The. princes who, O Uṣas, as thou comest near, direct their thoughts to liberal gifts.<br> 5 Like a good matron Uṣas comes carefully tending everything:<br> Rousing all life she stirs all creatures that have feet, and makes the birds of air fly up.<br> 6 She sends the busy forth, each man to his pursuit: delay she knows not as she springs.<br> O rich in opulence, after thy dawning birds that have flown forth no longer rest.<br> 7 This Dawn hath yoked her steeds afar, beyond the rising of the Sun:<br> Borne on a hundred chariots she, auspicious Dawn, advances on her way to Men.<br> 8 To meet her glance all living creatures bend them down: Excellent One, she makes the light.<br> Uṣas, the Daughter of the Sky, the opulent, shines foes and enmities away.<br> 9 Shine on us with thy radiant light, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,<br> Bringing to us great store of high felicity, and beaming on our solemn rites.<br> 10 For in thee is each living creature's breath and life, when, Excellent! thou dawnest forth.<br> Borne on thy lofty car, O Lady of the Light, hear, thou of wondrous wealth, our call.<br> 11 O Uṣas, win thyself the strength which among men is wonderful.<br> Bring thou thereby the pious unto holy rites, those who as priests sing praise to thee.<br> 12 Bring from the firmament, O Uṣas, all the Gods, that they may drink our Soma juice,<br> And, being what thou art, vouchsafe us kine and steeds, strength meet for praise and hero might.<br> 13 May Uṣas whose auspicious rays are seen resplendent round about,<br> Grant us great riches, fair in form, of all good things, wealth which light labour may attain.<br> 14 Mighty One, whom the Ṛṣis of old time invoked for their protection and their help,<br> O Uṣas, graciously answer our songs of praise with bounty and with brilliant light.<br> 15 Uṣas, as thou with light to day hast opened the twin doors of heaven,<br> So grant thou us a dwelling wide and free from foes. O Goddess, give us food with kine.<br> 16 Bring us to wealth abundant, sent in every shape, to plentiful refreshing food,<br> To all-subduing splendour, Uṣas, Mighty One, to strength, thou rich in spoil and wealth.</p>
