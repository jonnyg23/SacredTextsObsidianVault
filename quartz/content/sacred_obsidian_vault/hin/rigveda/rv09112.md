 <p>1. WE all have various thoughts and plans, and diverse are the ways of men.<br> The Brahman seeks the worshipper, wright seeks the cracked, and leech the maimed. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 2 The smith with ripe and seasoned plants, with feathers of the birds of air,<br> With stones, and with enkindled flames, seeks him who hath a store of gold. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 3 A bard am I, my dad's a leech, mammy lays corn upon the stones.<br> Striving for wealth, with varied plans, we follow our desires like kine. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 4 The horse would draw an easy car, gay hosts attract the laugh and jest.<br> The male desires his mate's approach, the frog is eager for the flood, Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.</p>
