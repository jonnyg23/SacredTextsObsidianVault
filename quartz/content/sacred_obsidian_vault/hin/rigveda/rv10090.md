 <p>1. A THOUSAND heads hath Puruṣa, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.<br> On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.<br> 2 This Puruṣa is all that yet hath been and all that is to be;<br> The Lord of Immortality which waxes greater still by food.<br> 3 So mighty is his greatness; yea, greater than this is Puruṣa.<br> All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths eternal life in heaven.<br> 4 With three-fourths Puruṣa went up: one-fourth of him again was here.<br> Thence he strode out to every side over what cats not and what cats.<br> 5 From him Virāj was born; again Puruṣa from Virāj was born.<br> As soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward oer the earth.<br> 6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Puruṣa as their offering,<br> Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.<br> 7 They balmed as victim on the grass Puruṣa born in earliest time.<br> With him the Deities and all Sādhyas and Ṛṣis sacrificed.<br> 8 From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up.<br> He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame.<br> 9 From that great general sacrifice Ṛcas and Sāma-hymns were born:<br> Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus had its birth from it.<br> 10 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth:<br> From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born.<br> 11 When they divided Puruṣa how many portions did they make?<br> What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?<br> 12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made.<br> His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced.<br> 13 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth;<br> Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vāyu from his breath.<br> 14 Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head<br> Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.<br> 15 Seven fencing-sticks had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared,<br> When the Gods, offering sacrifice, bound, as their victim, Puruṣa.<br> 16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim these were the earliest holy ordinances.<br> The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sādhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.</p>
