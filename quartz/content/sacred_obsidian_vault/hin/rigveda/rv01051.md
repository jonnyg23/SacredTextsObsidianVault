 <p>1 MAKE glad with songs that Ram whom many men invoke, worthy of songs of praise, Indra, the sea of wealth;<br> Whose gracious deeds for men spread like the heavens abroad: sing praise to him the Sage, most liberal for our good.<br> 2 As aids the skilful Ṛbhus yearned to Indra strong to save, who fills mid-air, encompassed round with might,<br> Rushing in rapture; and oer Śatakratu came the gladdening shout that urged him on to victory.<br> 3 Thou hast disclosed the kine's stall for the Aṅgirases, and made a way for Atri by a hundred doors.<br> On Vimada thou hast bestowed both food and wealth, making thy bolt dance in the sacrificer's fight.<br> 4 Thou hast unclosed the prisons of the waters; thou hast in the mountain seized the treasure rich in gifts.<br> When thou hadst slain with might the dragon Vṛtra, thou, Indra, didst raise the Sun in heaven for all to see.<br> 5 With wondrous might thou blewest enchanter fiends away, with powers celestial those who called on thee in jest.<br> Thou, hero-hearted, hast broken down Pipru's forts, and helped Ṛjiśvan when the Dasyus were struck dead.<br> 6 Thou savedst Kutsa when Śuṣṇa was smitten down; to Atithigva gavest Śambara for a prey.<br> Een mighty Arbuda thou troddest under foot: thou from of old wast born to strike the Dasyus dead.<br> 7 All power and might is closely gathered up in thee; thy bounteous spirit joys in drinking Soma juice.<br> Known is the thunderbolt that lies within thine arms: rend off therewith all manly prowess of our foe.<br> 8 Discern thou well Āryas and Dasyus; punishing the lawless give them up to him whose grass is strewn.<br> Be thou the sacrificer's strong encourager all these thy deeds are my delight at festivals.<br> 9 Indra gives up the lawless to the pious man, destroying by the Strong Ones those who have no strength.<br> Vamra when glorified destroyed the gathered piles of the still waxing great one who would reach the heaven.<br> 10 The might which Uśanā hath formed for thee with might rends in its greatness and with strength both worlds apart.<br> O Hero-souled, the steeds of Vāta, yoked by thought, have carried thee to fame while thou art filled with power.<br> 11 When Indra hath rejoiced with Kāvya Uśanā, he mounts his steeds who swerve wider and wider yet.<br> The Strong hath loosed his bolt with the swift rush of rain, and he hath rent in pieces Śuṣṇa's firm-built forts.<br> 12 Thou mountest on thy car amid strong Soma draughts: Śāryāta brought thee those in which thou hast delight.<br> Indra, when thou art pleased with men whose Soma flows thou risest to unchallenged glory in the sky.<br> 13 To old Kakṣīvān, Soma-presser, skilled in song, O Indra, thou didst give the youthful Vṛcayā.<br> Thou, very wise, wast Menā, Vrsanśva's child: those deeds of thine must all be told at Soma feasts.<br> 14 The good man's refuge in his need is Indra, firm as a doorpost, praised among the Pajras.<br> Indra alone is Lord of wealth, the Giver, lover of riches, chariots, kine, and horses.<br> 15 To him the Mighty One, the self-resplendent, verily strong and great, this praise is uttered.<br> May we and all the heroes, with the princes, be, in this fray, O Indra, in thy keeping.</p>
