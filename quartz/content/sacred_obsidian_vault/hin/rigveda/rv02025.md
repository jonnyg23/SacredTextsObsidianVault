 <p>1. HE lighting up the flame shall conquer enemies: strong shall he be who offers prayer and brings his gift.<br> He with his seed spreads forth beyond another's seed, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.<br> 2 With heroes he shall overcome his hero foes, and spread his wealth by kine wise by himself is be.<br> His children and his children's children grow in strength, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.<br> 3 He, mighty like a raving river's billowy flood, as a bull conquers oxen, overcomes with strength.<br> Like Agni's blazing rush he may not be restrained, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.<br> 4 For him the floods of heaven flow never failing down: first with the heroes he goes forth to war for kine.<br> He slays in unabated vigour with great might, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.<br> 5 All roaring rivers pour their waters down for him, and many a flawless shelter hath been granted him.<br> Blest with the happiness of Gods he prospers well, whomever Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.</p>
