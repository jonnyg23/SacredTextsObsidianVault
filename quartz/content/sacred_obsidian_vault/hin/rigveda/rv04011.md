 <p>1. THY blessed majesty, victorious Agni, shines brightly in the neighbourhood of Sūrya.<br> Splendid to see, it shows even at nighttime, and food is fair to look on in thy beauty.<br> 2 Agni, disclose his thought for him who singeth, the well, Strong God! while thou art praised with fervour.<br> Vouchsafe to us that powerful hymn, O Mighty, which, Radiant One! with all the Gods thou lovest.<br> 3 From thee, O Agni, springs poetic wisdom, from thee come thoughts and hymns of praise that prosper;<br> From thee flows wealth, with heroes to adorn it, to the true-hearted man who gives oblation.<br> 4 From thee the hero springs who wins the booty, bringer of help, mighty, of real courage.<br> From thee comes wealth, sent by the Gods, bliss-giving; Agni, from thee the fleet impetuous charger.<br> 5 Immortal Agni, thee whose voice is pleasant, as first in rank, as God, religious mortals<br> Invite with hymns; thee who removest hatred, Friend of the Home, the household's Lord, unerring.<br> 6 Far from us thou removest want and sorrow, far from us all ill-will when thou protectest.<br> Son of Strength, Agni, blest is he at evening, whom thou as God attendest for his welfare.</p>
