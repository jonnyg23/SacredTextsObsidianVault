 <p>1. I WITH a holy heart that brings oblation will sing forth praise to meet your car, ye Princes,<br> Which, Much-desired! hath wakened as your envoy. I call you hither as a son his parents.<br> 2 Brightly hath Agni shone by us enkindled: the limits even of darkness were apparent.<br> Eastward is seen the Banner of the Morning, the Banner born to give Heaven's Daughter glory.<br> 3 With hymns the deft priest is about you, Aśvins, the eloquent priest attends you now, Nāsatyas.<br> Come by the paths that ye are wont to travel, on car that finds the light, laden with treasure.<br> 4 When, suppliant for your help, Lovers of Sweetness! I seeking wealth call you to our libation,<br> Hitherward let your vigorous horses bear you: drink ye with us the well-pressed Soma juices.<br> 5 Bring forward, Aśvins, Gods, to its fulfilment my never-wearied prayer that asks for riches.<br> Vouchsafe us all high spirit in the combat, and with your powers, O Lords of Power, assist us.<br> 6 Favour us in these prayers of ours, O Aśvins. May we have genial vigour, neer to fail us.<br> So may we, strong in children and descendants, go, wealthy, to the banquet that awaits you.<br> 7 Lovers of Sweetness, we have brought this treasure to you as twere an envoy sent for friendship.<br> Come unto us with spirits free from anger, in homes of men enjoying our oblation.<br> 8 With one, the same, intention, ye swift movers, oer the Seven Rivers hath your chariot travelled.<br> Yoked by the Gods, your strong steeds never weary while speeding forward at the pole they bear you.<br> 9 Exhaustless be your bounty to our princes who with their wealth incite the gift of riches,<br> Who further friendship with their noble natures, combining wealth in kine with wealth in herses.<br> 10 Now hear, O Youthful Twain, mine invocation: come, Aśvins, to the home where food aboundeth.<br> Vouchsafe us wealth, do honour to our nobles. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
