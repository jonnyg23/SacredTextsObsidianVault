 <p>1. VERILY wondrous is the tender Youngling's growth who never draweth nigh to drink his Mothers' milk.<br> As soon as she who hath no udder bore him, he, faring on his great errand, suddenly grew strong.<br> 2 Then Agni was his name, most active to bestow, gathering up the trees with his consuming tooth;<br> Skilled in fair sacrifice, armed with destroying tongue, impetuous as a bull that snorteth in the mead.<br> 3 Praise him, yourGod who, bird-like, rests upon a tree, scattering drops of juice and pouring forth his flood,<br> Speaking aloud with flame as with his lips a priest, and broadening his paths like one of high command.<br> 4 Thou Everlasting, whom, far-striding fain to burn, the winds, uninterrupted, never overcome,<br> They have approached, as warriors eager for the fight, heroic Trita, guiding him to gain his wish.<br> 5 This Agni is the best of Kaṇvas, Kaṇvas' Friend, Conqueror of the foe whether afar or near.<br> May Agni guard the singers, guard the princes well: may Agni grant to us our princes' gracious help.<br> 6 Do thou, Supitrya, swiftly following, make thyself the lord of Jātavedas, mightiest of all,<br> Who surely gives a boon even in thirsty land most powerful, prepared to aid us in the wilds.<br> 7 Thus noble Agni with princes and mortal men is lauded, excellent for conquering strength with chiefs,<br> Men who are well-disposed as friends and true to Law, even as the heavens in majesty surpass mankind.<br> 8 O Son of Strength, Victorious, with this title Upastuta's most potent voice reveres thee.<br> Blest with brave sons by thee we will extol thee, and lengthen out the days of our existence.<br> 9 Thus, Agni, have the sons of Vrstihavya, the Ṛṣis, the Upastutas invoked thee.<br> Protect them, guard the singers and the princes. With Vaṣaṭ! have they come, with hands uplifted, with their uplifted hands and cries of Glory!</p>
