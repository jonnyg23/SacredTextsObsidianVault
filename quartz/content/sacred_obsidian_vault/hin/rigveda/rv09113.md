 <p>1. LET Vṛtra-slaying Indra drink Soma by Śaryaṇāvān's side,<br> Storing up vigour in his heart, prepared to do heroic deeds. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 2 Lord of the Quarters, flow thou on, boon Soma, from Arjika land,<br> Effused with ardour and with faith, and the true hymn of sacrifice. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 3 Hither hath Sūrya's Daughter brought the wild Steer whom Parjanya nursed.<br> Gandharvas have seized bold of him, and in the Soma laid the juice. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 4 Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truthspeaking, truthful in thy works,<br> Enouncing faith, King Soma! thou, O Soma, whom thy maker decks. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 5 Together flow the meeting streams of him the Great and truly Strong.<br> The juices of the juicy meet. Made pure by prayer, O Golden-hued, flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 6 O Pavamana, where the priest, as he recites the rhythmic prayer,<br> Lords it oer Soma with the stone, with Soma bringing forth delight, flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 7 O Pavarnana, place me in that deathless, undecaying world<br> Wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 8 Make me immortal in that realm where dwells the King, Vivasvān's Son,<br> Where is the secret shrine of heaven, where are those waters young and fresh. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 9 Make me immortal in that realm where they move even as they list,<br> In the third sphere of inmost heaven where lucid worlds are full of light. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.<br> 10 Make me immortal in that realm of eager wish and strong desire,<br> The region of the radiant Moon, where food and full delight are found. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake:<br> 11 Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports, where<br> Joys and felicities combine, and longing wishes are fulfilled. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.</p>
