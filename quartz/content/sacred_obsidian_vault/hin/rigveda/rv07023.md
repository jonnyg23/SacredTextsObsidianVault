 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN XXIII. Indra.</h3>  
 <p>1. PRAYERS have been offered up through love of glory: Vasiṣṭha, honour Indra in the battle.<br> He who with might extends through all existence hears words which I, his faithful servant, utter.<br> 2 A cry was raised which reached the Gods, O Indra, a cry to them to send us strength in combat.<br> None among men knows his own life's duration: bear us in safety over these our troubles.<br> 3 The Bays, the booty-seeking car I harness: my prayers have reached him who accepts them gladly.<br> Indra, when he had slain resistless foemen, forced with his might the two world-halves asunder.<br> 4 Like barren cows, moreover, swelled the waters: the singen sought thy holy rite, O Indra.<br> Come unto us as with his team comes Vāyu: thou, through our solemn hymns bestowest booty.<br> 5 So may these gladdening draughts rejoice thee, Indra, the Mighty, very bounteous to the singer.<br> Alone among the Gods thou pitiest mortals: O Hero, make thee glad at this libation.<br> 6 Thus the Vasisthas glorify with praises Indra, the Powerful whose arm wields thunder.<br> Praised, may he guard our wealth in kine and heroes. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
