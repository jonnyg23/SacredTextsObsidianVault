 <p>1. I SEND forth even your God, victorious Agni, like a strong courser, with mine adoration.<br> Herald of sacrifice be he who knoweth he hath reached Gods, himself, with measured motion.<br> 2 By paths that are thine own come hither, Agni, joyous, delighting in the Gods alliance,<br> Making the heights of earth roar with thy fury, burning with eager teeth the woods and forests.<br> 3 The grass is strewn; the sacrifice advances adored as Priest, Agni is made propitious,<br> Invoking both All-boon-bestowing Mothers of whom, Most Youthful! thou wast born to help us.<br> 4 Forthwith the men, the best of these for wisdom, have made him leader in the solemn worship.<br> As Lord in homes of men is Agni stablished, the Holy One, the joyous, sweetly speaking.<br> 5 He hath come, chosen bearer, and is seated in man's home, Brahman, Agni, the Supporter,<br> He whom both Heaven anct Earth exalt and strengthenwhom, Giver of all boons, the Hotar worships.<br> 6 These have passed all in glory, who, the manly, have wrought with skill the hymn of adoration;<br> Who, listening, have advanced the people's welfare, and set their thoughts on this my holy statute.<br> 7 We, the Vasisthas, now implore thee, Agni, O Son of Strength, the Lord of wealth and treasure.<br> Thou hast brought food to singers and to nobles. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
