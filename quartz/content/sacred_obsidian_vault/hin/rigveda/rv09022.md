 <p>1. THESE rapid Soma-streams have stirred themselves to motion like strong steeds,<br> Like cars, like armies hurried forth.<br> 2 Swift as wide winds they lightly move, like rain-storms of Parjanya, like<br> The flickering flames of burning fire.<br> 3 These Soma juices, blent with curds, purified, skilled in sacred hymns,<br> Have gained by song their hearts'desire.<br> 4 Immortal, cleansed, these drops, since first they flowed, have never wearied, fain<br> To reach the regions and their paths.<br> 5 Advancing they have travelled oer the ridges of the earth and heaven,<br> And this the highest realm of all.<br> 6 Over the heights have they attained the highest thread that is spun out,<br> And this which must be deemed most high.<br> 7 Thou, Soma, boldest wealth in kine which thou hast seized from niggard churls:<br> Thou calledst forth the outspun thread.</p>
