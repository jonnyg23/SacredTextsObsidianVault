 <p>1. COMMON to all mankind, auspicious Sūrya, he who beholdeth all, is mounting upward;<br> The God, the eye of Varuṇa and Mitra, who rolled up darkness like a piece of leather.<br> 2 Sūrya's great ensign, restless as the billow, that urgeth men to action, is advancing:<br> Onward he still would roll the wheel well-rounded, which Etaśa, harnessed to the car-pole, moveth.<br> 3 Refulgent from the bosom of the Mornings, he in Whom singers take delight ascendeth.<br> This Savitar, God, is my chief joy and pleasure, who breaketh not the universal statute.<br> 4 Golden, far-seeing, from the heaven he riseth: far is his goal, he hasteth on resplendent.<br> Men, verily, inspirited by Sūrya speed to their aims and do the work assigned them.<br> 5 Where the irrunortals have prepared his pathway he flieth through the region like a falcon.<br> With homage and oblations will we serve you, O Mitra-Varuṇa, when the Sun hath risen.<br> 6 Now Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and for our children.<br> May we find paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
