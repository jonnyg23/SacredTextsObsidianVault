 <p>1. ONE half of day is dark, and bright the other: both atmospheres move on by sage devices.<br> Agni Vaiśvānara, when born as Sovran, hath with his lustre overcome the darkness.<br> 2 I know not either warp or woof, I know not the web they weave when moving to the contest.<br> Whose son shall here speak words that must be spoken without assistance from the Father near him?<br> 3 For both the warp and woof he understandeth, and in due time shall speak what should be spoken,<br> Who knoweth as the immortal world's Protector, descending, seeing with no aid from other.<br> 4 He is the Priest, the first of all: behold him. Mid mortal men he is the light immortal.<br> Here was he born, firm-seated in his station Immortal, ever waxing in his body.<br> 5 A firm light hath been set for men to look on: among all things that fly the mind is swiftest.<br> All Gods of one accord, with one intention, move unobstructed to a single purpose.<br> 6 Mine ears unclose to hear, mine eye to see him; the light that harbours in my spirit broadens.<br> Far roams my mind whose thoughts are in the distance. What shall I speak, what shall I now imagine?<br> 7 All the Gods bowed them down in fear before thee, Agni, when thou wast dwelling in the darkness.<br> Vaiśvānara be gracious to assist us, may the Immortal favour us and help us.</p>
