 <p>1. THE car which Indra, thou, for service of the Gods though it be far away, O swift One, bringest near, which, Blameless One, thou bringest near,<br> Place swiftly nigh us for our help: be it thy will that it be strong.<br> Blameless and active, hear this speech of orderers, this speech of us like orderers.<br> 2 Hear, Indra, thou whom men in every fight must call to show thy strength, for cry of battle with the men, with men of war for victory.<br> He who with heroes wins the light, who with the singers gains the prize,<br> Him the rich seek to gain even as a swift strong steed, even as a courser fleet and strong.<br> 3 Thou, Mighty, pourest forth the hide that holds the rain, thou keepest far away, Hero, the wicked man, thou shuttest out the wicked man.<br> Indra, to thee I sing, to Dyaus, to Rudra glorious in himself,<br> To Mitra, Varuṇa I sing a far-famed hymn to the kind God a far-famed hymn.<br> 4 We wish our Indra here that he may further you, the Friend, beloved of all, the very strong ally, in wars the very strong ally<br> In all encounters strengthen thou our prayer to be a help to us.<br> No enemywhom thou smitest downsubdueth thee, no enemy, whom thou smitest down.<br> 5 Bow down the overweening pride of every foe with succour like to kindling-wood in fiercest flame, with mighty succour, Mighty One.<br> Guide us, thou Hero, as of old, so art thou counted blameless still.<br> Thou drivest, as a Priest, all sins of man away, as Priest, in person, seeking us.<br> 6 This may I utter to the present Soma-drop, which, meet to be invoked, with power, awakes the prayer, awakes the demon-slaying prayer.<br> May he himself with darts of death drive far from us the scorner's hate.<br> Far let him flee away who speaketh wickedness and vanish like a mote of dust.<br> 7 By thoughtful invocation this may we obtain, obtain great wealth, O Wealthy One, with Hero sons, wealth that is sweet with hero sons.<br> Him who is wroth we pacify with sacred food and eulogies,<br> Indra the Holy with our calls inspired and true, the Holy One with calls inspired.<br> 8 On, for your good and ours, come Indra with the aid of his own lordliness to drive the wicked hence, to rend the evil-hearted ones!<br> The weapon which devouring fiends cast at us shall destroy themselves.<br> Struck down, it shall not reach the mark; hurled forth, the fire-brand shall not strike.<br> 9 With riches in abundance, Indra, come to us, come by an unobstructed path, come by a path from demons free.<br> Be with us when we stray afar, be with us when our home is nigh.<br> Protect us with thy help both near and far away: protect us ever with thy help.<br> 10 Thou art our own, O Indra, with victorious wealth: let might accompany thee, the Strong, to give us aid, like Mitra, to give mighty aid.<br> O strongest saviour, helper thou, Immortal! of each warrior's car.<br> Hurt thou another and not us, O Thunder-armed, one who would hurt, O Thunder-armed!<br> 11 Save us from injury, thou who art well extolled: ever the warder-off art thou of wicked ones, even as a God, of wicked ones;<br> Thou slayer of the evil fiend, saviour of singer such as I.<br> Good Lord, the Father made thee slayer of the fiends, made thee, good Lord, to slay the fiends.</p>
