 <p>1 NEER waxeth faint the Immortal, Son of Strength, since he, the Herald, hath become Vivasvān's messenger.<br> On paths most excellent he measured out mid-air: he with oblation calls to service of the Gods.<br> 2 Never decaying, seizing his appropriate food, rapidly, eagerly through the dry wood he spreads.<br> His back, as he is sprinkled, glistens like a horse: loud hath he roared and shouted like the heights of heaven?<br> 3 Set high in place oer all that Vasus, Rudras do, immortal, Lord of riches, seated as High Priest;<br> Hastening like a car to men, to those who live, the God without delay gives boons to be desired.<br> 4 Urged by the wind be spreads through dry wood as he lists, armed with his tongues for sickles, with a mighty roar.<br> Black is thy path, Agni, changeless, with glittering waves! when like a bull thou rushest eager to the trees.<br> 5 With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds, triumphant like a bull among the herd of cows,<br> With bright strength roaming to the everlasting air: things fixed, things moving quake before him as he flies.<br> 6 The Bhṛgus established thee among mankind for men, like as a treasure, beauteous, easy to invoke;<br> Thee, Agni, as a herald and choice-worthy guest, as an auspicious Friend to the Celestial Race.<br> 7 Agni, the seven tongues' deftest Sacrificer, him whom the priests elect at solemn worship,<br> The Herald, messenger of all the Vasus, I serve with dainty food, I ask for riches.<br> 8 Grant, Son of Strength, thou rich in friends, a refuge without a flaw this day to us thy praisers.<br> O Agni, Son of Strength, with forts of iron preserve thou from distress the man who lauds thee.<br> 9 Be thou a refuge, Bright One, to the singer, a shelter, Bounteous Lord, to those who worship.<br> Preserve the singer from distress, O Agni. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
