 <p>1. FORT-RENDER, Lord of Wealth, dispelling foemen, Indra with lightnings hath oercome the Dāsa.<br> Impelled by prayer and waxen great in body, he hath filled earth and heaven, the Bounteous Giver.<br> 2 I stimulate thy zeal, the Strong, the Hero decking my song of praise forth; Immortal.<br> O Indra, thou art equally the Leader of heavenly hosts and human generations.<br> 3 Leading, his band Indra encompassed Vṛtra; weak grew the wily leader of enchanters.<br> He who burns fierce in forests slaughtered Vyaṁsa, and made the Milch-kine of the nights apparent.<br> 4 Indra, light-winner, days' Creator, conquered, victorious, hostile bands with those who loved him.<br> For man the days' bright ensign he illumined, and found the light for his joy and gladness.<br> 5 Forward to fiercely falling blows pressed Indra, herolike doing many hero exploits.<br> These holy songs he taught the bard who gaised him, and widely spread these Dawns' resplendent colour.<br> 6 They laud the mighty acts of him the Mighty, the many glorious deeds performed by Indra.<br> He in his strength, with all-surpassing prowess, through wondrous arts crushed the malignant Dasyus.<br> 7 Lord of the brave, Indra who rules the people gave freedom to the Gods by might and battle.<br> Wise singers glorify with chanted praises these his achievements in Vivasvān's dwelling.<br> 8 Excellent, Conqueror, the victory-giver, the winner of the light and Godlike Waters,<br> He who hath won this broad earth and this heaven, -in Indra they rejoice who love devotions.<br> 9 He gained possession of the Sun and Horses, Indra obtained the Cow who feedeth many.<br> Treasure of gold he won; he smote the Dasyus, and gave protection to the Āryan colour.<br> 10 He took the plants and days for his possession; he gained the forest trees and air's mid-region.<br> Vala he cleft, and chased away opponents: thus was he tamer of the overweening.<br> 11 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered,<br> The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras, wins and gathers treasures.</p>
