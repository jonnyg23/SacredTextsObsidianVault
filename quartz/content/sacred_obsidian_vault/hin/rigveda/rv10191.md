 <p>1. THOU, mighty Agni, gatherest up all that is precious for thy friend.<br> Bring us all treasures as thou art enkindled in libation's place<br> 2 Assemble, speak together: let your minds be all of one accord,<br> As ancient Gods unanimous sit down to their appointed share.<br> 3 The place is common, common the assembly, common the mind, so be their thought united.<br> A common purpose do I lay before you, and worship with your general oblation.<br> 4 One and the same be your resolve, and be your minds of one accord.<br> United be the thoughts of all that all may happily agree.</p>    </body>
