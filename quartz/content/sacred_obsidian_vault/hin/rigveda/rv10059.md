 <p>1. His life hath been renewed and carried forward as two men, car-borne, by the skilful driver.<br> One falls, then seeks the goal with quickened vigour. Let Nirrti depart to distant places.<br> 2 Here is the psalm for wealth, and food, in plenty: let us do many deeds to bring us glory.<br> All these our doings shall delight the singer. Let Nirrti depart to distant places.<br> 3 May we oercome our foes with acts of valour, as heaven is over earth, hills over lowlands.<br> All these our deeds the singer hath considered. Let Nirrti depart to distant places.<br> 4 Give us not up as prey to death, O Soma still let us look upon the Sun arising.<br> Let our old age with passing days be kindly. Let Nirrti depart to distant places.<br> 5 O Asuniti, keep the soul within us, and make the days we have to live yet longer.<br> Grant that we still may look upon the sunlight: strengthen thy body with the oil we bring thee.<br> 6 Give us our sight again, O Asuniti, give us again our breath and our enjoyment.<br> Long may we look upon the Sun uprising; O Anumati, favour thou and bless us.<br> 7 May Earth restore to us our vital spirit, may Heaven the Goddess and mid-air restore it.<br> May Soma give us once again our body, and Pūṣan show the Path of peace and comfort.<br> 8 May both Worlds bless Subandhu, young Mothers of everlasting Law.<br> May Heaven and Earth uproot and sweep iniquity and shame away: nor sin nor sorrow trouble thee.<br> 9 Health-giving medicines descend sent down from heaven in twos and threes,<br> Or wandering singly on the earth. May Heaven and Earth uproot and sweep iniquity and shame away: nor sin nor sorrow trouble thee.<br> 10 Drive forward thou the wagon-ox, O Indra, which brought Usinarani's wagon hither.<br> May Heaven and Earth uproot and sweep iniquity and shame away: nor sin nor sorrow trouble thee.</p>
