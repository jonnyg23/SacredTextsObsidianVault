 <p>1. SING forth a hymn sublime and solemn, grateful to glorious. Varuṇa, imperial Ruler,<br> Who hath struck out, like one who slays the victim, earth as a skin to spread in front of Sūrya.<br> 2 In the tree-tops the air he hath extended, put milk in kine and vigorous speed in horses,<br> Set intellect in hearts, fire in the waters, Siurya in heaven and Soma on the mountain.<br> 3 Varuṇa lets the big cask, opening downward, flow through the heaven and earth and air's mid-region.<br> Therewith the universe's Sovran waters earth as the shower of rain bedews the barley.<br> 4 When Varuṇa is fain for milk he moistens the sky, the land, and earth to her foundation.<br> Then straight the mountains clothe them in the rain-cloud: the Heroes, putting forth their vigour, loose them.<br> 5 I will declare this mighty deed of magic, of glorious Varuṇa the Lord Immortal,<br> Who standing in the firmament hath meted the earth out with the Sun as with a measure.<br> 6 None, verily, hath ever let or hindered this the most wise God's mighty deed of magic,<br> Whereby with all their flood, the lucid rivers fill not one sea wherein they pour their waters.<br> 7 If we have sinned against the man who loves us, have ever wronged a brother, friend, or comrade,<br> The neighbour ever with us, or a stranger, O Varuṇa, remove from us the trespass.<br> 8 If we, as gamesters cheat at play, have cheated, done wrong unwittingly or sinned of purpose,<br> Cast all these sins away like loosened fetters, and, Varuṇa let us be thine own beloved.</p>
