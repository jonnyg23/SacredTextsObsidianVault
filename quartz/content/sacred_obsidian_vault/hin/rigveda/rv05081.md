 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN LXXXI. Savitar.</h3>  
 <p>1. THE priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns harness their spirit, yea, harness their holy thoughts.<br> He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea, lofty is the praise of Savitar the God.<br> 2 The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped and biped he hath brought forth good.<br> Excellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault, and shineth after the outgoing of the Dawn.<br> 3 Even he, the God whose going-forth and majesty the other Deities have followed with their might,<br> He who hath measured the terrestrial regions out by his great power, he is the Courser Savitar.<br> 4 To the three spheres of light thou goest, Savitar, and with the rays of Sidrya thou combinest thee.<br> Around, on both sides thou encompassest the night: yea, thou, O God, art Mitra through thy righteous laws.<br> 5 Over all generation thou art Lord alone: Pūṣan art thou, O God, in all thy goings-forth.<br> Yea, thou hast domination over all this world. Śyāvāśva hath brought praise to thee, O Savitar,</p>
