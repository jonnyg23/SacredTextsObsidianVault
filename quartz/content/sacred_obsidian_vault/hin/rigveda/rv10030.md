 <p>1. As twere with swift exertion of the spirit, let the priest speed to the celestial Waters,<br> The glorious food of Varuṇa and Mitra. To him who spreadeth far this laud I offer.<br> 2 Adhvaryus, he ye ready with oblations,, and come with longing to the longing Waters,<br> Down on which looks the. purple-tinted Eagle. Pour ye that flowing wave this day, deft-handed.<br> 3 Go to the reservoir, O ye Adhvaryus worship the Waters Child with your oblations.<br> A consecrated wave he now will give you, so press for him the Soma rich in sweetness.<br> 4 He who shines bright in floods, unfed with fuel, whom sages worship at their sacrifices:<br> Give waters rich in sweets, Child of the Waters, even those which gave heroic might to Indra:<br> 5 Those in which Soma joys and is delighted, as a young man with fair and pleasant damsels.<br> Go thou unto those Waters, O Adhvaryu, and purify with herbs what thou infusest.<br> 6 So maidens bow before the youthful gallant who comes with love to them who yearn to meet him.<br> In heart accordant and in wish one-minded are the Adhvaryus and the heavenly Waters.<br> 7 He who made room for you when fast imprisoned, who freed you from the mighty imprecation,<br> Even to that Indra send the meath-rich current, the wave that gratifies the Gods, O Waters.<br> 8 Send forth to him the meath-rich wave, O Rivers, which is your offspring and a well of sweetness,<br> Oil-balmed, to be implored at sacrifices. Ye wealthy Waters, hear mine invocation.<br> 9 Send forth the rapture-giving wave, O Rivers, which Indra drinks, which sets the Twain in motion;<br> The well that springeth from the clouds, desirous, that wandereth triple-formed, distilling transport.<br> 10 These winding Streams which with their double current, like cattle-raiders, seek the lower pastures,<br> Waters which dwell together, thrive together, Queens, Mothers of the world, these, Ṛṣi, honour.<br> 11 Send forth our sacrifice with holy worship send forth the hymn and prayer for gain of riches.<br> For need of sacrifice disclose the udder. Give gracious hearing to our call, O Waters.<br> 12 For, wealthy Waters, ye control all treasures: ye bring auspicious intellect and Amṛta.<br> Ye are the Queens of independent riches Sarasvatī give full life to the singer!<br> 13 When I behold the Waters coming hither, carrying with them milk and mcath and butter,<br> Bearing the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra, they harmonize in spirit with Adhvaryus.<br> 14 Rich, they are come with wealth for living beings, O friends, Adhvaryus, seat them in their places.<br> Seat them on holy grass, ye Soma-bringers in harmony with the Offspring of the Waters.<br> 15 Now to this grass are come the longing Waters: the Pious Ones are seated at our worship.<br> Adbvaryus, press the Soma juice for Indra so will the service of the Gods be easy.</p>
