 <p>1. ASSOCIATE with fires, make your God Agni envoy at sacrifice, best skilled in worship,<br> Established firm among mankind, the Holy, flame-crowned and fed with oil, the Purifier.<br> 2 Like a steed neighing eager for the pasture, when he hath stepped forth from the great enclosure:<br> Then the wind following blows upon his splendour, and, straight, the path is black which thou hast travelled.<br> 3 From thee a Bull but newly born, O Agni, the kindled everlasting flames rise upward.<br> Aloft to heaven thy ruddy smoke ascendeth: Agni, thou speedest to the Gods as envoy.<br> 4 Thou whose fresh lustre oer the earth advanceth when greedily with thy jaws thy food thou eatest.<br> Like a host hurried onward comes thy lasso: fierce, with thy tongue thou piercest, as twere barley.<br> 5 The men have decked him both at eve and morning, Most Youthful Agni, as they tend a courser.<br> They kindle him, a guest within his dwelling: bright shines the splendour of the worshipped Hero.<br> 6 O fair of face, beautiful is thine aspect when, very near at hand, like gold thou gleamest,<br> Like Heaven's thundering roar thy might approaches, and like the wondrous Sun thy light thou showest.<br> 7 That we may worship, with your Hail to Agni! with sacrificial cakes and fat oblations,<br> Guard us, O Agni, with those boundless glories as with a hundred fortresses of iron.<br> 8 Thine are resistless songs for him who offers, and hero-giving hymns wherewith thou savest;<br> With these, O Son of Strength, O Jātavedas, guard us, preserve these princes and the singers.<br> 9 When forth he cometh, like an axe new-sharpened, pure in his form, resplendent in his body,<br> Sprung, sought with eager longing, from his Parents, for the Gods worship, Sage and Purifier:<br> 10 Shine this felicity on us, O Agni: may we attain to perfect understanding.<br> All happiness be theirs who sing and praise thee. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
