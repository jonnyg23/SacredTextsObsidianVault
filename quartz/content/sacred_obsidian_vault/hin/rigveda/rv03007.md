 <p>1. THE seven tones risen from the whitebacked viand have made their way between the pair of Mothers.<br> Both circumjacent Parents come together to yield us length of days they hasten forward.<br> 2 The Male who dwells in heaven hath Mares and Milchkine: he came to Goddesses who bring sweet treasure.<br> To thee safe resting in the seat of Order the Cow alone upon her way proceedeth.<br> 3 Wise Master, wealthy finder-out of riches, he mounted those who may with case be guided.<br> He, dark-backed, manifold with varied aspect, hath made them burst forth from their food the brush-wood.<br> 4 Strength-giving streams bear hither him eternal, fain to support the mighty work. of Tvaṣṭar.<br> He, flashing in his home with all his members, hath entered both the worlds as they were single.<br> 5 They know the red Bull's blessing, and are joyful under the flaming-coloured Lord's dominion:<br> They who give shine from heavenwith fair effulgence, whose lofty song like Iḷā must be honoured.<br> 6 Yea, by tradition from the ancient sages they brought great strength from the two mighty Parents,<br> To where the singer's Bull, the night's dispeller, after his proper law hath waxen stronger.<br> 7 Seven holy singers guard with five Adhvaryus the Bird's beloved firmly-settled station.<br> The willing Bulls, untouched by old, rejoice them: as Gods themselves the ways of Gods they follow.<br> 8 I crave the grace of heaven's two chief Invokers: the seven swift steeds joy in their wonted manner.<br> These speak of truth, praising the Truth Eternal, thinking on Order as the guards of Order.<br> 9 The many seek the great Steed as a stallion: the reins obey the Lord of varied colour.<br> O heavenly Priest, most pleasant, full of wisdom, bring the great Gods to us, and Earth and Heaven.<br> 10 Rich Lord, the Mornings have gleamed forth in splendour, fair-rayed, fair-speaking, worshipped with all viands,<br> Yea, with the glory of the earth, O Agni. Forgive us, for our weal, een sin cornmitted.<br> 11 As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels.<br> To us be born a son, and spreading offspring Agni, be this thy gracious will to usward.</p>
