 <p>1. GREAT art thou, Agni, sacrifice's Herald: not without thee are deathless Gods made joyful.<br> Come hither with all Deities about thee here take thy seat, the first, as Priest, O Agni.<br> 2 Men with oblations evermore entreat thee, the swift, to undertake an envoy's duty.<br> He on whose sacred grass with Gods thou sittest, to him, O Agni, are the days propitious.<br> 3 Three times a day in thee are shown the treasures sent for the mortal who presents oblation.<br> Bring the Gods hither like a man, O Agni: be thou our envoy, guarding us from curses.<br> 4 Lord of the lofty sacrifice is Agni, Agni is Lord of every gift presented.<br> The Vasus were contented with his wisdom, so the Gods made him their oblationbearer.<br> 5 O Agni, bring the Gods to taste our presents: with Indra leading, here let them be joyful.<br> Convey this sacrifice to Gods in heaven. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
