 <p>1. LIKE Aṅgiras a gladdening laud we ponder to him who loveth song, exceeding mighty.<br> Let us sing glory to the far-famed Hero who must be praised with fair hymns by the singer.<br> 2 Unto the great bring ye great adoration, a chant with praise to him exceeding mighty,<br> Through whom our sires, Aṅgirases, singing praises and knowing well the places, found the cattle.<br> 3 When Indra and the Aṅgirases desired it, Saramā found provision for her offspring.<br> Bṛhaspati cleft the mountain, found the cattle: the heroes shouted with the kine in triumph.<br> 4 Mid shout, loud shout, and roar, with the Navagvas, seven singers, hast thou, heavenly, rent the mountain;<br> Thou hast, with speeders, with Daśagvas, Indra, Śakra, with thunder rent obstructive Vala.<br> 5 Praised by Aṅgirases, thou, foe-destroyer, hast, with the Dawn, Sun, rays, dispelled the darkness.<br> Thou Indra, hast spread out the earth's high ridges, and firmly fixed the region under heaven.<br> 6 This is the deed most worthy of all honour, the fairest marvel of the Wonder-Worker,<br> That, nigh where heaven bends down, he made four rivers flow full with waves that carry down sweet water.<br> 7 Unwearied, won with lauding hymns, he parted of old the ancient Pair, united ever.<br> In highest sky like Bhaga, he the doer of marvels set both Dames and earth and heaven.<br> 8 Still born afresh, young Dames, each in her manner, unlike in hue, the Pair in alternation<br> Round heaven and earth from ancient time have travelled, Night with her dark limbs, Dawn with limbs of splendour.<br> 9 Rich in good actions, skilled in operation, the Son with might maintains his perfect friendship.<br> Thou in the raw cows, black of hue or ruddy, storest the ripe milk glossy white in colour.<br> 10 Their paths, of old connected, rest uninjured; they with great might preserve the immortal statutes.<br> For many thousand holy works the Sisters wait on the haughty Lord like wives and matrons.<br> 11 Thoughts ancient, seeking wealth, with adoration, with newest lauds have sped to thee, O Mighty.<br> As yearning wives cleave to their yearning husband, so cleave our hymns to thee, O Lord most potent.<br> 12 Strong God, the riches which thy hands have holden from days of old have perished not nor wasted.<br> Splendid art thou, O Indra, wise, unbending: strengthen us with might, O Lord of Power.<br> 13 O mighty Indra, Gotama's son Nodhas hath fashioned this new prayer to thee Eternal,<br> Sure leader, yoker of the Tawny Coursers. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
