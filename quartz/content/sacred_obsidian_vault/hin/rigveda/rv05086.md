 <p>1. THE mortal man whom ye, the Twain, Indra and Agni, help in fight,<br> Breaks through een strongly-guarded wealth as Tṛta burst his way through reeds.<br> 2 The Twain invincible in war, worthy to be renowned in frays,<br> Lords of the Fivefold. People, these, Indra and Agni, we invoke.<br> 3 Impetuous is their strength, and keen the lightning of the mighty Pair,<br> Which from their arms speeds with the car to Vṛtra's slayer for the kine.<br> 4 Indra and Agni, we invoke you both, as such, to send your cars:<br> Lords of quick-coming bounty, ye who know, chief lovers of the song.<br> 5 These who give increase day by day, Gods without guile for mortal man,<br> Worthy themselves, I honour most, Two Gods as partners, for my horse.<br> 6 The strength-bestowing offering thus to Indra-Agni hath been paid, as butter, purified by stones.<br> Deal to our princes high renown, deal wealth to those who sing your praise, deal food to those who sing your praise.</p>
