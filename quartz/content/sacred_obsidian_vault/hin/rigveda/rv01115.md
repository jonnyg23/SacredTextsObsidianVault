 <p>1. THE brilliant presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni.<br> The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the Sun hath filled the air and earth and heaven.<br> 2 Like as a young man followeth a maiden, so doth the Sun the Dawn, refulgent Goddess:<br> Where pious men extend their generations, before the Auspicious One for happy fortune.<br> 3 Auspicious are the Sun's Bay-coloured Horses, bright, changing hues, meet for our shouts of triumph.<br> Bearing our prayers, the sky's ridge have they mounted, and in a moment speed round earth and heaven.<br> 4 This is the Godhead, this might of Sūrya: he hath withdrawn what spread oer work unfinished.<br> When he hath loosed his Horses from their station, straight over all Night spreadeth out her garment.<br> 5 In the sky's lap the Sun this form assumeth that Varuṇa and Mitra may behold it.<br> His Bay Steeds well maintain his power eternal, at one time bright and darksome at another.<br> 6 This day, O Gods, while Sūrya is ascending, deliver us from trouble and dishonour.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
