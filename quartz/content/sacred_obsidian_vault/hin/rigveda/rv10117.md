 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Rig Veda</i>, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1896], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN CXVII. Liberality.</h3>  
 <p>1. THE Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape.<br> The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds none to comfort him.<br> 2 The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat,<br> Hardens his heart against him-even when of old he did him service-finds not one to comfort him.<br> 3 Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food and feeble.<br> Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in future troubles.<br> 4 No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food, will offer nothing.<br> Let him depart-no home is that to rest in-, and rather seek a stranger to support him.<br> 5 Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer pathway.<br> Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling.<br> 6 The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food -I speak the truth- shall be his ruin.<br> He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats with no partaker.<br> 7 The ploughshare ploughing makes the food that feeds us, and with its feet cuts through the path it follows.<br> Better the speaking than the silent Brahman: the liberal friend outyalues him who gives not.<br> 8 He with one foot hath far outrun the biped, and the two-footed catches the three-footed.<br> Four-footed creatures come when bipeds call them, and stand and look where five are met together.<br> 9 The hands are both alike: their labour differs. The yield of sister milch-kine is unequal.<br> Twins even diffier in their strength and vigour: two, even kinsmen, differ in their bounty.</p>
