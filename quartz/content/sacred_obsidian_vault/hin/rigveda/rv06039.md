 <p>1. OF this our charming, our celestial Soma, eloquent, wise, Priest, with inspired devotion,<br> Of this thy close attendant, hast thou drunken. God, send the singer food with milk to grace it.<br> 2 Craving the kine, rushing against the mountain led on by Law, with holyminded comrades,<br> He broke the never-broken ridge of Vala. With words of might Indra subdued the Paṇis.<br> 3 This Indu lighted darksome nights, O Indra, throughout the years, at morning and at evening.<br> Him have they stablished as the days' bright ensign. He made the Mornings to be born in splendour.<br> 4 He shone and caused to shme the worlds that shone not. By Law he lighted up the host of Mornings.<br> He moves with Steeds yoked by eternal Order, contenting men with nave that finds the sunlight.<br> 5 Now, praised, O Ancient King! fill thou the singer with plenteous food that he may deal forth treasures.<br> Give waters, herbs that have no poison, forests, and kine, and steeds, and men, to him who lauds thee.</p>
