 <p>1. FROM both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin,<br> Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away.<br> 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,<br> From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away.<br> 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart,<br> From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away.<br> 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet,<br> From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away.<br> 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails,<br> From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.<br> 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint,<br> From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.</p>
