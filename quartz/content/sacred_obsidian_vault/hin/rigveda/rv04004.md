 <p>1. PUT forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour; go like a mighty King with his attendants.<br> Thou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the fiends with darts that burn most fiercely.<br> 2 Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them closely, glowing in thy fury.<br> Spread with thy tongue the winged flames, O Agni; unfettered, cast thy firebrands all around thee.<br> 3 Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion; be, neer deceived, the guardian of this people<br> From him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no trouble sent from thee oercome us.<br> 4 Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us: burn down our foes, thou who hast sharpened arrows.<br> Him, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume thou utterly like dried-up stubble.<br> 5 Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make manifest thine own celestial vigour.<br> Slacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our foemen whether kin or stranger.<br> 6 Most Youthful God, he knoweth well thy favour who gave an impulse to this high devotion.<br> All fair days and magnificence of riches hast thou beamed forth upon the good man's portals.<br> 7 Blest, Agni, be the man, the liberal giver, who with his lauds and regular oblation<br> Is fain to please thee for his life and dwelling. May all his days be bright: be this his longing.<br> 8 I praise thy gracious favour: sing in answer. May this my song sing like a loved one with thee.<br> Lords of good steeds and cars may we adorn thee, and day by day vouchsafe thou us dominion.<br> 9 Here of free choice let each one serve thee richly, resplendent day by day at eve and morning.<br> So may we honour thee, content and joyous, passing beyond the glories of the people.<br> 10 Whoso with good steeds and fine gold, O Agni, comes nigh thee on a car laden with treasure,<br> His Friend art thou, yea, thou art his Protector whose joy it is to entertain thee duly.<br> 11 Through words and kinship I destroy the mighty: this power I have from Gotama my father.<br> Mark thou this speech of ours, O thou Most Youthful, Friend of the House, exceeding wise, Invoker.<br> 12 Knowing no slumber, speedy and propitious, alert and ever friendly, most unwearied,<br> May thy protecting powers, unerring Agni, taking their places here, combined, preserve us.<br> 13 Thy guardian rays, O Agni, when they saw him, preserved blind Māmateya from affliction.<br> Lord of all riches, he preserved the pious: the fees who fain would harm them did no mischief<br> 14 Aided by thee with thee may we be wealthy, may we gain strength with thee to guide us onward.<br> Fulfil the words of both, O Ever Truthful: straightway do this, thou God whom power emboldens.<br> 15 O Agni, with this fuel will we serve thee; accept the laud we sing to thee with favour<br> Destroy the cursing Rākṣasas: preserve us, O rich in friends, from guile and scorn and slander.</p>
