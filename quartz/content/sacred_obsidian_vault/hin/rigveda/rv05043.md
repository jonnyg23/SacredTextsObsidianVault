 <p>1. MAY the Milch-cows who hasten to their object come harmless unto us with liquid sweetness.<br> The Singer, lauding, calls, for ample riches, the Seven Mighty Ones who bring enjoyment.<br> 2 With reverence and fair praise will I bring hither, for sake of strength, exhaustless Earth and Heaven.<br> Father and Mother, sweetof speech, fairhanded, may they, far-famed, in every fight protect us.<br> 3 Adhvaryus, make the sweet libations ready, and bring the beautiful bright juice to Vāyu.<br> God, as our Priest, be thou the first to drink it: we give thee of the mead to make thee joyful.<br> 4 Two arms-the Soma's dexterous immo. lators-and the ten fingers set and fix the press-stone.<br> The stalk hath poured, fair with its spreading branches, the mead's bright glittering juice that dwells on mountains.<br> 5 The Soma hath been pressed for thee, its lover, to give thee power and might and high enjoyment.<br> Invoked, turn hither in thy car, O Indra, at need, thy two well-trained and dear Bay Horses.<br> 6 Bring by God-traversed paths, accordant, Agni, the great Aramati, Celestial Lady,<br> Exalted, worshipped with our gifts and homage, who knoweth holy Law, to drink sweet Soma.<br> 7 As on his father's lap the son, the darling, so on the fire is set the sacred caldron,<br> Which holy singers deck, as if extending and heating that which holds the fatty membrane.<br> 8 Hither, as herald to invite the Aśvins, come the great lofty song, most sweet and pleasant!<br> Come in one car, joy-givers! to the banquet, like the bolt binding pole and nave, come hither.<br> 9 I have declared this speech of adoration to mightiest Pūṣan and victorious Vāyu,<br> Who by their bounty are the hymns' inspirers, and of themselves give power as a possession.<br> 10 Invoked by us bring hither, jatavedas the Maruts all under their names and figures.<br> Come to the sacrifice with aid all Maruts, all to the songs and praises of the singer!<br> 11 From high heaven may Sarasvatī the Holy visit our sacrifice, and from the mountain.<br> Eager, propitious, may the balmy Goddess hear our effectual speech, our invocation.<br> 12 Set in his seat the God whose back is dusky, Bṛhaspati the lofty, the Disposer.<br> Him let us worship, set within the dwelling, the red, the golden-hued, the allresplendent.<br> 13 May the Sustainer, high in heaven, come hither, the Bounteous One, invoked, with all his favours,<br> Dweller with Dames divine, with plants, unwearied, the Steer with triple horn, the life-bestower.<br> 14 The tuneful eloquent priests of him who liveth have sought the Mother's bright and loftiest station.<br> As living men, with offered gifts and homage they deck the most auspicious Child to clothe him.<br> 15 Agni, great vital power is thine, the mighty: pairs waxing old in their devotion seek thee.<br> May every Deity be swift to listen, and Mother Earth with no ill thought regard me.<br> 16 Gods, may we dwell in free untroubled bliss.<br> 17 May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.<br> Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy, Immortals!</p>
