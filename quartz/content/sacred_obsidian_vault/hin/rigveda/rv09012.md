 <p>1. To Indra have the Soma drops, exceeding rich in sweets, been poured,<br> Shed in the seat of sacrifice.<br> 2 As mother kine low to their calves, to Indra have the sages called,<br> Called him to drink the Soma juice.<br> 3 In the stream's wave wise Soma dwells, distilling rapture, in his seat,<br> Resting upon a wiId-cow's hide.<br> 4 Far-sighted Soma, Sage and Seer, is worshipped in the central point<br> Of heaven, the straining-cloth of wool.<br> 5 In close embraces Indu holds Soma when<br> poured within the jars.<br> And on the. purifying sieve.<br> 6 Indu sends forth a voice on high to regions of the sea of air,<br> Shaking the vase that drops with meath.<br> 7 The Tree whose praises never fail yields heavenly milk among our hymns,<br> Urging men's generations on.<br> 8 The Wise One, with the Sage's stream, the Soma urged to speed, flows on<br> To the dear places of the sky.<br> 9 O Pavamana, bring us wealth bright with a thousand splendours. Yea.<br> O Indu, give us ready help.</p>
