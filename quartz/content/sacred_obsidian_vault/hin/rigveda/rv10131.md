 <p>1. DRIVE all our enemies away, O Indra, the western, mighty Conqueror, and the eastern.<br> Hero, drive off our northern foes and southern, that we in thy wide shelter may be joyful.<br> 2 What then? As men whose fields are full of barley reap the ripe corn removing it in order,<br> So bring the food of those men, bring it hither, who went not to prepare the grass for worship.<br> 3 Men come not with one horse at sacred seasons; thus they obtain no honour in assemblies.<br> Sages desiring herds of kine and horses strengthen the mighty Indra for his friendship.<br> 4 Ye, Aśvins, Lords of Splendour, drank full draughts of grateful Soma juice,<br> And aided Indra in his work with Namuci of Asura birth.<br> 5 As parents aid a son, both Aśvins, Indra, aided thee with their wondrous Powers and wisdom.<br> When thou, with might. hadst drunk the draught that gladdens, Sarasvatī, O Maghavan, refreshed thee.<br> 6 Indra is strong to save, rich in assistance may he, possessing all, be kind and gracious.<br> May he disperse our foes and give us safety, and may we be the lords of hero vigou r.<br> 7 May we enjoy his favour, his the Holy may we enjoy his blessed loving kindness.<br> May this rich Indra, as our good Protector, drive off and keep afar all those who hate us.</p>
