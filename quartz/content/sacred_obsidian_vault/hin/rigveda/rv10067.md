 <p>1. THIS holy hymn, sublime and sevenheaded, sprung from eternal Law, our sire discovered.<br> Ayasya, friend of all men, hath engendered the fourth hymn as he sang his laud to Indra.<br> 2 Thinking aright, praising eternal Order, the sons of Dyaus the Asura, those heroes,<br> Aṅgirases, holding the rank of sages, first honoured sacrifice's holy statute.<br> 3 Girt by his friends who cried with swanlike voices, bursting the stony barriers of the prison,<br> Bṛhaspati spake in thunder to the cattle, and uttered praise and song when he had found them.<br> 4 Apart from one, away from two above him, he drave the kine that stood in bonds of falsehood.<br> Bṛhaspati, seeking light amid the darkness, drave forth the bright cows: three he made apparent.<br> 5 When he had cleft the lairs and western castle, he cut off three from him who held the waters.<br> Bṛhaspati discovered, while he thundered like Dyaus, the dawn, the Sun, the cow, the lightning.<br> 6 As with a hand, so with his roaring Indra cleft Vala through, the guardian of the cattle.<br> Seeking the milk-draught with sweatshining comrades he stole the Paṇi's kine and left him weeping.<br> 7 He with bright faithful Friends, winners of booty, hath rent the milker of the cows asunder.<br> Bṛhaspati with wild boars strong and mighty, sweating with heat, hath gained a rich possession.<br> 8 They, longing for the kine, with faithful spirit incited with their hymns the Lord of cattle.<br> Bṛhaspati freed the radiant cows with comrades self-yoked, averting shame from one another.<br> 9 In our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth like a lion,<br> Maywe, in every fight where heroes conquer, rejoice in strong Bṛhaspati the Victor.<br> 10 When he had won him every sort of booty and gone to heaven and its most lofty mansions,<br> Men praised Bṛhaspati the Mighty, bringing the light within their mouths from sundry places.<br> 11 Fulfil the prayer that begs for vital vigour: aid in your wonted manner even the humble.<br> Let all our foes be turned and driven backward. Hear this, O Heaven and Earth, ye All-producers.<br> 12 Indra with mighty strength cleft asunder the head of Arbuda the watery monster,<br> Slain Ahi, and set free the Seven Rivers. O Heaven and Earth, with all the Gods protect us.</p>
