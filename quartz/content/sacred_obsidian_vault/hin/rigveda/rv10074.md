 <p>1. I AM prepared to laud with song or worship the Noble Ones who are in earth and heaven,<br> Or Coursers who have triumphed in, the contest, or those who famed, have won the prize with glory.<br> 2 Their call, the call of Gods, went up to heaven: they kissed the ground with glory-seeking spirit,<br> There where the Gods look on for happy fortune, and like the kindly heavens bestow their bounties.<br> 3 This is the song of those Immortal Beings who long for treasures in their full perfection.<br> May these, completing prayers and sacrifices, bestow upon us wealth where naught is wanting.<br> 4 Those living men extolled thy deed, O Indra, those who would fain burst through the stall of cattle,<br> Fain to milk her who bare but once, great, lofty, whose Sons are many and her streams past number.<br> 5 Sacivan, win to your assistance Indra who never bends, who overcomes his foemen.<br> Ṛbhukṣan, Maghavan, the hymn's upholder, who, rich in food, bears man's kind friend, the thunder.<br> 6 Since he who won of old anew hath triumphed, Indra hath earned his name of Vṛtra-slaycr.<br> He hath appeared, the mighty Lord of Conquest. What we would have him do let him accomplish.</p>
