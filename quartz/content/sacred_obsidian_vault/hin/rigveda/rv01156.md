 <p>1. FAR-SHINING, widely famed, going thy wonted way, fed with the oil, be helpful. Mitra-like, to us.<br> So, Viṣṇu, een the wise must swell thy song of praise, and he who hath oblations pay thee solemn rites.<br> 2 He who brings gifts to him the Ancient and the Last, to Viṣṇu who ordains, together with his Spouse,<br> Who tells the lofty birth of him the Lofty One, shall verily surpass in glory een his peer.<br> 3 Him have ye satisfied, singers, as well as ye know, primeval germ of Order even from his birth.<br> Ye, knowing een his name, have told it forth: may we, Viṣṇu, enjoy the grace of thee the Mighty One.<br> 4 The Sovran Varuṇa and both the Aśvins wait on this the will of him who guides the Marut host.<br> Viṣṇu hath power supreme and might that finds the day, and with his Friend unbars the stable of the kine.<br> 5 Even he the Heavenly One who came for fellowship, Viṣṇu to Indra, godly to the godlier,<br> Who Maker, throned in three worlds, helps the Āryan man, and gives the worshipper his share of Holy Law.</p>
