 <p>1. MAY we, the pious, win much food by prayer, may Agni with fair light pervade each act,<br> He the observer of the heavenly laws of Gods, and of the race of mortal man.<br> 2 He who is germ of waters, germ of woods, germ of all things that move not and that move,<br> To him even in the rock and in the house: Immortal One, he cares for all mankind.<br> 3 Agni is Lord of riches for the man who serves him readily with sacred songs.<br> Protect these beings thou with careful thought, knowing the races both of Gods and men.<br> 4 Whom many dawns and nights, unlike, make strong, whom, born in Law, all things that move and stand,<br> He hath been won, Herald who sits in light, making effectual all our holy works.<br> 5 Thou settest value on our cows and woods: all shall bring tribute to us to the light.<br> Men have served thee in many and sundry spots, parting, as twere, an aged father's wealth.<br> 6 Like a brave archer, like one skilled and bold, a fierce avenger, so he shines in fight.</p>
