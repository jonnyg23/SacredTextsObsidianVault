 <p>1. FULL of effectual wisdom Savitar the God hath stretched out golden arms that he may bring forth life.<br> Young and most skilful, while he holds the region up, the Warrior sprinkles fatness over both his hands.<br> 2 May we enjoy the noblest vivifying force of Savitar the God, that he may give us wealth:<br> For thou art mighty to produce and lull to rest the world of life that moves on two feet and on four.<br> 3 Protect our habitation, Savitar, this day, with guardian aids around, auspicious, firm and true.<br> God of the golden tongue, keep us for newest bliss: let not the evil-wisher have us in his power.<br> 4 This Savitar the God, the golden-handed, Friend of the home, hath risen to meet the twilight.<br> With cheeks of brass, with pleasant tongue, the Holy, he sends the worshipper rich gifts in plenty.<br> 5 Like a Director, Savitar hath extended his golden arms, exceeding fair to look on.<br> He hath gone up the heights of earth and heaven, and made each monster fall and cease from troubling.<br> 6 Fair wealth, O Savitar, to-day, to-morrow, fair wealth produce for us each day that passes.<br> May we through this our song be happy gainers, God, of a fair and spacious habitation.</p>
