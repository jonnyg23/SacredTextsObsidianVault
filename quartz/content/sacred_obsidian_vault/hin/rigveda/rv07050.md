 <p>1. O MITRA-VARUNA, guard and protect me here: let not that come to me which nests within and swells.<br> I drive afar the scorpion hateful to the sight: let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot.<br> 2 Eruption that appears upon the twofold joints, and that which overspreads the ankles and the knees,<br> May the refulgent Agni banish far away let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot.<br> 3 The poison that is formed upon the Salmali, that which is found in streams, that which the plants produce,<br> All this may all the Gods banish and drive away: let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot.<br> 4 The steep declivities, the valleys, and the heights, the channels full of water, and the waterless-<br> May those who swell with water, gracious Goddesses, never afflict us with the Sipada disease, may all the rivers keep us free from Simida.</p>
