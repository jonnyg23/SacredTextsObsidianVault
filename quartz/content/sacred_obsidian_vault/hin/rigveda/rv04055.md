 <p>1. WHO of you, Vasus, saveth? who protecteth? O Heaven and Earth and Aditi, preserve us,<br> Varuṇa., Mitra, from the stronger mortal. Gods, which of you at sacrifice giveth comfort?<br> 2 They who with laud extol the ancient statutes, when they shine forth infallible dividers,<br> Have ordered as perpetual Ordainers, and beamed as holy-thoughted Wonder-Workers.<br> 3 The Housewife Goddess, Aditi, and Sindhu, the Goddess Svasti I implore for friendship:<br> And may the unobstructed Night and Morning both, day and night, provide for our protection.<br> 4 Aryaman, Varuṇa have disclosed the pathway, Agni as Lord of Strength the road to welfare.<br> Lauded in manly mode may Indra-Viṣṇu grant us their powerful defence and shelter.<br> 5 I have besought the favour of the Maruts, of Parvata, of Bhaga God who rescues.<br> From trouble caused by man the Lord preserve us; from woe sent by his friend let Mitra save us.<br> 6 Agree, through these our watery oblations, Goddesses, Heaven and Earth, with Ahibudhnya.<br> As if to win the sea, the Gharma-heaters have opened, as they come anear, the rivers.<br> 7 May Goddess Aditi with Gods defend us, save us the saviour God with care unceasing.<br> We dare not stint the sacred food of Mitra and Varuṇa upon the back of Agni.<br> 8 Agni is Sovran Lord of wealth, Agni of great prosperity:<br> May he bestow these gifts on us.<br> 9 Hither to us, rich pleasant Dawn, bring many things to be desired,<br> Thou who hast ample store of wealth.<br> 10 So then may Bhaga, Savitar, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Indra, with bounty come to us.</p>
