 <p>1. GRACIOUSLY listen to our songs, Maghavan, be not negligent.<br> As thou hast made us full of joy and lettest us solicit thee, now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 2 Well have they eaten and rejoiced; the friends have risen and passed away.<br> The sages luminous in themselves have. praised thee with their latest hymn. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 3 Maghavan, we will reverence thee who art so fair to look upon.<br> Thus praised, according to our wish come now with richly laden car. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 4 He will in very truth ascend the powerful car that finds the kine,<br> Who thinks upon the well-filled bowl, the Tawny Coursers' harnesser. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 5 Let, Lord of Hundred Powers, thy Steeds be harnessed on the right and left.<br> Therewith in rapture of the juice, draw near to thy beloved Spouse. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds.<br> 6 With holy prayer I yoke thy long-maned pair of Bays: come hitherward; thou holdest them in both thy hands.<br> The stirring draughts of juice outpoured have made thee glad: thou, Thunderer, hast rejoiced with Pūṣan and thy Spouse.</p>
