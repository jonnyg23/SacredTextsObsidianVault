 <p>1. SAVITAR, golden-haired, hath lifted eastward, bright With the sunbeams, his eternal lustre;<br> He in whose energy wise Pūṣan marches, surveying all existence like a herdsman.<br> 2 Beholding men he sits amid the heaven filling the two world-halves and air's wide region.<br> He looks upon the rich far-spreading pastures between the eastern and the western limit.<br> 3 He, root of wealth, the gatherer-up of treasures, looks with his might on every form and figure.<br> Savitar, like a Godẉhose Law is constant, stands in the battle for the spoil like Indra.<br> 4 Waters from sacrifice came to the Gandharva Visvavasu, O Soma, when they saw him.<br> Indra, approaching quickly, marked their going, and looked around upon the Sun's enclosures.<br> 5 This song Visvavasu shall sing us, meter of air's mid-realm celestial Gandharva,<br> That we may know aright both truth and falsehood: may he inspire our thoughts and help our praises.<br> 6 In the floods' track he found the bootyseeker: the rocky cow-pen's doors he threw wide open.<br> These, the Gandharva told him, Rowed with Amṛta. Indra knew well the puissancc of the dragons.</p>
