 <p>1 SING forth, O Kaṇvas, to your band of Maruts unassailable,<br> Sporting, resplendent on their car<br> 2 They who, self-luminous, were born together, with the spotted deer,<br> Spears, swords, and glittering ornaments.<br> 3 One hears, as though twere close at hand, the cracking of the whips they hold<br> They gather glory on their way.<br> 4 Now sing ye forth the God-given hymn to your exultant Marut host,<br> The fiercely-vigorous, the strong.<br> 5 Praise ye the Bull among the cows; for tis the Maruts sportive band:<br> It strengthened as it drank the rain.<br> 6 Who is your mightiest, Heroes, when, O shakers of the earth and heaven,<br> Ye shake them like a garment's hem?<br> 7 At your approach man holds him down before the fury of your wrath:<br> The rugged-jointed mountain yields.<br> 8 They at whose racings forth the earth, like an age-weakened lord of men,<br> Trembles in terror on their ways.<br> 9 Strong is their birth: vigour have they to issue from their Mother; strength,<br> Yea, even twice enough, is theirs.<br> 10 And these, the Sons, the Singers, in their racings have enlarged the bounds,<br> So that the kine must walk knee-deep.<br> 11 Before them, on the ways they go, they drop this offspring of the cloud,<br> Long, broad, and inexhaustible.<br> 12 O Maruts, as your strength is great, so have ye cast men down on earth,<br> So have ye made the mountains fall.<br> 13 The while the Maruts pass along, they talk together on the way:<br> Doth any hear them as they speak?<br> 14 Come quick with swift steeds, for ye have worshippers among Kaṇva's sons<br> May you rejoice among them well.<br> 15 All is prepared for your delight. We are their servants evermore,<br> To live as long as life may last.</p>
