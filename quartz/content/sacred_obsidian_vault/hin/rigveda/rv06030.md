 <p>1. INDRA hath waxed yet more for hero prowess, alone, Eternal, he bestoweth treasures.<br> Indra transcendeth both the worlds in greatness: one half of him equalleth earth and heaven.<br> 2 Yea, mighty I esteem his Godlike nature: none hindereth what he hath once determined.<br> Near and afar he spread and set the regions, and every day the Sun became apparent.<br> 3 Een now endures thine exploit of the Rivers, when, Indra, for their floods thou clavest passage.<br> Like men who sit at meat the mountains settled: by thee, Most Wise! the regions were made steadfast.<br> 4 This is the truth, none else is like thee, Indra, no God superior to thee, no mortal.<br> Thou slewest Ahi who besieged the waters, and lettest loose the streams to hurry seaward.<br> 5 Indra, thou breakest up the floods and portals on all sides, and the firmness of the mountain.<br> Thou art the King of men, of all that liveth, engendering at once Sun, Heaven, and Morning.</p>
