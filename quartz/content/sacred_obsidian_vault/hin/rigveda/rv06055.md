 <p>1. SON of Deliverance, come, bright God!<br> Let us twain go together: be our charioteer of sacrifice.<br> 2 We pray for wealth to thee most skilled of charioteers, with braided hair,<br> Lord of great riches, and our Friend.<br> 3 Bright God whose steeds are goats, thou art a stream of wealth, a treasure-heap,<br> The Friend of every pious man.<br> 4 Pūṣan, who driveth goats for steeds, the strong and Mighty, who is called<br> His Sister's lover, will we laud.<br> 5 His Mother's suitor I address. May he who loves his Sister hear,<br> Brother of Indra, and my Friend.<br> 6 May the sure-footed goats come nigh, conveying Pūṣan on his car,<br> The God who visiteth mankind.</p>
