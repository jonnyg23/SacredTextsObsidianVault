 <p>1. NOT to forsake me, I invoke this Indra girt by Maruts,<br> Lord Of magic power who rules with might.<br> 2 This Indra with his Marut Friends clave into pieces Vṛtra's bead<br> With hundred-knotted thunderbolt.<br> 3 Indra, with Marut Friends grown strong, hath rent asunder Vṛtra, and<br> Released the waters of the sea.<br> 4 This is that Indra who, begirt by Maruts, won the light of heaven<br> That he might drink the Soma juice.<br> 5 Mighty, impetuous, begirt by Maruts, him who loudly roars,<br> Indra we invocate with songs.<br> 6 Indra begirt by Maruts we invoke after the ancient plan,<br> That he may drink the Soma juice.<br> 7 O liberal Indra, Marut-girt, much-lauded Śatakratu, drink<br> The Soma at this sacrifice.<br> 8 To thee, O Indra, Marut-girt, these Soma juices, Thunderer!<br> Are offered from the heart with lauds.<br> 9 Drink, Indra, with thy Marut Friends, pressed Soma at the morning rites,<br> Whetting thy thunderbolt with strength.<br> 10 Arising in thy might, thy jaws thou shookest, Indra, having quaffed<br> The Soma which the mortar pressed.<br> 11 Indra, both worlds complained to thee when uttering thy fearful roar,<br> What time thou smotest Dasyus dead.<br> 12 From Indra have I measured out a song eight-footed with nine parts,<br> Delicate, faithful. to the Law.</p>
