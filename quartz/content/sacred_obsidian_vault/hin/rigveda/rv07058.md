 <p>1. SING to the troop that pours down rain in common, the Mighty Company of celestial nature.<br> They make the world-halves tremble with their greatness: from depths of earth and sky they reach to heaven.<br> 2 Yea, your birth, Maruts, was with wild commotion, ye who move swiftly, fierce in wrath, terrific.<br> Ye all-surpassing in your might and vigour, each looker on the light fears at your coming.<br> 3 Give ample vital power unto our princes let our fair praises gratify the Maruts.<br> As the way travelled helpeth people onward, so further us with your delightful succours.<br> 4 Your favoured singer counts his wealth by hundreds: the strong steed whom ye favour wins a thousand.<br> The Sovran whom ye aid destroys the foeman. May this your gift, ye Shakers, be distinguished.<br> 5 I call, as such, the Sons of bounteous Rudra: will not the Maruts turn again to us-ward?<br> What secret sin or open stirs their anger, that we implore the Swift Ones to forgive us.<br> 6 This eulogy of the Bounteous hath been spoken: accept, ye Maruts, this our hymn of praises.<br> Ye Bulls, keep those who hate us at a distance. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
