 <p>1. As at man's service of the Gods, Invoker, thou, Son of Strength, dost sacrifice and worship,<br> So bring for us to-day all Gods together, bring willingly the willing Gods, O Agni.<br> 2 May Agni, radiant Herald of the morning, meet to be known, accept our praise with favour.<br> Dear to all life, mid mortal men Immortal, our guest, awake at dawn, is Jātavedas.<br> 3 Whose might the very heavens regard with wonder: bright as the Sun he clothes himself with lustre.<br> He who sends forth,, Eternal Purifier, hath shattered een the ancient works of Aśna.<br> 4 Thou art a Singer, Son! our feast-companion: Agni at birth prepared his food and pathway.<br> Therefore vouchsafe us strength, O Strength-bestower. Win like a King: foes trouble not thy dwelling.<br> 5 Even he who cats his firm hard food with swiftness,and overtakes the nights as Vāyu kingdoms.<br> May we oercome those who resist thine orders, like a steed casting down the flying foemen.<br> 6 Like Sūrya with his fulgent rays, O Agni, thou overspreadest both the worlds with splendour.<br> Decked with bright colour he dispels the darkness, like Auśija, with clear flame swifily flying.<br> 7 We have elected thee as most delightful for thy beams' glow: hear our great laud, O Agni.<br> The best men praise thee as the peer of Indra in strength, mid Gods, like Viyu in thy bounty.<br> 8 Now, Agni, on the tranquil paths of riches come to us for our weal: save us from sorrow.<br> Grant chiefs and bard this boon. May we live happy, with hero children, through a hundred winters.</p>
