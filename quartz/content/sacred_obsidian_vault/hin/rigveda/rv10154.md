 <p>1. FOR some is Soma purified, some sit by sacrificial oil:<br> To those for whom the meath flows forth, even to those let him depart.<br> 2 Invincible through Fervour, those whom Fervour hath advanced to heaven,<br> Who showed great Fervour in their lives, -even to those let him depart.<br> 3 The heroes who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away,<br> Or who give guerdon thousandfold, -even to those let him depart.<br> 4 Yea, the first followers of Law, Law's pure and holy strengtheners,<br> The Fathers, Yama! Fervour-moved,even to those let him depart.<br> 5 Skilled in a thousand ways and means, the sages who protect the Sun,<br> The Ṛṣis, Yama! Fervour-moved,even to those let him depart.</p>
