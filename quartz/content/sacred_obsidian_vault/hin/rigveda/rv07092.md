O VĀYU, drinker of the pure, be near us: a thousand teams are thine, Allbounteous Giver.<br> To thee the rapture-bringing juice is offered, whose first draught, God, thou takest as thy portion.<br> 2 Prompt at the holy rites forth came the presser with Soma-draughts for Indra and for Vāyu,<br> When ministering priests with strong devotion bring to you Twain the first taste of the Soma.<br> 3 The teams wherewith thou seekest him who offers, within his home, O Viyu, to direct him,<br> Therewith send wealth: to us with full enjoyment, a hero son and gifts of kine and horses.<br> 4 Near to the Gods and making Indra joyful, devout and ofFering precious gifts to Vāyu,<br> Allied with princes, smiting down the hostile, may we with heroes conquer foes in battle.<br> 5 With thy yoked teams in hundreds and in thousands come to our sacrifice and solemn worship.<br> Come, Vāyu, make thee glad at this libation. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
