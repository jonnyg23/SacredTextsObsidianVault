 <p>1. WITH these my hymns I glorify that Indra who is alone to be invoked by mortals,<br> The Lord, the Mighty One, of manly vigour, victorious, Hero, true, and full of wisdom.<br> 2 Our sires of old,. Navagvas, sages seven, while urging him to show his might, extolled him,<br> Dwelling on heights, swift, smiting down opponents, guileless in word, and in his thoughts most mighty.<br> 3 We seek that Indra to obtain his riches that bring much food, and men, and store of heroes.<br> Bring us, Lord of Bay Steeds, to make us joyful, celestial wealth, abundant, undecaying.<br> 4 Tell thou us this, if at thy hand aforetime the earlier singers have obtained good fortune,<br> What is thy share and portion, Strong Subduer, Asura-slayer, rich, invoked of many?<br> 5 He who for car-borne Indra, armed with thunder, hath a hymn, craving, deeply-piercing, fluent,<br> Who sends a song effectual, firmly-grasping, and strength-bestowing, he comes near the mighty.<br> 6 Strong of thyself, thou by this art hast shattered, with thought-swift Parvata, him who waxed against thee,<br> And, Mightiest! roaring! boldly rent in pieces things that were firmly fixed and never shaken.<br> 7 Him will we fit for you with new devotion, the strongest Ancient One, in ancient manner.<br> So may that Indra, boundless, faithful Leader, conduct us oer all places hard to traverse.<br> 8 Thou for the people who oppress hast kindled the earthly firmament and that of heaven.<br> With heat, O Bull, on every side consume them: heat earth and flood for him who hates devotion.<br> 9 Of all the Heavenly Folk, of earthly creatures thou art the King, O God of splendid aspect.<br> In thy right hand, O Indra, grasp die thunder: Eternal! thou destroyest all enchantments.<br> 10 Give us confirmed prosperity, O Indra, vast and exhaustless for the foe's subduing.<br> Strengthen therewith the Ārya's hate and Dāsa's, and let the arms of Nahusas be mighty.<br> 11 Come with thy team which brings all blessings hither, Disposer, much-invoked, exceeding holy.<br> Thou whom no fiend, no God can stay or hinder, come swittly with these Steeds in my direction.</p>
