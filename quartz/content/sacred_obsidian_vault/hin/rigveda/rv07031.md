 <p>1. SING ye a song, to make him glad, to Indra, Lord of Tawny Steeds,<br> The Soma-drinker, O my friends.<br> 2 To him the Bounteous say the laud, and let us glorify, as men May do, the Giver of true gifts.<br> 3 O Indra, Lord of boundless might, for us thou winnest strength and kine,<br> Thou winnest gold for us, Good Lord.<br> 4 Faithful to thee we loudly sing, heroic Indra, songs to thee: Mark, O Good Lord, this act of ours.<br> 5 Give us not up to man's reproach, to foeman's hateful calumny: In thee alone is all my strength.<br> 6 Thou art mine ample coat of mail, my Champion, Vṛtra-Slayer, thou:<br> With thee for Friend I brave the foe.<br> 7 Yea, great art thou whose conquering might two independent Powers confess.<br> The Heaven, O India, and the Earth.<br> 8 So let the voice surround thee, which attends the Maruts on their way,<br> Reaching thee with the rays of light.<br> 9 Let the ascending drops attain to thee, the Wondrous God, in heaven:<br> Let all the folk bow down to thee.<br> 10 Bring to the Wise, the Great, who waxeth mighty, your offerings, and make ready your devotion;<br> To many clans he goeth, man's controller.<br> 11 For Indra, the sublime, the far-pervading, have singers generated prayer and praises:<br> The sages never violate his statutes.<br> 12 The choirs have stablished Indra King for ever, for victory, him whose anger is resistless:<br> And, for the Bays' Lord, strengthened those he loveth.</p>
