 <p>1. THE Bull of men, who cherishes all people, King of the Races, Indra, called of many,<br> Fame-loving, praised, hither to me with succour turn having yoked both vigorous Bay Horses!<br> 2 Thy mighty Stallions, yoked by prayer, O Indra, thy. Coursers to thy mighty chariot harnessed,<br> Ascend thou these, and borne by them come hither: with Soma juice outpoured, Indra, we call thee.<br> 3 Ascend thy mighty car: the mighty Soma is poured for thee and sweets are sprinkled round us.<br> Come down to us-ward, Bull of human races, come, having harnessed them, with strong Bay Horses.<br> 4 Here is God-reaching sacrifice, here the victim; here, Indra, are the prayers, here is the Soma.<br> Strewn is the sacred grass: come hither, Śakra; seat thee and drink: unyoke thy two Bay Coursers.<br> 5 Come to us, Indra, come thou highly lauded to the devotions of the singer Māna.<br> Singing, may we find early through thy succour, may we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
