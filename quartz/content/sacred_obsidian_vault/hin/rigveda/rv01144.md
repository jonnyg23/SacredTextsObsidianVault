 <p>1. THE Priest goes forth to sacrifice, with wondrous power sending aloft the hymn of glorious brilliancy.<br> He moves to meet the ladles turning to the right, which are the first to kiss the place where he abides.<br> 2 To him sang forth the flowing streams of Holy Law, encompassed in the home and birth-place of the God.<br> He, when he dwelt extended in the waters lap, absorbed those Godlike powers for which he is adored.<br> 3 Seeking in course altern to reach the selfsame end the two copartners strive to win this beauteous form.<br> Like Bhaga must he be duly invoked by us, as he who drives the car holds fast the horse's reins.<br> 4 He whom the two copartners with observance tend, the pair who dwell together in the same abode,<br> By night as in the day the grey one was born young, passing untouched by eld through many an age of man.<br> 5 Him the ten fingers, the devotions, animate: we mortals call on him a God to give us help.<br> He speeds over the sloping surface of the land: new deeds hath he performed with those who gird him round.<br> 6 For, Agni, like a herdsman, thou by thine own might rulest oer all that is in heaven and on the earth;<br> And these two Mighty Ones, bright, golden closely joined, rolling them round are come unto thy sacred grass.<br> 7 Agni, accept with joy, be glad in this our prayer, joy-giver, self-sustained, strong, born of Holy Law!<br> For fair to see art thou turning to every side, pleasant to look on as a dwelling filled with food.</p>
