 <p>1. O INDRA, Vṛtra-slayer, none is better, mightier than thou:<br> Verily there is none like thee.<br> 2 Like chariot-wheels these people all together follow after thee:<br> Thou ever art renowned as Great.<br> 3 Not even all the gathered Gods conquered thee, Indra, in the war,<br> When thou didst lengthen days by night.<br> 4 When for the sake of those oppressed, and Kutsa as he battled,<br> Thou stolest away the Sun's car-wheel.<br> 5 When, fighting singly, Indra. thou oercamest all the furious Gods, thou slewest those who strove with thee.<br> 6 When also for a mortal man, Indra, thou speddest forth the Sun,<br> And holpest Etaśa with might.<br> 7 What? Vṛtra-slayer, art not thou, Maghavan, fiercest in thy wrath?<br> So hast thou quelled the demon too.<br> 8 And this heroic deed of might thou, Indra, also hast achieved,<br> That thou didst smite to death the Dame, Heaven's Daughter, meditating ill.<br> 9 Thou, Indra, Mighty One, didst crush Uṣas, though Daughter of the Sky.<br> When lifting up herself in pride.<br> 10 Then from her chariot Uṣas fled, affrighted, from her ruined car.<br> When the strong God had shattered it.<br> 11 So there this car of Uṣas lay, broken to pieces, in Vipāś,<br> And she herself fled far away.<br> 12 Thou, Indra, didst. with magic power resist the overflowing stream<br> Who spread her waters oer the land.<br> 13 Valiantly didst thou seize and take the store which Śuṣṇa had amassed,<br> When thou didst crush his fortresses.<br> 14 Thou, Indra, also smotest down Kulitara's son Śambara,<br> The Dāsa, from the lofty hill.<br> 15 Of Dāsa Varcin's thou didst slay the hundred thousand and the five,<br> Crushed like the fellies, of a car.<br> 16 So Indra, Lord of Heroes, Powers, caused the unwedded damsel's son,<br> The castaway, to share the lauds.<br> 17 So sapient Indra, Lord of Might, brought Turvaśa and Yadu, those<br> Who feared the flood, in safety oer.<br> 18 Arṇa and Citraratha, both Āryas, thou, Indra, slewest swift,<br> On yonder side of Sarayu,<br> 19 Thou, Vṛtra-slayer, didst conduct those two forlorn, the blind, the lame.<br> None may attain this bliss of thine.<br> 20 For Divodāsa, him who brought oblations, Indra overthrew<br> A hundred fortresses of stone.<br> 21 The thirty thousand Dāsas he with magic power and weapons sent<br> To slumber, for Dabhīti's sake.<br> 22 As such, O Vṛtra-slayer, thou art general Lord of kine for all,<br> Thou Shaker of all things that be.<br> 23 Indra, whatever deed of might thou hast this day to execute,<br> None be there now to hinder it.<br> 24 O Watchful One, may Aryaman the God give thee all goodly things.<br> May Pūṣan, Bhaga, and the God Karūḷatī give all things fair.</p>
