 <p>1. THE Night retireth from the Dawn her Sister; the Dark one yieldeth to the Red her pathway.<br> Let us invoke you rich in steeds and cattle - by day and night keep far from us the arrow.<br> 2 Bearing rich treasure in your car, O Aśvins, come to the mortal who presents oblation.<br> Keep at a distance penury and sickness; Lovers of Sweetness, day and night preserve us.<br> 3 May your strong horses, seeking bliss, bring hither your chariot at the earliest flush of morning.<br> With coursers yoked by Law drive hither, Aśvins, your car whose reins are light, laden with treasure.<br> 4 The chariot, Princes, that conveys you, moving at daylight, triple-seated, fraught with riches,<br> Even with this come unto us, Nāsatyas, that laden with all food it may approach us.<br> 5 Ye freed Cyavāna from old age and weakness: ye brought the courser fleet of food to Pedu.<br> Ye rescued Atri from distress and darkness, and loosed for Jāhuṣa the bonds that bound him.<br> 6 This is the thought, this is the song, O Aśvins: accept this hymn of ours, ye Steers, With favour.<br> May these our prayers addressed to you come nigh you. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.</p>
