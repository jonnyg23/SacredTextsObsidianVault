 <p>1. Him, messenger of earth and head of heaven, Agni Vaiśvānara, born in holy Order,<br> The Sage, the King, the guest of men, a vessel fit for their mouths, the Gods have generated.<br> 2 Him have they praised, mid-point of sacrifices, great cistern of libations, seat of riches.<br> Vaiśvānara, conveyer of oblations, ensign of worship, have the Gods engendered.<br> 3 From thee, O Agni, springs the mighty singer, from thee come heroes who subdue the foeman.<br> O King, Vaiśvānara, bestow thou on us excellent treasures worthy to belonged fo r.<br> 4 To thee, Immortal! when to life thou springest, all the Gods sing for joy as to their infant.<br> They by thy mental powers were made immortal, Vaiśvānara, when thou shonest from thy Parents.<br> 5 Agni Vaiśvānara, no one hath ever resisted these thy mighty ordinances,<br> When thou, arising from thy Parents' bosom, foundest the light for days' appointed courses.<br> 6 The summits of the heaven are traversed through and through by the Immortal's light, Vaiśvānara's brilliancy.<br> All creatures in existence rest upon his head. The Seven swift-flowing Streams have grown like branches forth,<br> 7 Vaiśvānara, who measured out the realms of air, Sage very wise who made the lucid spheres of heaven,<br> The Undeceivable who spread out all the worlds, keeper is he and guard of immortality.</p>
