 <p>1. By Manu's law was born this Agni, Priest most skilled, born for the holy work of those who yearn therefore, yea, born for his own holy work.<br> All ear to him who seeks his love and wealth to him who strives for fame,<br> Priest neer deceived, he sits in Iḷā's holy place, girt round in Iḷā's holy place.<br> 2 We call that perfecter of worship by the path or sacrifice; with reverence rich in offerings, with worship rich in offerings.<br> Through presentation of our food he grows not old in this his from;<br> The God whom Mātariśvan brought from far away, for Manu brought from far away.<br> 3 In ordered course forthwith he traverses the earth, swift-swallowing, bellowing Steer, bearing the genial seed, bearing the seed and bellowing.<br> Observant with a hundred eyes the God is conqueror in the wood:<br> Agni, who hath his seat in broad plains here below, and in the high lands far away.<br> 4 That Agni, wise High-Priest, in every house takes thought for sacrifice and holy service, yea, takes thought, with mental power, for sacrifice.<br> Disposer, he with mental power shows all things unto him who strives;<br> Whence he was born a guest enriched with holy oil, born as Ordainer and as Priest.<br> 5 When through his power and in his strong prevailing flames the Maruts gladdening boons mingle with Agni's roar, boons gladdening for the active One,<br> Then he accelerates the gift, and by the greatness of his wealth,<br> Shall rescue us from overwhelming misery, from curse and overwhelming woe.<br> 6 Vast, universal, good he was made messenger; the speeder with his right hand hath not loosed his hold, through love of fame not loosed his hold.<br> He bears oblations to the Gods for whosoever supplicates.<br> Agni bestows a blessing on each pious man, and opens wide the doors for him.<br> 7 That Agni hath been set most kind in camp of men, in sacrifice like a Lord victorious, like a dear Lord in sacred rites.<br> His are the oblations of mankind when offered up at Iḷā's place.<br> He shall preserve us from Varuṇa's chastisement, yea, from the great God's chastisement.<br> 8 Agni the Priest they supplicate to grant them wealth: him, dear, most thoughtful, have they made their messenger, him, offering-bearer have they made,<br> Beloved of all, who knoweth all, the Priest, the Holy one, the Sage<br> Him, Friend, for help, the Gods when they are fain for wealth, him, Friend, with hymns, when fain for wealth.</p>
