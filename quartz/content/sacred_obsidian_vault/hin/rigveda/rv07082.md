 <p>1. GRANT us your strong protection, IndraVaruṇa, our people, and our family, for sacrifice.<br> May we subdue in fight our evil-hearted foes, him who attacks the man steadfast in lengthened rites.<br> 2 O Indra-Varuṇa, mighty and very rich One of you is called Monarch and One Autocrat.<br> All Gods in the most lofty region of the air have, O ye Steers, combined all power and might in you.<br> 3 Ye with your strength have pierced the fountains of the floods: the Sun have ye brought forward as the Lord in heaven.<br> Cheered by this magic draught ye, Indra-Varuṇa, made the dry places stream, made songs of praise flow forth.<br> 4 In battels and in frays we ministering priests, kneeling upon our knees for furtherance of our weal,<br> Invoke you, only you, the Lords of twofold wealth, you prompt to hear, we bards, O Indra-Varuṇa.<br> 5 O Indra-Varuṇa, as ye created all these creatures of the world by your surpassing might,<br> In peace and quiet Mitra waits on Varuṇa, the Other, awful, with the Maruis seeks renown.<br> 6 That Varuṇa's high worth may shine preeminent, these Twain have measured each his proper power and might.<br> The One subdueth the destructive enemy; the Other with a few furthereth many a man.<br> 7 No trouble, no misfortune, Indra-Varuṇa, no woe from any side assails the mortal man<br> Whose sacrifice, O Gods, ye visit and enjoy: neer doth the crafty guile of mortal injure him.<br> 8 With your divine protection, Heroes, come to us: mine invncation hear, if ye be pleased therewith.<br> Bestow ye upon us, O Indra-Varuṇa, your friendship and your kinship and your favouring grace.<br> 9 In battle after battle, Indra-Varuṇa, be ye our Champions, ye who are the peoples' strength,<br> When both opposing bands invoke you for the fight, and men that they may gain offspring and progeny.<br> 10 May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great shelter spreading far.<br> We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise, the God who strengthens Law.</p>
