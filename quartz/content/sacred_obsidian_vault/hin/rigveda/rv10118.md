 <p>1. AGNI, refulgent among men thou slayest the devouring fiend,<br> Bright Ruler in thine own abode.<br> 2 Thou springest up when worshipped well the drops of butter are thy joy<br> When ladies are brought near to thee.<br> 3 Honoured with gifts he shines afar, Agni adorable with song:<br> The dripping ladle balms his face.<br> 4 Agni with honey in his mouth, honoured with gifts, is balmed with oil,<br> Refulgent in his wealth of light.<br> 5 Praised by our hymns thou kindlest thee, Oblation-bearer, for the Gods<br> As such do mortals call on thee.<br> 6 To that Immortal Agni pay worship with oil, ye mortal men,<br> Lord of the house, whom none deceives.<br> 7 O Agni, burn the Rākṣasas with thine unconquerable flame<br> Shine guardian of Eternal Law.<br> 8 So, Agni, with thy glowing face burn fierce against the female fiends,<br> Shining among Uruksayas.<br> 9 Uruksayas have kindled thee, Oblation-bearer, thee, with hymns.<br> Best Worshipper among mankind.</p>
