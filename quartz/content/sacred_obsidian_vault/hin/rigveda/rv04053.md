 <p>1. OF Savitar the God, the sapient Asura, we crave this great gift which is worthy of our choice,<br> Wherewith he freely grants his worshiper defence. This with his rays the Great God hath vouchsafed to us.<br> 2 Sustainer of the heaven, Lord of the whole world's life, the Sage, he putteth on his golden-coloured mail.<br> Clear-sighted, spreading far, filling the spacious realm, Savitar hath brought forth bliss that deserveth laud.<br> 3 He hath filled full the regions of the heaven and earth: the God for his own strengthening waketh up the hymn.<br> Savitar hath stretched out his arms to cherish life, producing with his rays and lulling all that moves.<br> 4 Lighting all living creatures, neer to be deceived, Savitar, God, protects each holy ordinance.<br> He hath stretched out his arms to all the folk of earth, and, with his laws observed, rules his own mighty course.<br> 5 Savitar thrice surrounding with his mightiness mid-air, three regions, and the triple sphere of light,<br> Sets the three heavens in motion and the threefold earth, and willingly protects us with his triple law.<br> 6 Most gracious God, who brings to life and lulls to rest, he who controls the world, what moves not and what moves,<br> May he vouchsafe us shelter,Savitar the God,for tranquil life, with triple bar against distress.<br> 7 With the year's seasons hath Savitar, God, come nigh: may he prosper our home, give food and noble sons.<br> May he invigorate us through the days and nights, and may he send us opulence with progeny.</p>
