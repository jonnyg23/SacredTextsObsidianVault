THAT Indra is our youthful Friend, who with his trusty guidance led<br> Turvaśa, Yadu from afar.<br> 2 Even to the dull and uninspired Indra, gives vital power, and wins<br> Even with slow steed the offered prize.<br> 3 Great are his ways of guiding us, andṅanilbld are Ins eulogies:<br> His kind protections never fail.<br> 4 Friends, sing your psalm and offer praise to him to whom the prayer is brought:<br> For our great Providence is he.<br> 5 Thou, Slaughterer of Vṛtra, art Guardian and Friend of one and two,<br> Yea, of a man like one of us.<br> 6 Beyond men's hate thou leadest us, and givest cause to sing thy praise:<br> Good hero art thou called by men.<br> 7 I call with hymns, as twere a cow to milk, the Friend who merits praise,<br> The Brahman who accepts the prayer.<br> 8 Him in whose hands they say are stored all treasures from the days of old,<br> The Hero, conquering in the fight.<br> 9 Lord of Strength, Caster of the Stone, destroy the firm forts built by men,<br> And foil their arts, unbending God!<br> 10 Thee, thee as such, O Lord of Power, O Indra, Soma-drinker, true,<br> We, fain for glory, have invoked.<br> 11 Such as thou wast of old, and art now to be called on when the prize<br> lies ready, listen to our call.<br> 12 With hymns and coursers we will gain, Indra, through thee, both steeds and spoil<br> Most glorious, and the proffered prize.<br> 13 Thou, Indra, Lover of the Song, whom men must stir to help, hast been<br> Great in the contest for the prize.<br> 14 Slayer of foes, whatever aid of thine imparts the swiftest course,<br> With that impel our car to speed.<br> 15 As skilfullest of those who drive the chariot, with our art and aim,<br> O Conqueror, win the proffered prize.<br> 16 Praise him who, Matchless and Alone, was born the Lord of living men,<br> Most active, with heroic soul.<br> 17 Thou who hast been the singers' Friend, a Friend auspicious with thine aid,<br> As such, O Indra, favour us.<br> 18 Grasp in thine arms the thunderbolt, O Thunder-armed, to slay the fiends:<br> Mayst thou subdue the foemen's host.<br> 19 I call the ancient Friend, allied with wealth, who speeds the lowly man,<br> Him to whom chiefly prayer is brought.<br> 20 For he alone is Lord of all the treasures of the earth: he speeds<br> Hither, chief Lover of the Song.<br> 21 So with thy yoked teams satisfy our wish with power and wealth in steeds<br> And cattle, boldly, Lord of kine!<br> 22 Sing this, what time the ' juice is pressed, to him your Hero, Much-invoked,<br> To please him as a mighty Steer.<br> 23 He, Excellent, withholdeth not his gift of power and wealth in kine,<br> When he hath listened to our songs.<br> 24 May he with might unclose for us the cow's stall, whosesoeer it be,<br> To which the Dasyu-slayer goes.<br> 25 O Indra Śatakratu, these our songs have called aloud to thee,<br> Like mother cows to meet their calves.<br> 26 Hard is thy love to win: thou art a Steer to him who longs for steers:<br> Be to one craving steeds a Steed.<br> 27 Delight thee with the juice we pour for thine own great munificence:<br> Yield not thy singer to reproach.<br> 28 These songs with every draught we pour come, Lover of the Song, to thee,<br> As milch-kine hasten to their young<br> 29 To thee most oft invoked, amid the many singers' rivalry<br> Who beg with all their might for wealth.<br> 30 Nearest and most attractive may our laud, O Indra come to thee.<br> Urge thou us on to ample wealth.<br> 31 Brbu hath set himself above the Paṇis, oer their highest head,<br> Like the wide bush on Gan!gā's bank.<br> 32 He whose good bounty, thousandfold, swift as the rushing of the wind,<br> Suddenly offers as a gift.<br> 33 So all our singers ever praise the pious Brbu's noble deed,<br> Chief, best to give his thousands, best to give a thousand liberal gifts.</p>
