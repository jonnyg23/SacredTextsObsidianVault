 <p>1. MAY Indra come to us, he who knows rightly to give forth treasures from his store of riches.<br> Even as a thirsty steer who roams the deserts may he drink eagerly the milked-out Soma.<br> 2 Lord of Bay Horses, Hero, may the Soma rise to thy cheeks and jaws like mountain-ridges.<br> May we, O King, as he who driveth coursers, all joy in thee with hymns, invoked of many!<br> 3 Invoked of many, Caster of the Stone my heart quakes like a rolling wheel for fear of penury.<br> Shall not Puruvasu the singer give thee praise, O ever-prospering Maghavan, mounted on thy car?<br> 4 Like the press-stone is this thy praiser, Indra. Loudly he lifts his voice with strong endeavour.<br> With thy left hand, O Maghavan, give us riches: with thy right, Lord of Bays, be not reluctant.<br> 5 May the strong Heaven make thee the Strong wax stronger: Strong, thou art borne by thy two strong Bay Horses.<br> So, fair of cheek, with mighty chariot, mighty, uphold us, strong-willed, thunderarmed, in battle.<br> 6 Maruts, let all the people in obeisance bow down before this youthful Srutaratha,<br> Who, rich in steeds, gave me two dark red horses together with three hundred head of cattle.</p>
