 <p>1. DRINK, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer thee with our milky draught.<br> Be, for our weal, our Friend and sharer of the feast, and let thy wisdom guard us well.<br> 2 In thy kind grace and favour may we still be strong: expose us not to foe's attack.<br> With manifold assistance guard and succour us, and bring us to felicity.<br> 3 May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast abundant wealth.<br> Men skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have sung them with their lauds to thee.<br> 4 He, with his might enhanced by Ṛṣis thousandfold, hath like an ocean spread himself.<br> His majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power where holy singers rule.<br> 5 Indra for worship of the Gods, Indra while sacrifice proceeds,<br> Indra, as worshippers in battle-shock, we call, Indra that we may win the spoil.<br> 6 With might hath Indra spread out heaven and earth, with power hath Indra lighted up the Sun.<br> In Indra are all creatures closely held; in him meet the distilling Soma-drops.<br> 7 Men with their lauds are urging thee, Indra, to drink the Soma first.<br> The Ṛbhus in accord have lifted up their voice, and Rudras sung thee as the first.<br> 8 Indra increased his manly strength at sacrifice, in the wild rapture of this juice.<br> And living men to-day, even as of old, sing forth their praises to his majesty.<br> 9 I crave of thee that hero strength, that thou mayst first regard this prayer,<br> Wherewith thou holpest Bhṛgu and the Yatis and Praskaṇva when the prize was staked.<br> 10 Wherewith thou sentest mighty waters to the sea, that, Indra, is thy manly strength.<br> For ever unattainable is this power of him to whom the worlds have cried aloud.<br> 11 Help us, O Indra, when we pray to thee for wealth and hero might.<br> First help thou on to strength the man who strives to win, and aid our laud, O Ancient One.<br> 12 Help for us, Indra, as thou holpest Paura once, this man's devotions bent on gain.<br> Help, as thou gavest Ruśama and Śyāvaka and Svarṇara and Kṛpa aid.<br> 13 What newest of imploring prayers shall, then, the zealous mortal sing?<br> For have not they who laud his might, and Indra-power won for themselves the light of heaven?<br> 14 When shall they keep the Law and praise thee mid the Gods? Who counts as Ṛṣi and as sage?<br> When ever wilt thou, Indra Maghavan, come nigh to presser's or to praiser's call?<br> 15 These songs of ours exceeding sweet, these hymns of praise ascend to thee,<br> Like ever-conquering chariots that display their strength, gain wealth, and give unfailing aid.<br> 16 The Bhṛgus are like Suns, like Kaṇvas, and have gained all that their thoughts were bent upon.<br> The living men of Priyamedha's race have sung exalting Indra with their lauds.<br> 17 Best slayer of the Vṛtras, yoke thy Bay Steeds, Indra, from afar.<br> Come with the High Ones hither, Maghavan, to us, Mighty, to drink the Soma juice.<br> 18 For these, the bards and singers, have cried out to thee with prayer, to gain the sacrifice.<br> As such, O Maghavan, Indra, who lovest song, even as a lover bear my call.<br> 19 Thou from the lofty plains above, O Indra, hurledst Vṛtra down.<br> Thou dravest forth the kine of guileful Mṛgaya and Arbuda from the mountain's hold.<br> 20 Bright were the flaming fires, the Sun gave forth his shine, and Soma, Indra's juice, shone clear.<br> Indra, thou blewest the great Dragon from the air: men must regard that valorous deed.<br> 21 The fairest courser of them all, who runneth on as twere to heaven.<br> Which Indra and the Maruts gave, and Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇ.<br> 22 To me hath Pākasthāman given, a ruddy horse, good at the pole,<br> Filling is girth and rousing wealth;<br> 23 Compared with whom no other ten strong coursers, harnessed to the pole,<br> Bear Tugrya to his dwelling place.<br> 24 Raiment is body, food is life, and healing ointment giveth strength.<br> As the free-handed giver of the ruddy steed, I have named Pākasthāman fourth.</p>
