 <p>1. To thee the Mighty One I bring this mighty hymn, for thy desire hath been gratified by my laud.<br> In Indra, yea in him victorious through his strength, the Gods have joyed at feast and when the Soma flowed.<br> 2 The Seven Rivers bear his glory far and wide, and heaven and sky and earth display his comely form.<br> The Sun and Moon in change alternate run their course, that we, O Indra, may behold and may have faith.<br> 3 Maghavan, grant us that same car to bring us spoil, thy conquering car in which we joy in shock of fight.<br> Thou, Indra, whom our hearts praise highly in the war, grant shelter, Maghavan, to us who love thee well.<br> 4 Encourage thou our side in every fight: may we, with thee for our ally, conquer the foeman's host.<br> Indra, bestow on us joy and felicity break down, O Maghavan, the vigour of our foes.<br> 5 For here in divers ways these men invoking thee, holder of treasures, sing hymns to win thine aid.<br> Ascend the car that thou mayest bring spoil to us, for, Indra, thy fixt winneth the victory.<br> 6 His arms win kine, his power is boundless in each act best, with a hundred helps, waker of battle's din<br> Is Indra: none may rival him in mighty strength. Hence, eager for the spoil the people call on him.<br> 7 Thy glory, Maghavan, exceeds a hundred yea, more than a hundred, than a thousand mid the folk,<br> The great bowl hath inspirited thee boundlessly: so mayst thou slay the Vṛtras, breaker-down of forts!<br> 8 Of thy great might there is a three counterpart, the three earths, Lord men and the three realms of light.<br> Above this whole world, Indra, thou hast waxen great: without a foe art thou, nature, from of old.<br> 9 We invocate thee first among the Deities: thou hast become a mighty Conquer in fight.<br> May Indra fill with spirit this our singer's heart, and make our car impetuous, foremost in attack.<br> 10 Thou hast prevailed, and hast not kept the booty back, in trifling battles in those of great account.<br> We make thee keen, the Mighty One, succour us: inspire us, Maghavan, when we defy the foe.<br> 11 May Indra evermore be our Protector, and unimperilled may we win the booty.<br> This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
