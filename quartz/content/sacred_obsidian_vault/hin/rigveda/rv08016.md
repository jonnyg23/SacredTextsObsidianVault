 <p>1. PRAISE Indra whom our songs must laud, sole Sovran of mankind, the Chief<br> Most liberal who controlleth men.<br> 2 In whom the hymns of praise delight, and all the glory-giving songs.<br> Like the floods' longing for the sea.<br> 3 Him I invite with eulogy, best King, effective in the fight,<br> Strong for the gain of mighty spoil.<br> 4 Whose perfect ecstasies are wide, profound, victorious, and give<br> joy in the field where heroes win.<br> 5 Him, when the spoils of war are staked, men call to be their advocate:<br> They who have Indra win the day.<br> 6 Men honour him with stirring songs and magnify with solemn rites:<br> Indra is he who giveth case.<br> 7 Indra is priest and Ṛṣi, he is much invoked by many men,<br> And mighty by his mighty powers.<br> 8 Meet to be lauded and invoked, true Hero with his deeds of might,<br> Victorious even when alone.<br> 9 The men, the people magnify that Indra with their Slina. songs,<br> With hymns and sacred eulogies<br> 10 Him who advances them to wealth, sends light to lead them in the war,<br> And quells their foemen in the fray.<br> 11 May he, the saviour much-invoked, may Indra bear us in a ship<br> Safely beyond all enemies.<br> 12 As such, O Indra, honour us with gifts of booty, further us,<br> And lead us to felicity.</p>
