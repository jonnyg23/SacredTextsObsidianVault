 <p>1. HE like a bull with sharpened horns, terrific, singly excites and agitates all the people:<br> Thou givest him who largely pours libations his goods who pours not, for his own possession.<br> 2 Thou, verily, Indra, gavest help to Kutsa, willingly giving car to him in battle,<br> When, aiding Ārjuneya, thou subduedst to him both Kuyava and the Dāsa Śuṣṇa.<br> 3 O Bold One, thou with all thine aids hast boldly holpen Sudās whose offerings were accepted,<br> Pūru in winning land and slaying foemen, and Trasadasyu son of Purukutsa.<br> 4 At the Gods banquet, hero-souled! with Heroes, Lord of Bay Steeds, thou slewest many foemen.<br> Thou sentest in swift death to sleep the Dasyu, both Cumuri and Dhuni, for Dabhīti.<br> 5 These were thy mighty powers that, Thunder-wielder, thou swiftly crushedst nine-and-ninety castles:<br> Thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught; thou slewest Namuci, thou slewest Vṛtra.<br> 6 Old are the blessings, Indra, which thou gavest Sudās the worshipper who brought oblations.<br> For thee, the Strong, I yoke thy strong Bay Horses: may our prayers reach thee and win strength, Most Mighty!<br> 7 Give us not up, Lord of Bay Horses, Victor, in this thine own assembly, to the wicked.<br> Deliver us with true and faithful succours: dear may we be to thee among the princes.<br> 8 May we men, Maghavan, the friends thou lovest, near thee be joyful under thy protection.<br> Fain to fulfil the wish of Atithigva humble. the pride of Turvaśa and Yadva.<br> 9 Swiftly, in truth, O Maghavan, about thee men skilled in hymning sing their songs and praises. '<br> Elect us also into their assembly who by their calls on thee despoiled the niggards.<br> 10 Thine are these lauds, O manliest of heroes, lauds which revert to us and give us riches.<br> Favour these, Indra, when they fight with faemen, as Friend and Hero and the heroes' Helper.<br> 11 Now, lauded for thine aid, Heroic Indra, sped by our prayer, wax mighty in thy body.<br> Apportion to us strength and habitations. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings.</p>
