 <p>1. FULL wise is he who hath discerned: let him speak to us of the Gods,<br> The man whose praise-songs Varuṇa the beautiful, or Mitra, loves.<br> 2 For they are Kings of noblest might, of glorious fame most widely spread;<br> Lords of the brave, who strengthen Law, the Holy Ones with every race.<br> 3 Approaching you with prayer for aid, together I address you first<br> We who have good steeds call on you, Most Sage, to give us strength besides.<br> 4 Een out of misery Mitra gives a way to dwelling at our case,<br> For he who worships hath the grace of Mitra, fighter in the van. '<br> 5 In Mitra's shelter that extends to utmost distance may we dwell,<br> Unmenaced, guarded by the care, ever as sons of Varuṇa.<br> 6 Ye, Mitra, urge this people on, and to one end direct their ways.<br> Neglect not ye the wealthy chiefs, neglect not us the Ṛṣis: be our guardians when ye quaff the milk.</p>
