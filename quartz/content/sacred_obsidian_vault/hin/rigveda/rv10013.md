 <p>1. I YOKE with prayer your ancient inspiration: may the laud rise as on the prince's pathway.<br> All Sons of Immortality shall hear it, all the possessors of celestial natures.<br> 2 When speeding ye came nigh us like twin sisters, religious-hearted votaries brought you forward.<br> Take your place, ye who know your proper station: be near, be very near unto our Soma.<br> 3 Five paces have I risen from Earth. I follow her who hath four feet with devout observance.<br> This by the Sacred Syllable have I measured: I purify in the central place of Order,<br> 4 He, for God's sake, chose death to be his portion. He chose not, for men's good, a life eternal<br> They sacrificed Bṛhaspati the Ṛṣi. Yama delivered up his own dear body.<br> 5 The Seven flow to the Youth on whom the Maruts wait: the Sons unto the Father brought the sacrifice.<br> Both these are his, as his they are the Lords of both: both toil; belonging unto both they prosper well.</p>
