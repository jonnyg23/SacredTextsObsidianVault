 <p>1. BOUNDLESS and wasting not, the heavenly food of Gods goes to the foeless One, doer of wondrous deeds.<br> Press out, make ready, offer gifts with special zeal to him whom many laud, accepter of the prayer.<br> 2 He who filled full his belly with the Soma's juice, Maghavan, was delighted with the meath's sweet draught,<br> When Uśanā, that he might slay the monstrous beast, gave him the mighty weapon with a thousand points.<br> 3 Illustrious is the man whoever presseth out Soma for him in sunshine or in cloud and rain.<br> The mighty Maghavan who is the sage's Friend advanceth more and more his beauteous progeny.<br> 4 The Strong God doth not flee away from him whose sire, whose mother or whose brother he hath done to death.<br> He, the Avenger, seeketh this man's offered gifts: this God, the source of riches, doth not flee from sin.<br> 5 He seeks no enterprise with five or ten to aid, nor stays with him who pours no juice though prospering well.<br> The Shaker conquers or slays in this way or that, and to the pious gives a stable full of kine.<br> 6 Exceeding strong in war he stays the chariot wheel, and, hating him who pours not, prospers him who pours.<br> Indra the terrible, tamer of every man, as Ārya leads away the Dāsa at his will.<br> 7 He gathers up for plunder all the niggards gear: excellent wealth he gives to him who offers gifts.<br> Not even in wide stronghold may all the folk stand firm who have provoked to anger his surpassing might.<br> 8 When Indra Maghavan hath marked two wealthy men fighting for beauteous cows with all their followers,<br> He who stirs all things takes one as his close ally, and, Shaker, with his Heroes, sends the kine to him.<br> 9 Agni! I laud the liberal Agnivesi, Satri the type and standard of the pious.<br> May the collected waters yield him plenty, and his be powerful and bright dominion.</p>
