 <p>1 WORSHIP the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras, the Ādityas, all<br> Who spring from Manu, those who know fair rites, who pour their blessings down.<br> 2 Agni, the Gods who understand give ear unto the worshipper:<br> Lord of Red Steeds, who lovest song, bring thou those Three-and-Thirty Gods.<br> 3 O Jātavedas, great in act, hearken thou to Praskaṇva's call,<br> As Priyamedha erst was heard, Atri, Virūpa, Aṅgiras.<br> 4 The sons of Priyamedha skilled in lofty praise have called for help<br> On Agni who with fulgent flame is Ruler of all holy rites.<br> 5 Hear thou, invoked with holy oil, bountiful giver of rewards,<br> These eulogies, whereby the sons of Kaṇva call thee to their aid.<br> 6 O Agni, loved by many, thou of fame most wondrous, in their homes<br> Men call on thee whose hair is flame, to be the bearer of their gifts.<br> 7 Thee, Agni, best to find out wealth, most widely famous, quick to hear,<br> Singers have stablished in their rites Herald and ministering Priest.<br> 8 Singers with Soma pressed have made thee, Agni, hasten to the feast,<br> Great light to mortal worshipper, what time they bring the sacred gift.<br> 9 Good, bounteous, Son of Strength, this day seat here on sacred grass the Gods<br> Who come at early morn, the host of heaven, to drink the Soma juice<br> 10 Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host:<br> Here stands the Soma, bounteous Gods drink this expressed ere yesterday.</p>
