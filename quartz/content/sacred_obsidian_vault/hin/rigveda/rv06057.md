 <p>1. INDRA and Pūṣan will we call for friend ship and prosperity<br> And for the winning of the spoil.<br> 2 One by the Soma sits to drink juice which the mortar hath expressed:<br> The other longs for curd and meal.<br> 3 Goats are the team that draws the one: the other hath Bay Steeds at hand;<br> With both of these he slays the fiends.<br> 4 When Indra, wondrous strong, brought down the streams, the mighty waterfloods,<br> Pūṣan was standing by his side.<br> 5 To this, to Pūṣan's favouring love, and Indra's, may we closely cling,<br> As to a tree's extended bough.<br> 6 As one who drives a car draws in his reins, may we draw Pūṣan near,<br> And Indra, for our great success.</p>
