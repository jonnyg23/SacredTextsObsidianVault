 <p>1. WINNER of thousands, kindled, thou shinest a God with Gods to-day.<br> Bear out oblations, envoy, Sage.<br> 2 Child of Thyself the sacrifice is for the righteous blent with meath,<br> Presenting viands thousandfold.<br> 3 Invoked and worthy of our praise bring Gods whose due is sacrifice:<br> Thou, Agni, givest countless gifts.<br> 4 To seat a thousand Heroes they eastward have strewn the grass with might,<br> Whereon, Ādityas, ye shine forth.<br> 5 The sovran all-imperial Doors, wide, good, many and manifold,<br> Have poured their streams of holy oil.<br> 6 With gay adornment, fair to see, in glorious beauty shine they forth:<br> Let Night and Morning rest them here.<br> 7 Let these two Sages first of all, heralds divine and eloquent,<br> Perform for us this sacrifice.<br> 8 You I address, Sarasvatī, and Bhāratī, and Iḷā, all:<br> Urge ye us on to glorious fame.<br> 9 Tvaṣṭar the Lord hath made all forms and all the cattle of the field<br> Cause them to multiply for us.<br> 10 Send to the Gods, Vanaspati, thyself, the sacrificial draught:<br> Let Agni make the oblations sweet.<br> 11 Agni, preceder of the Gods, is honoured with the sacred song:<br> He glows at offerings blest with Hail!</p>
