 <p>1. BRINGING our homage we have come to one magnificent in look.<br> Glorified of the mighty Gods<br> 2 To Asamati, spring of gifts, lord of the brave, a radiant car,<br> The conqueror of Bhajeratha<br> 3 Who, when the spear hath armed his hand, or even weaponless oerthrows<br> Men strong as buffaloes in fight;<br> 4 Him in whose service flourishes Iksvaku, rich and dazzling-bright.<br> As the Five Tribes that are in heaven.<br> 5 Indra, support the princely power of Rathaprosthas matched by none,<br> Even as the Sun for all to see.<br> 6 Thou for Agastya's sister's sons yokest thy pair of ruddy steeds.<br> Thou troddest niggards under foot, all those, O King, who brought no gifts.<br> 7 This is the mother, this the sire, this one hath come to be thy life.<br> What brings thee forth is even this. Now come, Subandhu, get thee forth.<br> 8 As with the leather thong they bind the chariot yoke to hold it fast,<br> So have I held thy spirit fast, held it for life and not for death, held it for thy security.<br> 9 Even as this earth, the mighty earth, holds fast the monarchs of the wood.<br> So have I held thy spirit fast, held it for life and not for death, held it for thy security.<br> 10 Subandlin's spirit I have brought from Yarna, from Vivasvān's Son,<br> Brought it for life and not for death, yea, brought it for security.<br> 11 The wind blows downward from on high, downward the Sun-God sends his heat,<br> Downward the milch-cow pours her milk: so downward go thy pain and grief.<br> 12 Felicitous is this mine hand, yet more felicitous is this.<br> This hand contains all healing balms, and this makes whole with gentle touch.</p>
