 <p>1. YON Sun hath mounted up, and this my happy fate hate mounted high.<br> I knowing this, as conqueror have won my husband for mine own.<br> 2 I am the banner and the head, a mighty arbitress am I:<br> I am victorious, and my Lord shall be submissive to my will.<br> 3 My Sons are slayers of the foe, my Daughter is a ruling Queen:<br> I am victorious: oer my Lord my song of triumph is supreme.<br> 4 Oblation, that which Indra gave and thus grew glorious and most high,<br> This have I offered, O ye Gods, and rid me of each rival wife.<br> 5 Destroyer of the rival wife, Sole Spouse, victorious, conqueror,<br> The others' glory have I seized as twere the wealth of weaker Dames.<br> 6 I have subdued as conqueror these rivals, these my fellow-wives,<br> That I may hold imperial sway over this Hero and the folk.</p>
