 <p>1. THESE men's great bounty hath been manifested, and the whole world of life set free from darkness.<br> Great light hath come, vouchsafed us by the Fathers: apparent is the spacious path of Guerdon.<br> 2 High up in heaven abide the Guerdon-givers: they who give steeds dwell with the Sun for ever.<br> They who give gold are blest with life eternal. they who give robes prolong their lives, O Soma.<br> 3 Not from the niggards-for they give not fireely-comes Meed at sacrifice, Gods satisfaction:<br> Yea, many men with hands stretched out with Guerdon present their gifts because they dread dishonour.<br> 4 These who observe mankind regard oblation as streamy Vāyu and light-finding Arka.<br> They satisfy and give their gifts in synod, and pour in streams the seven-mothered Guerdon.<br> 5 He who brings Guerdon comes as first invited: chief of the hamlet comes the Guerdon-bearer.<br> Him I account the ruler of the people who was the first to introduce the Guerdon.<br> 6 They call him Ṛṣi, Brahman, Sāma-chanter, reciter of the laud, leader of worship.<br> The brightly-shining God's three forms he knoweth who first bestowed the sacrificial Guerdon.<br> 7 Guerdon bestows the horse, bestows the bullock, Guerdon bestows, moreover, gold that Rsisters.<br> Guerdon gives food which is our life and spirit. He who is wise takes Guerdon for his armour.<br> 8 The liberal die not, never are they ruined: the liberal suffer neither harm nor trouble.<br> The light of heaven, the universe about us,all this doth sacrificial Guerdon give them.<br> 9 First have the liberal gained a fragrant dwelling, and got themselves a bride in fair apparel.<br> The liberal have obtained their draught of liquor, and conquered those who, unprovoked, assailed them.<br> 10 They deck the fleet steed for the bounteous giver: the maid adorns herself and waits to meet him.<br> His home is like a lake with lotus blossoms, like the Gods palaces adorned and splendid.<br> 11 Steeds good at draught convey the liberal giver, and lightly rolling moves the car of Guerdon.<br> Assist, ye Gods, the liberal man in battles: the liberal giver conquers foes in combat.</p>
