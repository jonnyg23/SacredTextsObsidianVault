 <p>1. OFFER to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly praise;<br> To him supremest oer the folk, the Son of Strength, the mighty Lord:<br> 2 Him in whose presence, when they meet in full assembly, men rejoice;<br> Even him whom worthy ones inflame, and living creatures bring to life.<br> 3 When we present to him the food and sacrificial gifts of men,<br> He by the might of splendour grasps the holy Ordinance's rein.<br> 4 He gives a signal in the night even to him who is afar,<br> When he, the Bright, unchanged by eld, consumes the sovrans of the wood.<br> 5 He in whose service on the ways they offer up their drops of sweat,<br> On him is their high kin have they mounted, as ridges on the earth.<br> 6 Whom, sought of many, mortal man hath found to be the Stay of all;<br> He who gives flavour to our food, the home of every man that lives.<br> 7 Even as a herd that crops the grass he shears the field and wilderness,<br> With flashing teeth and beard of gold, deft with his unabated might.<br> 8 For him, to whom, bright as an axe he, as to Atri, hath flashed forth,<br> Hath the well-bearing Mother borne, producing when her time is come.<br> 9 Agni to whom the oil is shed by him thou lovest to support,<br> Bestow upon these mortals fame and splendour and intelligence.<br> 10 Such zeal hath he, resistless one: he gained the cattle given by thee.<br> Agni, may Atri overcome the Dasyus who bestow no gifts, subdue the men who give no food.</p>
