 <p>1. WE worship with our reverence and oblations you, Mitra Varuṇa, accordant, mighty,<br> So that with us, ye Twain whose backs are sprinkled with oil, the priests with oil and hymns support you.<br> 2 Your praise is like a mighty power, an impulse: to you, Twain Gods, a well-formed hymn is offered,<br> As the priest decks yon, Strong Ones, in assemblies, and the prince fain to worship you for blessings.<br> 3 O Mitra-Varuṇa, Aditi the Milch-cow streams for the rite, for folk who bring oblation,<br> When in the assembly he who worships moves you, like to a human priest, with gifts presented.<br> 4 So may the kine and heavenly Waters pour you sweet drink in families that make you joyful.<br> Of this may he, the ancient House-Lord, give us. Enjoy, drink of the milk the cow provideth.</p>
