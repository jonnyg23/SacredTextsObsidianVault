 <p>1. Two perfect springs of heat pervade the Threefold, and come for their delight is Mātariśvan.<br> Craving the milk of heaven the Gods are present: well do they know the praisesong and the Sāman.<br> 2 The priests beard far away, as they are ordered, serve the three Nirrtis, for well they know them.<br> Sages have traced the cause that first produced them, dwelling in distant and mysterious chambers.<br> 3 The Youthful One, well-shaped, with four locks braided, brightened with oil, puts on the ordinances.<br> Two Birds of mighty power are seated near her, there where the Deities receive their portion.<br> 4 One of these Birds hath passed into the sea of air: thence he looks round and views this universal world.<br> With simple heart I have beheld him from anear: his Mother kisses him and he returns her kiss.<br> 5 Him with fair wings though only One in nature, wise singers shape, with songs, in many figures.<br> While they at sacrifices fix the metres, they measure out twelve chalices of Soma.<br> 6 While they arrange the four and six-and-thirty, and duly order, up to twelve, the measures,<br> Having disposed the sacrifice thoughtful sages send the Car forward with the Rc and Sāman.<br> 7 The Chariot's majesties are fourteen others: seven sages lead it onward with their Voices.<br> Who will declare to us the ford Apnana, the path whereby they drink first draughts of Soma?<br> 8 The fifteen lauds are in a thousand places that is as vast as heaven and earth in measure.<br> A thousand spots contain the mighty thousand. Vāk spreadeth forth as far as Prayer extendeth.<br> 9 What sage hath learned the metres' application? Who hath gained Vāk, the spirit's aim and object?<br> Which ministering priest is called eighth Hero? Who then hath tracked the two Bay Steeds of Indra?<br> 10 Yoked to his chariot-pole there stood the Coursers: they only travel round earth's farthest limits.<br> These, when their driver in his home is settled, receive the allotted meed of their exertion.</p>
