 <p>1. Soma, flow on, inviting Gods, speed to the purifying cloth:<br> Pass into Indra, as a Bull.<br> 2 As mighty food speed hitherward, Indu, as a most splendid Steer:<br> Sit in thy place as one with strength.<br> 3 The well-loved meath was made to flow, the stream of the creative juice<br> ne Sage drew waters to himself.<br> 4 The mighty waters, yea, the floods accompany thee Mighty One,<br> When thou wilt clothe thee with the milk.<br> 5 The lake is brightened in the floods. Soma, our Friend, heaven's prop and stay,<br> Falls on the purifying cloth.<br> 6 The tawny Bull hath bellowed, fair as mighty Mitra to behold:<br> He shines together with the Sun.<br> 7 Songs, Indu, active in their might are beautified for thee, wherewith<br> Thou deckest thee for our delight.<br> 8 To thee who givest ample room we pray, to win the joyous draught:<br> Great are the praise&amp; due to thee.<br> 9 Indu as, Indra's Friend, on us pour with a stream of sweetness, like<br> Parjanya sender of the rain.<br> 10 Winner of kine, Indu, art thou, winner of heroes, steeds, and strength<br> Primeval Soul of sacrifice.</p>
