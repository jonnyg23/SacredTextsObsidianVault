 <p>1. MAY the wind blow upon our Cows with healing: may they eat herbage full of vigorous juices.<br> May they drink waters rich in life and fatness: to food that moves on feet be gracious, Rudra.<br> 2 Like-coloured, various-hued, or single-coloured, whose names through sacrifice are known to Agni,<br> Whom the Aṅgirases produced by Fervour,vouchsafe to these, Parjanya, great protection.<br> 3 Those who have offered to the Gods their bodies, whose varied forms are all well known to Soma,<br> Those grant us in our cattle-pen, O Indra, with their full streams of milk and plenteous offspring.<br> 4 Prajāpati, bestowing these upon me, one-minded with all Gods and with the Fathers,<br> Hath to our cow-pen brought auspicious cattle: so may we own the offspring they will bear us.</p>
