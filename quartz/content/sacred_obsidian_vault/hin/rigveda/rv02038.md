 <p>1. UPRISEN is Savitar, this God, to quicken, Priest who neglects not this most constant duty.<br> To the Gods, verily, he gives rich treasure, and blesses him who calls them to the banquet.<br> 2 Having gone up on high, the God broad-handed spreads his arms widely forth that all may mark him.<br> Even the waters bend them to his service: even this wind rests in the circling region.<br> 3 Though borne by swift steeds he will yet unyoke them: e’en the fleet chariot hath he stayed from going.<br> He hath checked e’en their haste who glide like serpents. Night closely followed Savitar's dominion.<br> 4 What was spread out she weaves afresh, re-weaving: the skilful leaves his labour half-completed.<br> He hath arisen from rest, and parted seasons: Savitar hath approached, God, holy-minded.<br> 5 Through various dwellings, through entire existence, spreads, manifest, the household light of Agni.<br> The Mother gives her Son the goodliest portion, and Savitar hath sped to meet his summons.<br> 6 He comes again, unfolded, fain for conquest: at home was he, the love of all things moving.<br> Each man hath come leaving his evil doings, after the Godlike Savitar's commandment.<br> 7 The wild beasts spread through desert places seeking their watery share which thou hast set in waters.<br> The woods are given to the birds. These statutes of the God Savitar none disobeyeth.<br> 8 With utmost speed, in restless haste at sunset Varuṇa seeks his watery habitation.<br> Then seeks each bird his nest, each beast his lodging. In due place Savitar hath set each creature.<br> 9 Him whose high law not Varuṇa nor Indra, not Mitra, Aryaman, nor Rudra breaketh,<br> Nor evil-hearted fiends, here for my welfare him I invoke, God Savitar, with worship.<br> 10 May they who strengthen bliss, and thought and wisdom, and the Dames’ Lord and Narāśaṁsa aid us.<br> That good may come to us and wealth be gathered, may we be Savitar the God's beloved.<br> 11 So come to us our hearts' desire, the bounty bestowed by thee, from heaven and earth and waters,<br> That it be well with friends and those who praise thee, and, Savitar, with the loud-lauding singer.</p>
