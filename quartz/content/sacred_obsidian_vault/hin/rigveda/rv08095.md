 <p>1. As with Manu Samvarani, Indra, thou drankest Soma juice,<br> And, Maghavan, with Nipatithi, Medbyatithi, with Pustigu and Srustigu,<br> 2 T'he son of Prsadvana was Praskaniva's host, who lay decrepit and forlorn.<br> Aided by thee the Ṛṣi Dasyave-vrka strove to obtain thousands of kine.<br> 3 Call hither with thy newest song Indra who lacks not hymns of praise,<br> Him who observes and knows, inspirer of the sage, him who seems eager to enjoy.<br> 4 He unto whom they sang the seven-headed hymn, three-parted, in the loftiest place,<br> He sent his thunder down on all these living things, and so displayed heroic might.<br> 5 We invocate that Indra who bestoweth precious things on us.<br> Now do we know his newest favour; may we gain a stable that is full of kine.<br> 6 He whom thou aidest, gracious Lord, to give again, obtains great wealth to nourish him.<br> We with our Soma ready, Lover of the Song! call, Indra Maghavan, on thee.<br> 7 Neer art thou fruitless, Indra neer dost thou desert the worshipper<br> But now, O Maghavan, thy bounty as a God is poured forth ever more and more.<br> 8 He who hath. overtaken Krvi with his might, and silenced Śuṣṇa with deathbolts,<br> When he supported yonder heaven and spread it out, then first the son of earth was born.<br> 9 Good Lord of wealth is he to whom all Āryas, Dāsas here belong.<br> Directly unto thee, the pious Ruśama Paviru, is that wealth brought nigh.<br> 10 In zealous haste the singers have sung forth a song distilling oil and rich in sweets.<br> Riches have spread among us and heroic strength, with us are flowing Soma-drops.</p>
