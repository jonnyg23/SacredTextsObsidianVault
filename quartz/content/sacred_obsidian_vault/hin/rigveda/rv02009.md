 <p>1. ACCUSTOMED to the Herald's place, the Herald hath seated him, bright, splendid, passing mighty,<br> Whose foresight keeps the Law from violation, excellent, pure-tongued, bringing thousands, Agni.<br> 2 Envoy art thou, protector from the foeman, strong God, thou leadest us to higher blessings.<br> Refulgent, be an ever-heedful keeper, Agni, for us and for our seed offspring.<br> 3 May we adore thee in thy loftiest birthplace, and, with our praises, in thy lower station.<br> The place whence thou issued forth I worship: to thee well kindled have they paid oblations.<br> 4 Agni, best Priest, pay worship with oblation; quickly commend the gift to be presented;<br> For thou art Lord of gathered wealth and treasure. of the bright song of praise thou art inventor.<br> 5 The twofold opulence, O Wonder-Worker, of thee new-born each day never decreases.<br> Enrich with food the man who lauds thee, Agni: make him the lord of wealth with noble offspring.<br> 6 May he, benevolent with this fair aspect, best sacrificer, bring the Gods to bless us.<br> Sure guardian, our protector from the foemen, shine, Agni, with thine affluence and splendour.</p>
