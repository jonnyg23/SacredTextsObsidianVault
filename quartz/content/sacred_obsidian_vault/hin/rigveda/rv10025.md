 <p>1. SEND us a good and happy mind, send energy and mental power.<br> Then-at your glad carouse-let men joy in thy love, Sweet juice! as kine in pasture. Thou. art waxing great.<br> 2 rn all thy forms, O Soma, rest thy powers that influence the heart.<br> So also these my longings-at your glad carouse-spread themselves seeking riches. Thou art waxing great.<br> 3 Even if, O Soma, I neglect thy laws through my simplicity,<br> Be gracious-at your glad carouse-as sire to son. Preserve us even from slaughter. T'hou. art waxing great.<br> 4 Our songs in concert go to thee as streams of water to the wells.<br> Soma, that we may live, grant-at your glad carouse-full powers of mind, like beakers. Thou art waxing great.<br> 5 O Soma, through thy might who art skilful and strong, these longing men,<br> These sages, have thrown open-at your glad carouse-the stall of kine and horses. Thou art waxing great<br> 6 Our herds thou guardest, Soma, and the moving world spread far and wide.<br> Thou fittest them for living,at your glad carouse-looking upon all beings. Thou art waxing great.<br> 7 On all sides, Soma, be to us a Guardian neer to be deceived.<br> King, drive away our foemen-at your glad carouse:let not the wicked rule us. Thou art waxing great.<br> 8 Be watchful, Soma, passing wise, to give us store of vital strength.<br> More skilled than man to guide us,at your glad carouse-save us from harm and sorrow. Thou art waxing great.<br> 9 Chief slayer of our foemen, thou, Indu, art Indra's gracious Friend,<br> When warriors invoke him-at your glad carouse -in fight, to win them offspring. Thou art waxing great.<br> 10 Victorious is this gladdening drink: to Indra dear it grows in strength.<br> This-at your glad carouse -enhanced the mighty hymn of the great sage Kakṣīvān. Thou art waxing great.<br> 11 This to the sage who offers gifts brings power that comes from wealth in kine.<br> This, better than the seven, hath-at your glad carouse-furthered the blind, the cripple. Thou art waxing great.</p>
