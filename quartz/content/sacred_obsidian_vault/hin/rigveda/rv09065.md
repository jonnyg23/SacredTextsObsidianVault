 <p>1. THE, glittering maids send Sūra forth, the glorious sisters, close-allied,<br> Send Indu forth, their mighty Lord.<br> 2 Pervade, O Pavamana, all our treasures with repeated light,<br> God, coming hither from the Gods.<br> 3 Pour on us, Pavamana, rain, as service and rain praise for Gods:<br> Pour all to be our nourishment.<br> 4 Thou art a Steer by lustre: we, O Pavamana, faithfully<br> Call upon thee the Splendid One.<br> 5 Do thou, rejoicing, nobly-armed! pour upon us heroic strength:<br> O Indu, come thou bitherward.<br> 6 When thou art cleansed with both the hands and dipped in waters, with the wood.<br> Thou comest to the gathering-place.<br> 7 Sing forth your songs, as Vyaśva sang, to Soma Pavamana, to,<br> The Mighty One with thousand eyes;<br> 8 Whose coloured sap they drive with stones, the yellow meath-distilling juice,<br> Indu for Indra, for his drink.<br> 9 We seek to gain the friendly love of thee that Strong and Mighty One,<br> Of thee the winner of all wealth.<br> 10 Flow onward with thy stream, a Steer, inspiriting the Maruts Lord,<br> Winning all riches by thy might.<br> 11 I send thee forth to battle from the press, O Pavamana, Strong,<br> Sustainer, looker on the light.<br> 12 Acknowledged by this song of mine, flow, tawny-coloured, with thy stream<br> Incite to battle thine ally.<br> 13 O Indu, visible to all pour out for us abundant food:<br> Soma, be thou our prosperer.<br> 14 The pitchers, Indu, with thy streams have sung aloud in vigorous might<br> Enter them, and let Indra drink.<br> 15 O thou whose potent gladdening juice they milk out with the stones, flow on,<br> Destroyer of our enemies.<br> 16 King Pavamana is implored with holy songs, on man's behalf,<br> To travel through the firmament.<br> 17 Bring us, O Indu, hundredfold increase of kine, and noble steeds,<br> The gift of fortune for our help.<br> 18 Pressed for the banquet of the Gods, O Soma, bring us might, and speed,<br> Like beauty for a brilliant show.<br> 19 Soma, flow on exceeding bright with loud roar to the wooden vats,<br> Falcon-like resting in thine home.<br> 20 Soma, the Water-winner flows to Indra, Vāyu, Varuṇa,<br> To Viṣṇu and the Marut host.<br> 21 Soma , bestowing food upon our progeny, from every sides,<br> Pour on us riches thousandfold<br> 22 The Soma juices which have been expressed afar or near at hand,<br> Or there on Śaryaṇāvān's bank,<br> 23 Those pressed among Arjikas, pressed among the active, in men's homes,<br> Or pressed among the Races Five-<br> 24 May these celestial drops, expressed, pour forth upon us, as they flow,<br> Rain from the heavens apd hero strength.<br> 25 Urged forward oer the ox-hide flows the Lovely One of tawny hue,<br> Lauded by Jamadagni's song.<br> 26 Like horses urged to speed, the drops, bright, stirring vital power, when blent<br> With milk, are beautified in streams.<br> 27 So they who toil with juices send thee forward for the Gods repast:<br> So with this splendour flow thou on.<br> 28 We choose to-day that chariot-steed of thine, the Strong, that brings us bliss,<br> The Guardian, the desire of all,<br> 29 The Excellent, the Gladdener, the Sage with heart that understands,<br> The Guardian, the desire of all;<br> 30 Who for ourselves, O thou Most Wise, is wealth and fair intelligence,<br> The Guardian, the desire of all.</p>
