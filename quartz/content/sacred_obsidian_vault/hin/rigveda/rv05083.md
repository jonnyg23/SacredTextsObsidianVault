 <p>1. SING with these songs thy welcome to the Mighty, with adoration praise and call Parjanya.<br> The Bull, loud roaring, swift to send his bounty, lays in the plants the seed. for germination.<br> 2 He smites the trees apart, he slays the demons: all life fears him who wields the mighty weapon.<br> From him exceeding strong fices een the guiltless, when thundering Parjanya smites the wicked.<br> 3 Like a car-driver whipping on his horses, he makes the messengers of rain spring forward.<br> Far off resounds the roaring of the lion, what time Parjanya fills the sky with rain-cloud.<br> 4 Forth burst the winds, down come the lightning-flashes: the plants shoot up, the realm of light is streaming.<br> Food springs abundant for all living creatures, what time Parjanya quickens earth with moisture.<br> 5 Thou at whose bidding earth bows low before thee, at whose command hoofed cattle fly in terror,<br> At whose behest the plants assume all colours, even thou Parjanya, yield us great protection.<br> 6 Send down for us the rain of heaven, ye Maruts, and let the Stallion's flood descend in torrents.<br> Come hither with this thunder while thou pourest the waters down, our heavenly Lord and Father.<br> 7 Thunder and roar: the germ of life deposit. Fly round us on thy chariot waterladen.<br> Thine opened water-skin draw with thee downward, and let the hollows and the heights be level.<br> 8 Lift up the mighty vessel, pour down water, and let the liberated streams rush forward.<br> Saturate both the earth and heaven with fatness, and for the cows let there be drink abundant.<br> 9 When thou, with thunder and with roar, Parjanya, smitest sinners down,<br> This universe exults thereat, yea, all that is upon the earth.<br> 10 Thou hast poured down the rain-flood now withhold it. Thou hast made desert places fit for travel.<br> Thou hast made herbs to grow for our enjoyment: yea, thou hast won thee praise from living creatures.</p>
