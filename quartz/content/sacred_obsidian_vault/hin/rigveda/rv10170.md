 <p>1. MAY the Bright God drink glorious Soma-mingled meath, giving the sacrifice's lord uninjured life;<br> He who, wind-urged, in person guards our offspring well, hath nourished them with food and shines oer many a land.<br> 2 Radiant, as high Truth, cherished, best at winning strength, Truth based upon the statute that supports the heavens,<br> He rose, a light, that kills Vṛtras and enemies, best slayer of the Dasyus, Asuras, and foes.<br> 3 This light, the best of lights, supreme, all-conquering, winner of riches, is exalted with high laud.<br> All-lighting, radiant, mighty as the Sun to see, he spreadeth wide unfailing victory and strength.<br> 4 Beaming forth splendour with thy light, thou hast attained heaven's lustrous realm.<br> By thee were brought together all existing things, possessor of all Godhead, All-effecting God.</p>
