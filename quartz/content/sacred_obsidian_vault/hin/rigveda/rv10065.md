 <p>1. MAY Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa consent, Aryaman, Vāyu, Pūṣan, and Sarasvatī,<br> Ādityas, Maruts, Viṣṇu, Soma, lofty Sky, Rudra and Aditi, and Brahmaṇaspati.<br> 2 Indra and Agni, Hero-lords when Vṛtra fell, dwelling together, speeding emulously on,<br> And Soma blent with oil, putting his greatness forth, have with their power filled full the mighty firmament.<br> 3 Skilled in the Law I lift the hymn of praise to these, Law-strengtheners, unassailed, and great in majesty.<br> These in their wondrous bounty send the watery sea: may they as kindly Friends send gifts to make us great.<br> 4 They with their might have stayed Heaven, Earth, and Prthivi, the Lord of Light, the firmament, -the lustrous spheres.<br> Even as fleet-foot steeds who make their masters glad, the princely Gods are praised, most bountiful to man.<br> 5 Bring gifts to Mitra and to Varuṇa who, Lords of all, in spirit never fail the worshipper,<br> Whose statute shines on high through everlasting Law, whose places of sure refuge are the heavens and earth.<br> 6 The cow who yielding milk goes her appointed way hither to us as leader of holy rites,<br> Speaking aloud to Varuṇa and the worshipper, shall with oblation serve Vivasvān and the Gods.<br> 7 The Gods whose tongue is Agni dwell in heaven, and sit, aiders of Law, reflecting, in the seat of Law.<br> They propped up heaven and then brought waters with their might, got sacrifice and in a body made it fair.<br> 8 Born in the oldest time, the Parents dwelling round are sharers of one mansion in the home of Law.<br> Bound by their common vow Dyaus, Prthivi stream forth the moisture rich in oil to Varuṇa the Steer.<br> 9 Parjanya, Vāta, mighty, senders of the rain, Indra and Vāyu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:<br> We call on Aditi, Ādityas, and the Gods, those who are on the earth, in waters, and in heaven.<br> 10 Tvaṣṭar and Vāyu, those who count as Ṛbhus, both celestial Hotar-priests, and Dawn for happiness,<br> Winners of wealth, we call, and wise Bṛhaspati, destroyer of our foes, and Soma Indra's Friend.<br> 11 They generated prayer, the cow, the horse, the plants, the forest trees, the earth, the waters, and the hills.<br> These very bounteous Gods made the Sun mount to heaven, and spread the righteous laws of Āryas oer the land.<br> 12 O Aśvins, ye delivered Bhujyu from distress, ye animated Śyāva, Vadhrmati's son.<br> To Vimada ye brought his consort Kamadyu, and gave his lost Viṣṇāpū back to Viśvaka.<br> 13 Thunder, the lightning's daughter, Aja-Ekapād, heaven's bearer, Sindhu, and the waters of the sea:<br> Hear all the Gods my words, Sarasvatī give ear together with Purandhi and with Holy Thoughts.<br> 14 With Holy Thoughts and with Purandhi may all Gods, knowing the Law immortal, Manu's Holy Ones,<br> Boon-givers, favourers, finders of light, and Heaven, with gracious love accept my songs, my prayer, my hymn.<br> 15 Immortal Gods have I, Vasiṣṭha, lauded, Gods set on high above all other beings.<br> May they this day grant us wide space and freedom: ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
