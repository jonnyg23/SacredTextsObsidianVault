 <p>1. I SEND my voice as herald to the Ṛbhus; I crave the white cow for the overspreading.<br> Wind-sped, the Skillful Ones in rapid motion have in an instant compassed round the heaven.<br> 2 What time the Rbus had with care and marvels done proper service to assist their Parents,<br> They won the friendship of the Gods; the Sages carried away the fruit of their devotion.<br> 3 May they who made their Parents, who were lying like posts that moulder, young again for ever,<br> May Vāja, Vibhvan, Ṛbhu, joined with Indra , protect our sacrifice, the Soma-lovers.<br> 4 As for a year the Ṛbhus kept the Milch-cow, throughout a year fashioned and formed her body,<br> And through a year's space still sustained her brightness, through these their labours they were made immortal.<br> 5 Two beakers let us make,thus said the eldest. Let us make three,this was the younger's sentence.<br> Four beakers let us make,thus spoke the youngest. Tvaṣṭar approved this rede of yours, O Ṛbhus.<br> 6 The men spake truth and even so they acted: this Godlike way of theirs the Ṛbhus followed.<br> And Tvaṣṭar, when he looked on the four beakers resplendent as the day, was moved with envy.<br> 7 When for twelve days the Ṛbhus joyed reposing as guests of him who never may be hidden,<br> They made fair fertile fields, they brought the rivers. Plants spread oer deserts, waters filled the hollows.<br> 8 May they who formed the swift car, bearing Heroes, and the Cow omniform and all-impelling,<br> Even may they form wealth for us,the Ṛbhus, dexterous-handed, deft in work and gracious.<br> 9 So in their work the Gods had satisfaction, pondering it with thought and mental insight.<br> The Gods expert artificer was Vāja, Indra's Ṛbhukṣan, Varuṇa's was Vibhvan.<br> 10 They who made glad with sacrifice and praises, wrought the two Bays, his docile Steeds, for Indra,<br> Ṛbhus, as those who wish a friend to prosper, bestow upon us gear and growth of riches.<br> 11 This day have they set gladdening drink before you. Not without toil are Gods inclined to friendship.<br> Therefore do ye who are so great, O Ṛbhus, vouchsafe us treasures at this third libation.</p>
