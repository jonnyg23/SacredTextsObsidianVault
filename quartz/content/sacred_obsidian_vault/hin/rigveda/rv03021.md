 <p>1. SET this our sacrifice among the Immortals: be pleased with these our presents, Jātavedas.<br> O Priest, O Agni, sit thee down before us, and first enjoy the drops of oil and fatness.<br> 2 For thee, O Purifier, flow the drops of fatness rich in oil.<br> After thy wont vouchsafe to us the choicest boon that Gods may feast.<br> 3 Agni, Most Excellent! for thee the Sage are drops that drip with oil.<br> Thou art enkindled as the best of Seers. Help thou the sacrifice.<br> 4 To thee, O Agni, mighty and resistless, to thee stream forth the drops of oil and fatness.<br> With great light art thou come, O praised by poets! Accept our offering, O thou Sage.<br> 5 Fatness exceeding rich, extracted from the midst,this as our gift we offer thee.<br> Excellent God, the drops run down upon thy skin. Deal them to each among the Gods.</p>
