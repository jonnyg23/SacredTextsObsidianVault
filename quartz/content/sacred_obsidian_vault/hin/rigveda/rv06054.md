 <p>1. O PUSAN, bring us to the man who knows, who shall direct us straight,<br> And say unto us, It is here.<br> 2 May we go forth with Pūṣan who shall point the houses out to us,<br> And say to us, These same are they.<br> 3 Unharmed is Pūṣan's chariot wheel; the box neer falleth to the ground,<br> Nor doth the loosened felIy shake.<br> 4 Pūṣan forgetteth not the man who serveth him with offered gift:<br> That man is first to gather wealth.<br> 5 May Pūṣan follow near our kine; may Pūṣan keep our horses safe:<br> May Pūṣan gather gear for us.<br> 6 Follow the kine of him who pours libations out and worships thee;<br> And ours who sing thee songs of praise.<br> 7 Let none be lost, none injured, none sink in a pit and break a limb.<br> Return with these all safe and sound.<br> 8 Pūṣan who listens to our prayers, the Strong whose wealth is never lost,<br> The Lord of riches, we implore.<br> 9 Secure in thy protecting care, O Pūṣan, never may we fail.<br> We here are they who sing thy praise.<br> 10 From out the distance, far and wide, may Pūṣan stretch his right hand forth,<br> And drive our lost again to us.</p>
