 <p>1. BY your high Law firm order is established there where they loose for travel Sūrya's horses.<br> Ten hundred stood together: there I looked on this the most marvellous Deities' one chief glory.<br> 2 This, Mitra-Varuṇa, is your special greatness: floods that stood there they with the days attracted.<br> Ye cause to flow all voices of the cowpen: your single chariotfelly hath rolled hither.<br> 3 O Mitra-Varuṇa, ye by your greatness, both Kings, have firmly stablished earth and heaven,<br> Ye caused the cows to stream, the plants to flourish, and, scattering swift drops, sent down the rain-flood.<br> 4 Let your well-harnessed horses bear you hither: hitherward let them come with reins drawn tightly.<br> A covering cloud of sacred oil attends you, and your streams flow to us from days aforetime.<br> 5 To make the lustre wider and more famous, guarding the sacred grass with veneration,<br> Ye, Mitra-Varuṇa, firm, strong, awe-inspiring, are seated on a throne amid oblations.<br> 6 With hands that shed no blood, guarding the pious, whom, Varuni3, ye save amid oblations.<br> Ye Twain, together, Kings of willing spirit, uphold dominion based on thousand pillars.<br> 7 Adorned with gold, its columns are of iron. in heaven it glitters like a whip for horses;<br> Or stablished on a field deep-spoiled and fruitful. So may we share the meath that loads your car-seat.<br> 8 Ye mount your car gold-hued at break of morning, and iron-pillared when the Sun is setting,<br> And from that place, O Varuṇa and Mitra, behold infinity and limit~tion.<br> 9 Bountiful guardians of the world! the shelter that is impenetrable, strongest, flawless,<br> Aid us with that, O Varuṇa and Mitra, and when we long to win may we be victors.</p>
