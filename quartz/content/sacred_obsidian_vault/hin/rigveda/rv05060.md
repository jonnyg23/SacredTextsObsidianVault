 <p>1. I LAUD with reverence the gracious Agni: here may he sit and part our meed among us.<br> As with spoil-seeking cars I bring oblation: turned rightward I will swell the Marut's, praise-song.<br> 2 The Maruts, yea, the Rudras, who have mounted their famous spotted deer and cars swift-moving,<br> Before you, fierce Ones! woods bow down in terror: Earth, even the mountain, trembles at your coming.<br> 3 Though vast and tall, the mountain is affrighted, the height of heaven is shaken at your roaring<br> When, armed with lances, ye are sporting, Maruts, and rush along together like the waters.<br> 4 They, like young suitors, sons of wealthy houses, have with their golden natures decked their bodies.<br> Strong on their cars, the lordly Ones, for glory, have set their splendours on their forms for ever.<br> 5 None being eldest, none among them youngest, as brothers they have grown to happy fortune.<br> May their Sire Rudra, young and deft, and Pṛśni pouring much milk, bring fair days to the Maruts.<br> 6 Whether, O blessed Maruts, ye be dwelling in highest, midmost, or in lowest heaven,<br> Thence, O ye Rudras, and thou also, Agni, notice the sacrificial food we offer.<br> 7 O Maruts, Lords of all, when Agni and when ye drive downward from sublimest heaven along the heights,<br> Shakers of all, rejoicing, slayers of the foe, give riches to the Soma-pressing worshipper.<br> 8 O Agni, with the Maruts as they gleam and sing, gathered in troop, rejoicing drink the Soma juice;<br> With these the living ones who cleanse and further all, joined with thy banner, O Vaiśvānara, from of old.</p>
