 <p>1. SING strength to Indra that shall set his chariot in the foremost place.<br> Giver of room in closest fight, slayer of foes in shock of war, be thou our great encourager. Let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies.<br> 2 Thou didst destroy the Dragon: thou sentest the rivers down to earth.<br> Foeless, O Indra, wast thou born. Thou tendest well each choicest thing. Therefore we draw us close to thee. Let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies.<br> 3 Destroyed be all malignities and all our enemy's designs.<br> Thy bolt thou castest, at the foe, O Indra, who would srnite us dead: thy liberal bounty gives us wealth.<br> 4 The robber people round about, Indra, who watch and aim at us,<br> Trample them down beneath thy foot; a conquering scatterer art thou.<br> 5 Whoso assails us, Indra, be the man a stranger or akin,<br> Bring down, thyself, his strength although it be as vast as are the heavens.<br> 6 Close to thy friendship do we cling, O Indra, and depend, or, thee.<br> Lead us beyond all pain and grief along the path of holy Law.<br> 7 Do thou bestow upon us her, O Indra, who yields according to the singer's longing,<br> That the great Cow may, with exhaustless udder, pouring a thousand streams, give milk to feed us.</p>
