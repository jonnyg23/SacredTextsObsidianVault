 <p>1. I AM the royal Ruler, mine is empire, as mine who sway all life are all Immortals.<br> Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most lofty cover.<br> 2 I am King Varuṇa. To me were given these first existing high celestial powers.<br> Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most lofty cover.<br> 3 I Varuṇa am Indra: in their greatness, these the two wide deep fairly-fashioned regions,<br> These the two world-halves have I, even as Tvaṣṭar knowing all beings, joined and held together.<br> 4 I made to flow the moisture-shedding waters, and set the heaven firm in the scat of Order.<br> By Law the Son of Aditi, Law Observer, hath spread abroad the world in threefold measure.<br> 5 Heroes with noble horses, fain for battle, selected warriors, call on me in combat.<br> I Indra Maghavan, excite the conflict; I stir the dust, Lord of surpassing vigour.<br> 6 All this I did. The Gods own conquering power never impedeth me whom none opposeth.<br> When lauds and Soma juice have made me joyful, both the unbounded regions are affrighted.<br> 7 All beings know these deeds of thine thou tellest this unto Varuṇa, thou great Disposer!<br> Thou art renowned as having slain the Vṛtras. Thou madest flow the floods that were obstructed.<br> 8 Our fathers then were these, the Seven his, what time the son of Durgaha was captive.<br> For her they gained by sacrifice Trasadasyu, a demi-god, like Indra, conquering foemen.<br> 9 The spouse of Purukutsa gave oblations to you, O Indra-Varuṇa, with homage.<br> Then unto her ye gave King Trasadasyu, the demi-god, the slayer of the foeman.<br> 10 May we, possessing much, delight in riches, Gods in oblations and the kine in pasture;<br> And that Milch-cow who shrinks not from the milking, O Indra-Varuṇa, give to us daily.</p>
