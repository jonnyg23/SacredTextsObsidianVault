 <p>1. GREAT as he was, Soma hath gained strength by this high solemnity:<br> joyous he riseth like a bull.<br> 2 His task is done: his crushings of the Dasyus are made manifest:<br> He sternly reckoneth their debts.<br> 3 Soon as his song of praise is born, the Soma, Indra's juice, becomes<br> A thousand-winning thunderbolt.<br> 4 Seer and Sustainer, he himself desireth riches for the sage<br> When he embellisheth his songs.<br> 5 Fain would they both win riches as in races of the steeds. In war<br> Thou art upon the conquerors' side.</p>
