 <p>1. FORTH speed the Pair to bring the meditating God, benevolent with boons sent in return for boons.<br> May Indra graciously accept both gifts from us, when he hath knowledge of the flowing Soma juice.<br> 2 Thou wanderest far, O Indra, through the spheres of light and realms of earth, the region, thou whom many praise!<br> Let those who often bring their solemn rites conquer the noisy babblers who present no gifts.<br> 3 More beautiful than beauty must this seem to me, when the son duly careth for his parents' line.<br> The wife attracts the husband: with a shout of joy the man's auspicious marriage is performed aright.<br> 4 This beauteous place of meeting have I looked upon, where, like milch-cows, the kine order the marriage train;<br> Where the Herd's Mother counts as first and best of all, and round her are the seven-toned people of the choir.<br> 5 The Pious One hath reached your place before the rest: One only moves victorious with the Rudras' band.<br> To these your helpers pour our meath, Immortal Gods, with whom your song of praise hath power to win their gifts.<br> 6 He who maintains the Laws of God informed me that thou wast lying hidden in the waters.<br> Indra, who knoweth well, beheld and showed thee. By him instructed am I come, O Agni.<br> 7 The stranger asks the way of him who knows it: taught by the skilful guide he travels onward.<br> This is, in truth, the blessing of instruction: he finds the path that leads directly forward.<br> 8 Even now he breathed: these days hath he remembered. Concealed, he sucked the bosom of his Mother.<br> Yet in his youth old age hath come upon him: he hath grown gracious, good, and free from anger.<br> 9 O Kalasa, all these blessings will we bring them, O Kurusravana, who give rich presents.<br> May he, O wealthy princes, and this Soma which I am bearing in my heart, reward you.</p>
