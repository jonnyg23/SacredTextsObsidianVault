 <p>On this <a name="fr_1217"></a><a href="#fn_1212"><font size="1">1</font></a>, too, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! they relate this ancient story, (in the form of) a dialogue, which occurred, O son of P<i>ri</i>thâ! between a husband and wife. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife, seeing the Brâhma<i>n</i>a her husband, who had gone through all knowledge and experience <a name="fr_1218"></a><a href="#fn_1213"><font size="1">2</font></a>, seated in seclusion, spoke to him (thus): 'What world, indeed, shall I go to, depending on you as (my) husband, you who live renouncing (all) action, and who are harsh and undiscerning <a name="fr_1219"></a><a href="#fn_1214"><font size="1">3</font></a>. We have heard that wives attain to the worlds acquired by (their) husbands. What goal, verily, shall I reach, having got you for my husband?' Thus addressed, that man of a tranquil self, spoke to her with a slight smile: 'O beautiful one! O sinless one! I am not offended at these words of yours. Whatever action there is, that can be caught (by the touch) <a name="fr_1220"></a><a href="#fn_1215"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or seen, or heard, that only do the men of action engage in as. action. Those who are devoid of knowledge only lodge <a name="fr_1221"></a><a href="#fn_1216"><font size="1">5</font></a> delusion in themselves by means of action. And freedom from action</p>

 <p>is not to be attained in this world even for an instant <a name="fr_1222"></a><a href="#fn_1217"><font size="1">1</font></a>. From birth to the destruction of the body, action, good or bad, by act, mind or speech <a name="fr_1223"></a><a href="#fn_1218"><font size="1">2</font></a>, does exist among (all) beings. While the paths <a name="fr_1224"></a><a href="#fn_1219"><font size="1">3</font></a> (of action), in which the materials are visible, are destroyed by demons <a name="fr_1225"></a><a href="#fn_1220"><font size="1">4</font></a>, I have perceived by means of the self the seat abiding in the self <a name="fr_1226"></a><a href="#fn_1221"><font size="1">5</font></a>--(the seat) where dwells the Brahman free from the pairs of opposites, and the moon together with the fire <a name="fr_1227"></a><a href="#fn_1222"><font size="1">6</font></a>, upholding (all) beings (as) the mover of the intellectual principle <a name="fr_1228"></a><a href="#fn_1223"><font size="1">7</font></a>; (the seat) for which <a name="fr_1229"></a><a href="#fn_1224"><font size="1">8</font></a> Brahman and others concentrating (their minds) worship that indestructible (principle), and for which learned men have their senses restrained, and their selfs tranquil, and (observe) good vows. It is not to be smelt by the nose, and not to be tasted by the tongue. It is not to be touched by the sense of touch, but is to be apprehended by the mind. It cannot be</p>

 <p>conquered by the eyes,, and is entirely beyond the senses of hearing. It is devoid of smell, devoid of taste and touch, devoid of colour and sound, and imperishable <a name="fr_1230"></a><a href="#fn_1225"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (It is that) from which (this whole) expanse <a name="fr_1231"></a><a href="#fn_1226"><font size="1">2</font></a> (of the universe) proceeds, and on which it rests. From this the Prâ<i>n</i>a, Apâna, Samâna, Vyâna, and Udâna also proceed, and into it they enter <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1227"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Between the Samâna and the Vyâna, the Prâ<i>n</i>a and the Apâna moved. When that <a name="fr_1233"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">4</font></a> is asleep, the Samâna and Vyâna also are absorbed <a name="fr_1234"></a><a href="#fn_1229"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and between the Prâ<i>n</i>a and the Apâna dwells the Udâna pervading (all). Therefore the Prâ<i>n</i>a and the Apâna do not forsake a sleeping person. That is called the Udâna, as the life-winds are controlled <a name="fr_1235"></a><a href="#fn_1230"><font size="1">6</font></a> (by it). And therefore those who study the Brahman engage in penance <a name="fr_1236"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">7</font></a> of which I am the goal <a name="fr_1237"></a><a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">8</font></a>.

The nose, and the tongue, and the eye, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth, the mind and the understanding, these are the seven tongues <a name="fr_1241"></a><a href="#fn_1236"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the blaze of Vai<i>s</i>vânara. That which is to be smelt, that which is to be drunk, that which is to be seen, that which is to be touched, and likewise that which is to be heard, and also that which is to be thought of, and that which is to be understood, those are the seven (kinds of) fuel for me <a name="fr_1242"></a><a href="#fn_1237"><font size="1">5</font></a>. That which smells, that which cats, that which sees, that which touches, and that which hears. as the fifth, that which thinks, and that which understands, these are the seven great officiating priests <a name="fr_1243"></a><a href="#fn_1238"><font size="1">6</font></a>.

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> O beautiful one! The learned sacrificers throwing (in) due (form) the seven offerings into the seven fires in seven ways, produce them in their wombs <a name="fr_1244"></a><a href="#fn_1239"><font size="1">1</font></a>; (namely), that which is to be smelt, that which is to be drunk, that which is to be seen, that which is to be touched, and likewise that which is to be heard, that which is to be thought of, and also that which is to be understood. Earth, air, space, water, and light as the fifth, mind and understanding, these seven, indeed, are named wombs. All the qualities which stand <a name="fr_1245"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">2</font></a> as offerings are absorbed into the mouth of the fire <a name="fr_1246"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and having dwelt within that dwelling are born in their respective wombs <a name="fr_1247"></a><a href="#fn_1242"><font size="1">4</font></a>. And in that very (principle), which is the generator of all entities, they remain absorbed during (the time of) deluge. From that <a name="fr_1248"></a><a href="#fn_1243"><font size="1">5</font></a> is produced smell; from that is produced taste; from that is produced colour; from that touch is produced; from that is produced sound; from that doubt <a name="fr_1249"></a><a href="#fn_1244"><font size="1">6</font></a> is produced; from that is produced determination. This (is what) they know as the sevenfold production. In this very way was it <a name="fr_1250"></a><a href="#fn_1245"><font size="1">7</font></a> comprehended by the ancients. Becoming perfected by the perfect sacrifice <a name="fr_1251"></a><a href="#fn_1246"><font size="1">8</font></a>, they were perfectly filled with light.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1219"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1224">257:3</a> This is Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a's reading and interpretation. Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra reads 'actions visible and invisible.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1220"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1225">257:4</a> Cf. inter alia Kumâra-sambhava II, 46.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1221"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1226">257:5</a> I. e. says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, the safe place, within the body; and says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, the seat called Avimukta, between the nose and the brows; as to which cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0807.htm#page_67">p. 67</a>. In the Kenopanishad (p. 220) the word âyatana is used to signify a means to the attainment of the Brahman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1222"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1227">257:6</a> The moon and fire constitute the universe, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra. Cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0817.htm#page_113">p. 113</a>. Nîlakan<i>th</i>a interprets this more mystically as referring to the I<i>d</i>â and Pi<u>n</u>galâ arteries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1223"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1228">257:7</a> So Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, but he takes it to stand for 'vâyu' or wind, as a distinct principle. The sense is by no means clear. But the moon being the deity of the mind also may, perhaps, be described as she is here, on that account.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1224"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1229">257:8</a> This is Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra's interpretation of the original locative.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1226"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1231">258:2</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says this means the five great elements, the eleven organs (active and perceptive, and the mind), the life-wind, and the individual soul.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1227"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1232">258:3</a> The Prâ<i>n</i>a is at the nose, the Apâna at the arms, the Samâna at the navel, the Vyâna pervades the whole body, and the Udâna is at all the joints; cf. Yoga-sûtra III, 38 seq. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says this explains how the 'expanse' (meaning, he says, the operations of the creation, &amp;c.) 'proceeds' from the Brahman. See on the life-winds, B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>ny</i>aka, p. 667; <i>Kh</i>ândogya, pp. 42-188; Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, p. 96; Vedânta Paribhâshâ, p. 45; <a href="sbe0835.htm#page_271">p. 271</a> infra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1228"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1233">258:4</a> The self, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says, the Prâ<i>n</i>a accompanied by the Apâna.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1229"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1234">258:5</a> I. e. into the Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1230"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1235">258:6</a> Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a derives the word thus, utkarshe<i>n</i>a ânayati.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1231"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1236">258:7</a> I. e. the subjugation of the life-winds as indicated at Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0806.htm#page_61">p. 61</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1232"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1237">258:8</a> The meaning of the passage as a whole is not very clear, and the commentators afford but little help. The sense appears to be this: The course of worldly life is due to the operations of the life-winds which are attached to the self and lead to its manifestations as individual souls. Of these, the Samâna and Vyâna are <a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a> controlled and held under check by the Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna, into which latter the former are absorbed in sleep. The latter two are held in check and controlled by the Udâna, which thus controls all. And the control of this, which is the control of all the five, and which is otherwise called penance, destroys the course of worldly life, and leads to the supreme self.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1233"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1238">259:1</a> I. e. within the body.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1234"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1239">259:2</a> As explained in note  <a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">8</font></a>, <a href="#page_258">p. 258</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1235"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1240">259:3</a> This, says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, explains the word 'I' in the sentence preceding. Vaisvânara is a word often used to denote the self. The Vishama<i>s</i>lokî derives it thus, 'that which saves all beings from hell;' see the Prasna-upanishad, pp. 167-188 (where seven tongues are also referred to); Mu<i>nd</i>aka, p. 292; <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 364; Mândukya, p. 341.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1236"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1241">259:4</a> Cf. Taittirîya-âranyaka, p. 802.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1237"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1242">259:5</a> I. e. the Vaisvânara. Cf. Taittirîya-âranyaka, p. 803 and gloss.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1238"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1243">259:6</a> These I take to be the powers of hearing, &amp;c., which are presided over by the several deities; or, better, Perhaps, they may mean the soul distinguished as so many with reference to these several powers; cf. B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 169; Maitrî, p,. 96; Prasna, pp. 214, 215; Kaushîtaki, p. 96; Aitareya, p. 187; <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 616. The latter sense is accepted by Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1239"></a><a href="sbe0832.htm#fr_1244">260:1</a> The next clause explains this; that which is to be smelt is earth, and so on throughout. The men who sacrifice all sensuous objects, get such powers that they can create the objects whenever they like. As to 'in their wombs,' see Yoga Bhâshya, p. 108.</p>
