 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER VI.</h1>
 <p>The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said: On this, too, they relate this ancient story. Learn now of what description is the institution of the ten sacrificial priests <a name="fr_1252"></a><a href="#fn_1247"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The ear <a name="fr_1253"></a><a href="#fn_1248"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the tongue, the nose, the two feet, the two hands, speech, the genital organ, and the anus, these, verity, are ten sacrificial priests, O beautiful one! Sound, touch, colour, and taste, smell, words, action, motion, and the discharge of semen, urine, and excrement, these are the ten oblations. The quarters, wind, sun, moon, earth and fire, and Vish<i>n</i>u also, Indra, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Mitra, these, O beautiful one! are the ten fires <a name="fr_1254"></a><a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">3</font></a>. The ten organs are the makers of the offering; the offerings are ten, O beautiful one! Objects of sense, verily, are the fuel; and they are offered up into the ten fires. The mind is the ladle <a name="fr_1255"></a><a href="#fn_1250"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and the wealth is the pure, highest knowledge} <a name="fr_1256"></a><a href="#fn_1251"><font size="1">5</font></a>. (Thus) we have heard, was the universe duly divided <a name="fr_1257"></a><a href="#fn_1252"><font size="1">6</font></a>. And the mind, which is the instrument</p>

 <p>of knowledge, requires everything knowable <a name="fr_1258"></a><a href="#fn_1253"><font size="1">1</font></a> (as its offering). The mind is within the body the upholder of the frame, and the knower is the upholder of the body <a name="fr_1259"></a><a href="#fn_1254"><font size="1">2</font></a>. That <a name="fr_1260"></a><a href="#fn_1255"><font size="1">3</font></a> upholder of the body is the Gârhapatya fire; from that another is produced, and the mind which is the Âhavanîya; and into this the offering is thrown. Then the lord of speech was produced <a name="fr_1261"></a><a href="#fn_1256"><font size="1">4</font></a>; that (lord of speech) looks up to the mind. First, verily, are words produced; and the mind runs after them.</p>

 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife said:</p>
 <p>How did speech come into existence first, and how did the mind come into existence afterwards, seeing that words are uttered (after they have been) thought over by the mind? By means of what experience does intelligence come to the mind, and (though) developed, does not comprehend <a name="fr_1262"></a><a href="#fn_1257"><font size="1">1</font></a>? What verily obstructs it?</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>The Apâna becoming lord changes it into the state of the Apâna in consequence. That is called the movement of the mind, and hence the mind is in need (of it) <a name="fr_1263"></a><a href="#fn_1258"><font size="1">2</font></a>. But since you ask me a question regarding speech and mind, I will relate to you a dialogue between themselves. Both speech and mind went to the self of all beings <a name="fr_1264"></a><a href="#fn_1259"><font size="1">3</font></a> and spoke (to him thus), 'Say which of us is superior; destroy our doubts, O lord!' Thereupon the lord positively said to speech, 'Mind (is superior).' But speech thereupon said to him, 'I, verily, yield (you) your desires <a name="fr_1265"></a><a href="#fn_1260"><font size="1">4</font></a>.'</p>

 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_1266"></a><a href="#fn_1261"><font size="1">1</font></a> said:</p>
 <p>Know, that (in) my (view), there are two minds <a name="fr_1267"></a><a href="#fn_1262"><font size="1">2</font></a>, immovable and also movable. The immovable, verily, is with me; the movable is in your dominion. Whatever mantra, or letter, or tone goes to your dominion, that indeed is the movable mind <a name="fr_1268"></a><a href="#fn_1263"><font size="1">3</font></a>. To that you are superior. But inasmuch, O beautiful one I as you came personally to speak to me (in the way you did) <a name="fr_1269"></a><a href="#fn_1264"><font size="1">4</font></a>, therefore, O Sarasvatî! you shall never speak after (hard) exhalations <a name="fr_1270"></a><a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">5</font></a>. The goddess speech, verily, dwelt always between the Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna <a name="fr_1271"></a><a href="#fn_1266"><font size="1">6</font></a>. But, O noble one! going with the Apâna</p>

 <p>wind <a name="fr_1272"></a><a href="#fn_1267"><font size="1">1</font></a>, though impelled, (in consequence of) being without the Prâ<i>n</i>a, she ran up to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, saying, 'Be pleased <a name="fr_1273"></a><a href="#fn_1268"><font size="1">2</font></a>, O venerable sir!' Then <a name="fr_1274"></a><a href="#fn_1269"><font size="1">3</font></a> the Prâ<i>n</i>a appeared again nourishing speech. And therefore speech never speaks after (hard) exhalation. It is always noisy or noiseless. Of those two, the noiseless is superior to the noisy <a name="fr_1275"></a><a href="#fn_1270"><font size="1">4</font></a> (speech). This excellent (speech), like a cow, yields milk <a name="fr_1276"></a><a href="#fn_1271"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and speaking of the Brahman it always produces the eternal (emancipation). This cow-like speech, O you of a bright smile! is divine, with divine <a name="fr_1277"></a><a href="#fn_1272"><font size="1">6</font></a> power. Observe the difference of (its) two subtle, flowing (forms) <a name="fr_1278"></a><a href="#fn_1273"><font size="1">7</font></a>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a's wife said:</p>
 <p>What did the goddess of speech say on that occasion in days of old, when, though (she was) impelled with a desire to speak, words could not be uttered?</p>

So speech formerly spoke. Hence the mind is distinguished by reason of its being immovable, and the goddess distinguished by reason of her being movable <a name="fr_1283"></a><a href="sbe0834.htm#fn_1278"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1251"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1256">261:5</a> The 'priests' here being the senses, the knowledge would accrue to them, as to which cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0816.htm#page_108">p. 108</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1252"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1257">261:6</a> See note  <a href="#fn_1249"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1253"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1258">262:1</a> Each sense can only offer up its own perceptions--the mind offers up all knowledge whatever.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1254"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1259">262:2</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says this is an implied simile, the mind is an upholder of the body as the, 'knower' or self is.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1255"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1260">262:3</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says this means 'the mind.' I think it better to take it here as the self (see <a href="sbe0829.htm#page_238">p. 238</a> supra), to which the 'mind' and the 'other,' mentioned further on, would be subordinate; the 'other' Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra renders by the 'group of the senses.' The senses are compared to fires at Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0806.htm#page_61">p. 61</a>. The passage at Taittirîya-âranyaka above cited refers only to the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fires. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a's text and explanation of this passage are, to my mind, not nearly so satisfactory as Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra's.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1256"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1261">262:4</a> In the Taittirîya-brâhmana and Âra<i>n</i>yaka loc. cit., the equivalent of the original word for 'lord of speech' here occurs, viz. Vâkpati for Vâ<i>k</i>aspati here; but that is there described as the Hot<i>ri</i> priest, and speech itself as the Vedî or altar. The commentator there interprets 'lord of speech' to mean the wind which causes vocal activity, and resides in the throat, palate, &amp;c. As to mind and speech, see also <i>Kh</i>ândogya, pp. 285-441, and comments of <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara there. The meaning of this passage, however, is not by any means clear to my mind. The Da<i>s</i>ahot<i>ri</i> mantras in the Taittirîya are stated to be the mantras of the Ish<i>t</i>i, or sacrifice, performed by Pra<i>g</i>âpati for creation. It is possible, then, that the meaning here is, that speech which is to be learnt by the pupil, as stated further on--namely, the Vedas--was first produced from that Ish<i>t</i>i (cf. Kullûka on Manu I, 21). But to understand that speech, mind is necessary; hence it is said to look up to the mind. The Brâhma<i>n</i>a's, wife, however, seems to understand speech as ordinary speech, hence her question.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1257"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1262">263:1</a> This, again, is to my mind very hard to understand. The original word for 'intelligence' is mati, which at <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 514, <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara interprets thus: 'intelligence is pondering, application to (literally, respect for) the subject of thought.' The original for 'developed,' Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra renders by 'mixed or assimilated with;' and 'does not comprehend,' he takes to mean 'does not understand--speech or words.' This question appears to suggested by the last words of the, previous speech.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1258"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1263">263:2</a> These two sentences are again very obscure. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, as usual, deserts his original, giving peculiar meanings to the words without producing any authority. Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra is very meagre, and besides the MS. is very incorrect. See <a href="#page_264">p. 264</a>, note  <a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">5</font></a> infra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1259"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1264">263:3</a> I. e. Pra<i>g</i>âpati, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, which seems to be justified by the sequel. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a takes it to mean the individual self, which doubtless is its meaning elsewhere, e.g. Maitrî, p. 56.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1260"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1265">263:4</a> I. e. speech conveys information on all matters, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra; <a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a> as the means of acquiring desired fruit, visible or invisible, is learnt by speech, Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a. Cf. as to all this, B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka-upanishad, pp. 50 seq. and 261.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1261"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1266">264:1</a> I. e. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says, 'the Brâhma<i>n</i>a named mind,' alluding apparently to <a href="sbe0846.htm#page_310">p. 310</a> infra. But the reading of some of the MSS., viz. Brahman for the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, seems preferable, having regard to what follows. Apparently, the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's own speech should begin at 'The goddess speech' further on.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1262"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1267">264:2</a> Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says, immovable = to be understood by the external senses; movable = not perceptible by senses, such as heaven, &amp;c., which is not quite intelligible. Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says, the immovable mind is that of the teacher, which is fixed, as it has not to learn or acquire anything, while that of the pupil is movable as acquiring new impressions and knowledge.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1263"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1268">264:3</a> I. e. it is the movable mind which takes cognisance of the significations of all mantras (sacred texts), letters, tones, in which, I presume, sacred instruction is conveyed. To this mind, speech is superior, as that mind only works on what speech places before it; but the mind which is 'with' Pra<i>g</i>âpati, is superior to speech as it is not dependent on speech like the other.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1264"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1269">264:4</a> I. e. proudly, about her being the giver of desires to Brahman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1265"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1270">264:5</a> I. e., says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, the words will not come out with the Prâ<i>n</i>a life-wind and convey any sense to the hearer, but will be absorbed down into the Apâna life-wind, and not be articulated as speech at all. Cf. Kaushîtaki, p. 41; Ka<i>th</i>a, p. 184 (with glosses); and <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 42.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1266"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1271">264:6</a> I. e., I presume, was dependent on the two life-winds named. Cf. <a href="sbe0856.htm#page_353">p. 353</a> infra. For this sense of the word 'between,' see <a href="sbe0832.htm#page_258">p. 258</a> supra, and <i>Kh</i>ândogya-upanishad, p. 623.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1267"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1272">265:1</a> And not with the Prâ<i>n</i>a, so as to be articulated. Cf. <a href="#page_264">p. 264</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1268"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1273">265:2</a> I. e. to withdraw the 'curse' pronounced, as above stated.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1269"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1274">265:3</a> After the curse was withdrawn, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra. Cf. B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 317.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1270"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1275">265:4</a> Since, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, noiseless speech is the source of all words--Vâ<u>n</u>maya. Perhaps we may compare Aitareya-brâhmana (Haug), p. 47.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1271"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1276">265:5</a> Viz. Vâ<u>n</u>maya; milk, as a source of pleasure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1272"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1277">265:6</a> I. e. enlightening, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra. But, perhaps, the translation should be, 'has powers divine and not divine.' As to this, cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya Bhâshya on III, 41, and Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, p. 118, and Wilson's Sânkhya Kârikâ, p. 37 (Sanskrit), and <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatara, p. 284 (gloss).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1273"></a><a href="sbe0833.htm#fr_1278">265:7</a> Ar<i>g</i>una Mitra refers to a '<i>S</i>atapatha text' in praise of the subtle speech. I cannot trace the text. But see Nirukta (Roth), pp. 167-187.</p>
