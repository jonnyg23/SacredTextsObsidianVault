 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XXVII.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">Brahman said:</p>
 <p>From egoism, verily, were the five great elements born--earth, air, space, water, and light as the fifth. In these five great elements, in the operations of (perceiving) sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell, creatures are deluded <a name="fr_1638"></a><a href="#fn_1631"><font size="1">1</font></a>. When, at the termination of the destruction of the great elements, the final dissolution approaches, O talented one! a great danger for all living beings arises <a name="fr_1639"></a><a href="#fn_1632"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Every entity is dissolved into that from which it is produced. They are born one from the other, and are dissolved in the reverse order <a name="fr_1640"></a><a href="#fn_1633"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Then when every entity, movable or immovable, has been dissolved, the talented men who possess a (good) memory <a name="fr_1641"></a><a href="#fn_1634"><font size="1">4</font></a> are not dissolved at all. Sound, touch, and likewise colour, taste, and smell as the fifth; the operations (connected with these) have causes <a name="fr_1642"></a><a href="#fn_1635"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and are inconstant, and their name is delusion. Caused by the production of avarice <a name="fr_1643"></a><a href="#fn_1636"><font size="1">6</font></a>, not different from one another <a name="fr_1644"></a><a href="#fn_1637"><font size="1">7</font></a>, and insignificant <a name="fr_1645"></a><a href="#fn_1638"><font size="1">8</font></a>, connected with flesh and blood, and depending upon one another,</p>

 <p>excluded from the self <a name="fr_1646"></a><a href="#fn_1639"><font size="1">1</font></a>, these are helpless and powerless. The Prâ<i>n</i>a and the Apâna, the Udâna, the Samâna, and the Vyâna also, these five winds are also joined to the inner self <a name="fr_1647"></a><a href="#fn_1640"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and together with speech, mind, and understanding make the eight constituents of the universe <a name="fr_1648"></a><a href="#fn_1641"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He whose skin, nose, ear, eye, tongue, and speech are restrained, and whose mind is pure, and understanding unswerving <a name="fr_1649"></a><a href="#fn_1642"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and whose mind is never burnt by these eight fires <a name="fr_1650"></a><a href="#fn_1643"><font size="1">5</font></a>, he attains to that holy Brahman than which nothing greater exists. And the eleven organs, which are stated as having been produced from egoism--these, O twice-born ones! I will describe specifically. The ear, the skin, the two eyes, the tongue, the nose also as the fifth, the two feet, the organ of excretion, and the organ of generation, the two hands, and speech as the tenth; such is the group of organs, the mind is the eleventh. This group one should subdue first, then the Brahman shines (before him). Five (of these) are called the organs of perception, and five the</p>

 <p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 337</font></a></p>
 <p>organs of action. The five beginning with the ear are truly said to be connected with knowledge. And all the rest are without distinction connected with action. The mind should be understood to be among both <a name="fr_1651"></a><a href="#fn_1644"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the understanding is the twelfth. Thus have been stated the eleven organs in order. Understanding these <a name="fr_1652"></a><a href="#fn_1645"><font size="1">2</font></a>, learned men think they have accomplished (everything). I will now proceed to state all the various organs. Space <a name="fr_1653"></a><a href="#fn_1646"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the first entity; as connected with the self it is called the ear; likewise as connected with objects (it is) sound; and the presiding deity there is the quarters. The second entity is air; it is known as the skin as connected with the self; as connected with objects (it is) the object of touch; and the presiding deity there is lightning. The third (entity) is said to be light; as connected with the self it is called the eye; next as connected with objects (it is) colour; and the presiding deity there is the sun. The fourth (entity) should be understood to be water; as connected with the self it is called the tongue; as connected with objects it is taste; and the presiding deity there is Soma. The fifth entity is earth; as connected with the self it is the nose; as connected with objects likewise it is smell; and the presiding deity there is the wind. Thus are the five entities stated to be divided among the three <a name="fr_1654"></a><a href="#fn_1647"><font size="1">4</font></a>. I will now proceed to state all the various organs.</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> As connected with the self, the feet are mentioned by Brâhma<i>n</i>as, who perceive the truth; as connected with objects it is motion; the presiding deity there is Vish<i>n</i>u. The Apâna wind, the motion of which is downward, as connected with the self, is called the organ of excretion; as connected with objects it is excretion <a name="fr_1655"></a><a href="#fn_1648"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and the presiding deity there is Mitra. As connected with the self the generative organ is mentioned, the producer of all beings; as connected with objects it is the semen; and the presiding deity there is Pra<i>g</i>âpati. Men who understand the Adhyâtma speak of the two hands as connected with the self; as connected with objects it is actions; and the presiding deity there is Indra. Then first, as connected with the self, is speech which relates to all the gods; as connected with objects it is what is spoken; and the presiding deity there is fire. As connected with the self they mention the mind, which follows after the five entities <a name="fr_1656"></a><a href="#fn_1649"><font size="1">2</font></a>; as connected with objects it is the mental operation; the presiding deity there is the- moon. Likewise (there is) egoism, the cause of the whole course of worldly life, as connected with the self; as connected with objects, self-consciousness; the presiding deity there is Rudra. As connected with the self, they mention the understanding impelling the six senses <a name="fr_1657"></a><a href="#fn_1650"><font size="1">3</font></a>;</p>

 <p>as connected with objects that which is to be understood; and the presiding deity there is Brahman. There are three seats for all entities--a fourth is not possible--land, water, and space. And the (mode of) birth is fourfold. Those born from eggs, those born from germs, those born from perspiration, and those born from wombs-such is the fourfold (mode of) birth of the group of living beings <a name="fr_1658"></a><a href="#fn_1651"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Now there are the inferior beings and likewise those moving in the air. Those should be understood to be born from eggs, as also all reptiles. Insects are said to be born from perspiration; and worms of the like description. This is said to be the second (mode of) birth, and inferior. Those beings, however, which are born after the lapse of some time, bursting through the earth, are said to be born from germs, O best of the twice-born! Beings of two feet or more than two feet, and those which move crookedly, are the beings born from wombs. Understand about them also, O best of men! The eternal seat (where) the Brahman <a name="fr_1659"></a><a href="#fn_1652"><font size="1">2</font></a> (is to be attained) should be understood to be twofold-penance <a name="fr_1660"></a><a href="#fn_1653"><font size="1">3</font></a> and meritorious action. Such is the doctrine of the learned. Action should be understood to be of various <a name="fr_1661"></a><a href="#fn_1654"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p>descriptions, (namely) sacrifice, gift at a sacrifice, and sacred study <a name="fr_1662"></a><a href="#fn_1655"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for (every one) who is born <a name="fr_1663"></a><a href="#fn_1656"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Such is the teaching of the ancients. He who duly understands this, becomes possessed of concentration of mind, O chief of the twice-born! and know, too, that he is released from all sins. Space <a name="fr_1664"></a><a href="#fn_1657"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the first entity; as connected with the (individual) self it is called the ear; as connected with objects likewise it is called sound; and the presiding deity there is the quarters. The second entity is air; as connected with the (individual) self it is called the skin; as connected with objects it is the object of touch; and the presiding deity there is the lightning. The third is called light; as connected with the (individual) self it is laid down to be the eye; next as connected with objects it is colour; the presiding deity there is the sun. The fourth should be understood to be water; as connected with the (individual) self it is stated to be the tongue; as connected with objects it should be understood to be taste; the presiding deity there is Soma. The fifth element is earth; as connected with the (individual) self it is called the nose; as connected with objects likewise it is called smell; the presiding deity there is Vâyu. Thus have I</p>

 <p>accurately described to you the creation <a name="fr_1665"></a><a href="#fn_1658"><font size="1">1</font></a> as connected with the (individual) self. A knowledge of this, O ye who understand piety! is here obtained by those who possess knowledge. One should place all these together, (viz.) the senses, the objects of the senses, and the five great elements, and hold them by the mind <a name="fr_1666"></a><a href="#fn_1659"><font size="1">2</font></a>. When everything is absorbed into the mind, the pleasures of (worldly) life <a name="fr_1667"></a><a href="#fn_1660"><font size="1">3</font></a> are not esteemed. The learned (men) whose understandings are possessed of knowledge esteem the pleasure derived from that <a name="fr_1668"></a><a href="#fn_1661"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Now <a name="fr_1669"></a><a href="#fn_1662"><font size="1">5</font></a> I shall proceed to describe that discarding of all entities by (means) gentle and hard <a name="fr_1670"></a><a href="#fn_1663"><font size="1">6</font></a>, which produces attachment to subtle <a name="fr_1671"></a><a href="#fn_1664"><font size="1">7</font></a> (topics), and is sanctifying. The (mode of) conduct in which qualities are not (treated as) qualities <a name="fr_1672"></a><a href="#fn_1665"><font size="1">8</font></a>, which is free from attachment, in which one lives alone <a name="fr_1673"></a><a href="#fn_1666"><font size="1">9</font></a>, which is uninterrupted <a name="fr_1674"></a><a href="#fn_1667"><font size="1">10</font></a>, and which is full of the Brahman <a name="fr_1675"></a><a href="#fn_1668"><font size="1">11</font></a>, is called happiness (dwelling) in one aggregate <a name="fr_1676"></a><a href="#fn_1669"><font size="1">12</font></a>.</p>

 <p>The learned man who absorbs objects of desire from all sides, as a tortoise (draws in) his limbs <a name="fr_1677"></a><a href="#fn_1670"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and who is devoid of passion, and released from everything <a name="fr_1678"></a><a href="#fn_1671"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is ever happy. Restraining objects of desire within the self <a name="fr_1679"></a><a href="#fn_1672"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he becomes fit for assimilation with the Brahman <a name="fr_1680"></a><a href="#fn_1673"><font size="1">4</font></a>, having his cravings destroyed, and being concentrated in mind, and friendly and affectionate <a name="fr_1681"></a><a href="#fn_1674"><font size="1">5</font></a> to all beings. The fire of the Adhyâtma <a name="fr_1682"></a><a href="#fn_1675"><font size="1">6</font></a> is kindled in a sage by his abandoning the country <a name="fr_1683"></a><a href="#fn_1676"><font size="1">7</font></a>, and by the restraint of all the senses which hanker after objects of sense. As fire kindled with fuel shines forth with a great blaze, so the great self <a name="fr_1684"></a><a href="#fn_1677"><font size="1">8</font></a> shines forth through the restraint of the senses. When one with a tranquil self perceives all entities in one's own heart. then being self-illumined <a name="fr_1685"></a><a href="#fn_1678"><font size="1">9</font></a>, one attains to that which is subtler than (the most) subtle (thing) <a name="fr_1686"></a><a href="#fn_1679"><font size="1">10</font></a>, and than which there is nothing higher. It is settled, that the body in which the colour <a name="fr_1687"></a><a href="#fn_1680"><font size="1">11</font></a> is fire, the flowing <a name="fr_1688"></a><a href="#fn_1681"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>

It is a great ocean, fearful and unfathomable, and is named <a name="fr_1699"></a><a href="#fn_1692"><font size="1">11</font></a> delusion.

 <p>and restrain it <a name="fr_1700"></a><a href="#fn_1693"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Desire, wrath, fear, avarice, treachery, and falsehood also, (all these), which are difficult to get rid of, the good do get rid of by restraint of the senses <a name="fr_1701"></a><a href="#fn_1694"><font size="1">2</font></a>. And he who in this world has vanquished the three qualities and the five constituent elements <a name="fr_1702"></a><a href="#fn_1695"><font size="1">3</font></a>, obtains the highest <a name="fr_1703"></a><a href="#fn_1696"><font size="1">4</font></a>--the infinite-seat in heaven. Crossing the river of which the five senses are the lofty banks, the agitation of mind <a name="fr_1704"></a><a href="#fn_1697"><font size="1">5</font></a> the mighty waters, and delusion the reservoir <a name="fr_1705"></a><a href="#fn_1698"><font size="1">6</font></a>, one should vanquish both desire and wrath. Freed from all sins, he, then perceives that highest (principle), concentrating the mind within the mind <a name="fr_1706"></a><a href="#fn_1699"><font size="1">7</font></a>, and seeing the self within the self <a name="fr_1707"></a><a href="#fn_1700"><font size="1">8</font></a>.
