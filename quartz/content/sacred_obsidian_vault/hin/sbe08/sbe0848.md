 <p>That unperceived (principle), all-pervading, everlasting, and immutable, which is in a state of equilibrium <a name="fr_1528"></a><a href="#fn_1523"><font size="1">8</font></a>, should be understood (to become) the city of nine portals, consisting of three qualities, and five</p>

The three currents <a name="fr_1533"></a><a href="#fn_1528"><font size="1">5</font></a> which are within this (city) support (it) <a name="fr_1534"></a><a href="#fn_1529"><font size="1">6</font></a> again and again, and those three channels run on, being constituted by the three qualities. Darkness, passion, and goodness, these are called the three qualities, which are all coupled with one another, and likewise serve one another, which depend on one another, and attend on one another, and are joined to one another <a name="fr_1535"></a><a href="#fn_1530"><font size="1">7</font></a>.

 <p>(are made up of) the three qualities. Goodness is the match of darkness, and passion is the match of goodness; and goodness is also the match of passion, and darkness the match of goodness. Where darkness is restrained, passion there prevails. Where passion is restrained, goodness there prevails <a name="fr_1536"></a><a href="#fn_1531"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Darkness should be understood to consist in obscurity. It has three qualities <a name="fr_1537"></a><a href="#fn_1532"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and is called delusion. Its characteristic is also impiety, and it is constant in sinful actions. This is the nature of darkness; it also appears combined (with others). Passion is said to consist in activity, and is the cause of successive <a name="fr_1538"></a><a href="#fn_1533"><font size="1">3</font></a> (acts). When it prevails, its characteristic, among all beings, appears to be production <a name="fr_1539"></a><a href="#fn_1534"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Light, lightness <a name="fr_1540"></a><a href="#fn_1535"><font size="1">5</font></a>, faith, such is stated to be the nature of goodness (prevailing) among all beings, as accepted by good men. The true nature of their characteristics, in aggregation and separation, will now be stated together with the reasons; learn those accurately. Delusion, ignorance,</p>

 <p>want of liberality, indecision about actions <a name="fr_1541"></a><a href="#fn_1536"><font size="1">1</font></a>, sleep, haughtiness <a name="fr_1542"></a><a href="#fn_1537"><font size="1">2</font></a>, fear, avarice, grief, finding fault with good acts, want of memory <a name="fr_1543"></a><a href="#fn_1538"><font size="1">3</font></a>, immaturity (of intellect), nihilism <a name="fr_1544"></a><a href="#fn_1539"><font size="1">4</font></a>, violation of (the rules of) conduct, want of discrimination <a name="fr_1545"></a><a href="#fn_1538"><font size="1">3</font></a>, blindness, behaviour of the lowest <a name="fr_1546"></a><a href="#fn_1540"><font size="1">5</font></a> quality, pride of performance without (actual) performance, pride of knowledge without (actual) knowledge, unfriendliness, evil disposition, want of faith, deluded convictions, want of straightforwardness, want of knowledge <a name="fr_1547"></a><a href="#fn_1541"><font size="1">6</font></a>, sinful action, want of knowledge (of the subtle principle), stolidity <a name="fr_1548"></a><a href="#fn_1542"><font size="1">7</font></a>, lassitude, want of self-restraint, going into inferior ways; all these qualities, O Brâhma<i>n</i>as! are celebrated as being dark. And whatever other states of mind, connected with delusion, are found in various places in this world, all these are dark qualities. Constant talk in disparagement of gods Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Vedas, want of liberality, vanity, delusion <a name="fr_1549"></a><a href="#fn_1543"><font size="1">8</font></a>, anger, want of forgiveness likewise, and also animosity</p>

 <p>towards people, this is considered to be dark conduct. Whatever vain <a name="fr_1550"></a><a href="#fn_1544"><font size="1">1</font></a> actions (there are), and whatever vain gifts, and vain eating, that is considered to be dark conduct. Reviling, and want of forgiveness, animosity, vanity, want of faith also, this is considered to be dark conduct. And whatever such people there are in this world, doers of sinful acts. who break through (all) regulations, they are all held to be dark. I will state the wombs appointed for these (men) of sinful actions. They go to the hell, (namely) the brute (species), to be born in the lower hell <a name="fr_1551"></a><a href="#fn_1545"><font size="1">2</font></a>; (or become) the immovable entities <a name="fr_1552"></a><a href="#fn_1546"><font size="1">3</font></a>, animals, beasts of burden, demons, and serpents, and worms, insects, birds, and also creatures born from eggs, and all quadrupeds, and idiots, deaf and dumb men, and whatever others are attacked by diseases generated by sin <a name="fr_1553"></a><a href="#fn_1547"><font size="1">4</font></a>. These dark, evil-conducted men, who are sunk in darkness, who bear the marks of their own actions, the current of whose (thoughts) is downwards <a name="fr_1554"></a><a href="#fn_1548"><font size="1">5</font></a>, sink into darkness. I will now proceed to state their improvement and ascent; how, becoming men of meritorious actions, they attain to the worlds of those who perform good acts <a name="fr_1555"></a><a href="#fn_1549"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Resorting to a contrary <a name="fr_1556"></a><a href="#fn_1550"><font size="1">7</font></a> (course of life), and growing old in (good) actions <a name="fr_1557"></a><a href="#fn_1551"><font size="1">8</font></a>, they exert</p>

 <p>themselves, and through the ceremonies (performed for them) by benevolent Brâhma<i>n</i>as devoted to their own duties, they go upwards to the same world (as the Brâhma<i>n</i>as)--the heaven of the gods. Such is the Vedic text. Resorting to a contrary <a name="fr_1558"></a><a href="#fn_1552"><font size="1">1</font></a> (course of life), and growing old in their own duties, they become men in this world whose nature is to return <a name="fr_1559"></a><a href="#fn_1553"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Coming to a sinful womb, as <i>K</i>ândâlas <a name="fr_1560"></a><a href="#fn_1554"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or deaf, or lisping men, they attain to higher and higher castes in order; going beyond the <i>S</i>ûdra womb, and (beyond) whatever other dark qualities there are which abide in the quality of darkness <a name="fr_1561"></a><a href="#fn_1555"><font size="1">4</font></a> in the current (of this world). Attachment to objects of desire is laid down to be the great delusion. There, sages and saints and gods become deluded, wishing for pleasure. Darkness <a name="fr_1562"></a><a href="#fn_1556"><font size="1">5</font></a>, delusion, the great delusion, the great obscurity called anger, and death the blinding obscurity; anger is called the great obscurity. I have now duly described to you, O Brâhma<i>n</i>as! this quality of darkness, in full and accurately with reference to</p>

 <p>its nature, and also its qualities, and also. its source. Who, indeed, understands this properly; who, indeed, perceives this properly? The definition of the essence of darkness is, that one sees the real in what is unreal. The qualities of darkness have been described to you in many ways. And darkness in its higher and lower <a name="fr_1563"></a><a href="sbe0849.htm#fn_1557"><font size="1">1</font></a> (forms) has been accurately stated. The man who always understands these qualities gets rid of all dark qualities.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1524"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1529">318:1</a> The five gross elements of which the body is composed (cf. Mahâbhârata, <i>S</i>ânti Parvan, Moksha Dharma, chap. 183, st. 1 seq.) are developments of the unperceived principle, the Prakriti. Cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0817.htm#page_112">p. 112</a>, where the words 'which remain (absorbed) in nature' have been inadvertently omitted after 'with the mind as the sixth.' As to the nine portals cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0807.htm#page_65">p. 65</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1525"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1530">318:2</a> The five active organs, the five perceptive senses, and the mind.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1526"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1531">318:3</a> This Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra takes to mean 'egoism.' Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a takes the usual meaning, and adds, objects are produced from mental operations; 'distinguishing,' that is, manifesting as distinct entities.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1527"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1532">318:4</a> The eleven are, according to Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, the three qualities, the five gross elements, the group of organs and senses as one, egoism, and understanding.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1529"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1534">318:6</a> The three nâ<i>d</i>îs, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, support the life-winds. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a takes the three currents to be the threefold inclination of the mind, viz. towards a pure piety, towards injuring other living creatures, and towards that mixed piety which requires the destruction of life for its performance. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a also has a different reading from Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, which means 'are replenished' instead of 'support.' And the three channels are, according to Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, the Sa<i>m</i>skâras, or effects of previous actions of piety or impiety.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1530"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1535">318:7</a> Coupled = always existing in association with one another; serving = being necessary to the operations of one another; depending = supporting one another like three staves, says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a; <a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a> upholding, says Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra, as the total absence of one would lead to the absence of the others also; attending = becoming subordinate to whichever of them is dominant for the time being; joined = so as to become one organic whole Cf. as to all this, Yoga-sûtra II, 18, and commentary, p. 101; Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ, Kârikâ 12, With Vâ<i>k</i>aspati Mi<i>s</i>ra's comments on it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1531"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1536">319:1</a> Cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0816.htm#page_108">p. 108</a>, and the quotation in the Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, p. 64.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1532"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1537">319:2</a> I. e. characteristics, viz. obscurity (which seems to stand for ignorance), delusion (which is false knowledge), and impiety (doing that which is known to be sinful and wrong).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1533"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1538">319:3</a> The original means, according to Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, wrong, unlawful conduct. As to all this cf. <i>S</i>ânti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 194, St. 29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1534"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1539">319:4</a> I. e. apparently perpetually doing something. Cf. Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0816.htm#page_108">p. 108</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1535"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1540">319:5</a> Cf. as to this, and generally also, Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 13, and commentary of Vâ<i>k</i>aspati Mi<i>s</i>ra (p. 64). The blazing upward., of fire is said to illustrate the lightness of the quality of goodness which belongs to fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1536"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1541">320:1</a> According to Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0816.htm#page_108">p. 108</a>, doing nothing--stolid laziness--is a mark of darkness. Cf. generally on this passage Gîtâ, pp. <a href="sbe0816.htm#page_107">107</a>, <a href="sbe0819.htm#page_118">118</a>, <a href="sbe0820.htm#page_124">124</a> seq.; Maitrî, p. 49.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1537"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1542">320:2</a> The same word as at Gîtâ, pp. <a href="sbe0818.htm#page_116">116</a>, <a href="sbe0820.htm#page_125">125</a> (headstrong in the latter passage should have been haughty). Cf. as to the word, <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 383.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1539"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1544">320:4</a> The opposite of the belief mentioned at Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0820.htm#page_126">p. 126</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1540"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1546">320:5</a> The same word as at Gîtâ, <a href="sbe0816.htm#page_109">p. 109</a>. But the commentators render it here by hi<i>m</i>sra, i. e. destructive.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1541"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1547">320:6</a> I am not sure about the original word here, and the word next but one after this. The latter Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra renders by sûkshmatattvâvedanam, which I have translated above in the text. The former seems to mean general unintelligence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1542"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1548">320:7</a> Heaviness and dulness, induced by indolence, &amp;c., Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a. Lassitude is drooping from despondency. Going into inferior ways, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra says, means falling into the inferior castes; Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says it means love for base actions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1543"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1549">320:8</a> Not being cognisant of one's own shortcomings, Ar<i>g</i>una Mi<i>s</i>ra.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1546"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1552">321:3</a> Such as trees and so forth, which are also forms of life.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1547"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1553">321:4</a> This is alluded to in some Smritis too. And cf. <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 158, and the quotation in the commentary of Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra V, 122.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1548"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1554">321:5</a> Such, says Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, as to fit them for the nether world See Tattvakaumudi, p.113. As to marks, cf. <a href="sbe0829.htm#page_239">p. 239</a> supra.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1551"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1557">321:8</a> Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a renders this to mean 'destroyed for Agnihotra. and such ceremonies,' like the goat referred to above at <a href="sbe0840.htm#page_290">p. 290</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1552"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1558">322:1</a> See note  <a href="#fn_1550"><font size="1">7</font></a> on last page. The sequence of ideas seems not to be properly brought out here. In the course of transmigration after their course of conduct is altered they become men, and then proceed to heaven. This seems the real sense here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1553"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1559">322:2</a> To return to life and death, and so on, until they fit themselves for final emancipation. Cf. Âpastamba II, 5, 11, 10-11.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1554"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1560">322:3</a> Cf. <i>Kh</i>ândogya, p. 359.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1555"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1561">322:4</a> This is not very clear, and the commentators give but little help. The meaning probably is, that they gradually, in course of improvement, cross beyond the Sûdra caste, and all those qualities or tempers of mind, and so forth, which have been stated to appertain to the quality of darkness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1556"></a><a href="sbe0848.htm#fr_1562">322:5</a> Cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ pp. 47, 48, and Vâ<i>k</i>aspati's comment. There these are identified with the 'afflictions' of the Yoga-sâstra--ignorance, self-consciousness, affection, aversion, persistent attachment, and they are five divisions of false knowledge, or the quality of darkness, as it is here called. See, too, <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatara (comm.), p. 284.</p>
