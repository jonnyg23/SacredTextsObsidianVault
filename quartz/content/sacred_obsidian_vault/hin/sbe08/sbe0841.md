 <p align="CENTER">The Brâhma<i>n</i>a said:</p>
 <p>On this <a name="fr_1424"></a><a href="#fn_1419"><font size="1">3</font></a>, too, they relate an old story, (in the shape of) a dialogue, O you of a pure heart! between Kârtavîrya and the ocean. (There lived once) a king named Ar<i>g</i>una <a name="fr_1425"></a><a href="#fn_1420"><font size="1">4</font></a>, a descendant of K<i>ri</i>tavîrya, possessed of a thousand arms, who with his bow conquered the (whole) earth up to the ocean. Once</p>

 <p>on a time, as we have heard, he was walking about near the sea, proud of his strength, and showering hundreds of arrows on the sea. The ocean, saluting him, and with joined hands, said, 'O brave man! do not throw arrows (on me). Say, what shall I do for you? The creatures, who take shelter with me, are being destroyed, O tiger-like king! by the great arrows thrown by you. Give them security, O Lord!'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Ar<i>g</i>una said:</p>
 <p>If there is anywhere any wielder of the bow equal to me in battle, who might stand against me in the field, name him to me.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">The ocean said:</p>
 <p>If, O king! you have heard of the great sage <i>G</i>amadagni, his son is (the) proper (person) to show you due hospitality <a name="fr_1426"></a><a href="#fn_1421"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>
 <p>Then the king, full of great wrath, went away, and arriving at that hermitage approached Râma only. In company with his kinsmen, he did many (acts) disagreeable to Râma, and caused much trouble to the high-souled Râma. Then the power of Râma, whose power was unbounded, blazed forth, burning the hosts of the enemy, O lotus-eyed one! And then Râma, taking up his axe, hacked away that man of the thousand arms in battle, like a tree of many branches. Seeing him killed and fallen, all (his) kinsmen assembled together, and taking swords and lances, surrounded the descendant of Bh<i>ri</i>gu. Râma also taking up a bow, and hurriedly mounting a chariot, shot away volleys of arrows, and blew away the army of the king. Then some of the</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Kshatriyas, often troubled by fear of the son of <i>G</i>amadagni, entered mountains and inaccessible places, like antelopes troubled by a lion. And the subjects of those (Kshatriyas) who were not performing their prescribed duties <a name="fr_1427"></a><a href="#fn_1422"><font size="1">1</font></a> through fear of him, became V<i>ri</i>shalas, owing to the disappearance of Brâhma<i>n</i>as <a name="fr_1428"></a><a href="#fn_1423"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thus the Dravi<i>d</i>as, Âbhîras, Pau<i>nd</i>ras, together with the <i>S</i>âbaras, became V<i>ri</i>shalas <a name="fr_1429"></a><a href="#fn_1424"><font size="1">3</font></a>, owing to the abandonment of their duties by Kshatriyas. Then when the heroic (children) of Kshatriya women were destroyed again and again, the Kshatriyas, who were produced by the Brâhma<i>n</i>as <a name="fr_1430"></a><a href="#fn_1425"><font size="1">4</font></a>, were also destroyed by the son of <i>G</i>amadagni. At the end of the twenty-first slaughter, a bodiless voice from heaven, which was heard by all people, spoke sweetly to Râma, 'O Râma! O Râma! desist (from this slaughter). What good, dear friend, do you perceive, in taking away the lives of these kinsmen of Kshatriyas over and over again?' Then, too, his grandfathers <a name="fr_1431"></a><a href="#fn_1426"><font size="1">5</font></a>, with <i>Rik</i>îka as their head, likewise said to the high-souled (Râma), 'Desist, O noble one <a name="fr_1432"></a><a href="#fn_1427"><font size="1">6</font></a>!' But Râma, not forgiving his father's</p>

 <p align="CENTER">The Pit<i>ri</i>s said:</p>
 <p>O best of victors! you ought not to destroy these kinsmen of Kshatriyas. It is not proper for you, being a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, to slaughter these kings.</p>
