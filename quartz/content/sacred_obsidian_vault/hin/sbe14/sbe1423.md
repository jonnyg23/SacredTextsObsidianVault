 <p>1. A penance (shall be performed) for an offence committed unintentionally. <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Some (declare that it shall be performed) also for (a fault) committed intentionally.</p>  
 <p>3. 'The spiritual teacher corrects the learned; the king corrects the evil-minded; but Yama, the son of Vivasvat, forsooth, punishes those who offend secretly.'</p>  
 <p>4. And among those (sinful persons), let him who slept at sunrise stand during the (following) day and recite the verse sacred to Savit<i>ri</i>. <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Let him who slept at sunset remain in a sitting posture during the (next) night, likewise (reciting the Gâyatrî). <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. But let a man with deformed nails or black teeth perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance of twelve days' duration. <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. He whose younger brother married first shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance during twelve days, marry and take to himself even that (woman whom his brother wedded). <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. Now he who has taken a wife before his elder brother shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance and an Atik<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance, give (his wife) to that (elder brother), marry again, and take (back) the same (woman whom he wedded first).</p>  
 <p>9. The husband of a younger sister married before her elder sister shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance during twelve days, marry and take to him that (elder sister).</p>  
 <p>10. The husband of an elder sister married after the younger one shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance and an Atik<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance, give (his wife) to that (husband of the younger sister and marry again). <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. We shall, declare below (the penance prescribed for) him who extinguishes the sacred fire. <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. He who has forgot the Veda (by neglecting to recite it daily), shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance of twelve days' duration, and again learn it from his teacher. <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. He who violates a Guru's bed shall cut off his organ, together with the testicles, take them into his joined hands and walk towards the south wherever he meets with an obstacle (to further progress), there he shall stand until he dies: <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Or, having shaved all his hair and smeared his body with clarified butter, he shall embrace the heated (iron) image (of a woman). It is declared in the Veda that he is. purified after death, <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. The same (expiation is prescribed if the offence was committed) with the wife of the teacher, of a son, and of a pupil. <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. If he has had intercourse with a female (who is considered) venerable in the family, with a female friend, with the female friend of a Guru, with an Apapâtra female, or with an outcast, he shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance during three months. <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. The same (penance must be performed) for eating food given by a <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla or by an outcast. Afterwards the initiation (must be performed) once more; but the tonsure and the rest may be omitted.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed by Manu, 'The tonsure, (the tying on of) the sacred girdle, (the wearing of) a staff, and the begging of alias, these acts may be omitted on a second initiation.' <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. If (a Brâhma<i>n</i>a) intentionally (drinks) other spirituous liquor than that distilled from rice, or if he unintentionally (drinks) spirituous liquor extracted from rice (surâ), he (must perform) a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra and an Atik<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra, and, after eating clarified butter, be initiated again. <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. The same (expiation is prescribed) for swallowing ordure, urine, and semen.</p>  
 <p>21. If a Brâhma<i>n</i>a drinks water which has stood in a vessel used for (keeping) spirituous liquor, he becomes pure by drinking, during three days, water (mixed with a decoction) of lotus, Udumbara, Bilva, and Palâ<i>s</i>a (leaves). <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. But a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who repeatedly (and intentionally partakes) of liquor extracted from rice, shall drink (liquor of) the same (kind) boiling hot. 'He becomes pure after death.' <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. We will declare (who must be considered) the slayer of a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a (bhrû<i>n</i>ahan). He is called Bhrû<i>n</i>ahan who kills a Brâhma<i>n</i>a or destroys an embryo (the sex of) which is unknown. <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. 'For embryos (the sex of) which is unknown <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>become males; therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of males.'</p>  
 <p>25. Let the slayer of a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a kindle a fire and offer (therein the following eight oblations, consisting of portions of his own body), <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. The first (saying), 'I offer my hair to Death, I feed Death with my hair;' the second (saying), I offer my skin to Death, I feed Death with my skin;' the third (saying), 'I offer my blood to Death, I feed Death with my blood;' the fourth (saying), I offer my flesh to Death, I feed Death with my flesh;' the fifth (saying), 'I offer my sinews to Death, I feed Death with my sinews;' the sixth (saying), 'I offer my fat to Death, I feed Death with my fat;' the seventh (saying), 'I offer my bones to Death, I feed Death with my bones;' the eighth (saying), 'I offer my marrow to Death, I feed Death with my marrow.'</p>  
 <p>27. (Or) let him (fight) for the sake of the king, or for the sake of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and let him die in battle with his face turned (to the foe). <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. It is declared in the Veda, '(A murderer) who remains thrice unvanquished or is thrice defeated (in battle) becomes pure.' <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. 'A sin which is openly proclaimed becomes smaller.' <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. To this (effect) they quote also (the following verse): 'By saying to an outcast, "O thou outcast!" or to a thief, "O thou thief!" a man incurs a guilt as great as (that of the offender). (If he) falsely (accuses anybody of such offences), his guilt will be twice as great.' <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. In like manner having slain a Kshatriya, he shall perform (a penance) during eight years, <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. For (killing) a Vai<i>s</i>ya during six (years), <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>  
 <p>33. For (killing) a <i>S</i>ûdra, during three (years), <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. For killing a female of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a caste who is an Atreyî, and a Kshatriya or a Vai<i>s</i>ya, engaged in a sacrifice (the same penance must be performed as for killing a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a). <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. We will explain (the term) Atreyî. They declare that she who has bathed after temporary uncleanness is an Atreyî.</p>  
 <p>36. 'For if (the husband) approaches her at that (time), he will have offspring.' <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. (For killing a female of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a caste) who is not an Âtreyî, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Kshatriya (must be performed), <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">37</font></a></p>  
 <p>38. (For killing) a female of the Kshatriya caste, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Vai<i>s</i>ya,</p>  
 <p>39. (For killing) a female of the Vai<i>s</i>ya caste, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a <i>S</i>ûdra.</p>  
 <p>40. (For killing) a female of the <i>S</i>ûdra caste (let him perform) during one year (the penance prescribed for the murder of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a).</p>  
 <p>41. If a man has stolen gold belonging to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, he shall run, with flying hair, to the king, (exclaiming) 'Ho, I am a thief; sir, punish me!' The king shall give him a weapon made of Udumbara wood; with that he shall kill himself. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death. <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">41</font></a></p>  
 <p>42. Or (such a thief) may shave off all his hair, anoint his body with clarified butter, and cause himself to be burnt from the feet upwards, in a fire of dry cowdung. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death. <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">42</font></a></p>  
 <p>43. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Hear, (how) the bodies of those who having committed various crimes died a long time ago, and were (afterwards) born again, are (marked);'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. 'A thief will have deformed nails, the murderer of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a will be afflicted with white leprosy, but he who has drunk spirituous liquor will have black teeth, and the violator of his Guru's bed will suffer from skin diseases.' <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">44</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men). <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">45</font></a></p>  
 <p>46. It is declared in the Veda that (he who has associated with outcasts) becomes pure by reciting the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ (of his Veda), proceeding in a northerly direction and fasting. <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">46</font></a></p>  
 <p>47. They quote also (a verse) to this (effect), 'A sinner is liberated from guilt by tormenting his body, by austerities, and by reciting the Veda; he becomes also free by bestowing gifts. That has been declared in the Veda.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_597"></a><a href="sbe1423.htm#fr_597">105:23</a> Gautama XXII, 13. It must be understood a real Brâhma<i>n</i>a who knows the Veda is meant.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_598"></a><a href="sbe1423.htm#fr_598">105:24</a> 'Therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of males,' i.e. they perform the Pu<i>m</i>savana, one of the sacraments; <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a> see e<i>g</i>. Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 13. The Sûtra is marked as a quotation, and probably belongs to some Vedic work.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_602"></a><a href="sbe1423.htm#fr_602">106:29</a> Taken by itself the Sûtra would seem to refer to the maxim that a free confession reduces the guilt of the offender (Manu XI, 228). But on account of the next Sûtra it is necessary to assume, with K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita, that half the guilt of a crime, of which another man justly accuses an offender, falls on the accuser, while the <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a> offender's guilt becomes less by the publication of his misdeed. It is, however, not improbable that the text is here defective, and one or several Sûtras have been left out.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_604"></a><a href="sbe1423.htm#fr_604">107:31</a> Vish<i>n</i>u L, 12. The text is here evidently defective. The Sutra or Sûtras left out must have contained the description of another penance for the murder of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, which is mentioned in nearly all the Sm<i>ri</i>tis (see Vish<i>n</i>u L, 1-6, 15, and the parallel passages). Its chief conditions are, that the murderer is to live separate for twelve years, and to subsist on alms given by people who are acquainted with his crime. Without such an additional rule this and the following Sûtras are utterly unintelligible.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_608"></a><a href="sbe1423.htm#fr_608">107:36</a> The author means to say that the word âtreyî is derived from atra, at that time,' and the verb i, 'to approach.' The etymology is worthy of the Nirukta.</p>
