 <p>1. Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a (lunar penance). <a name="fr_1374"></a><a href="#fn_1374"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Let him fast on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month.</p>  
 <p>3. Having had the hair on his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails, or his beard alone, cut, let him enter, dressed, in new clothes and speaking the truth, the place where the sacrificial fire is preserved.</p>  
 <p>4. There a (common) fire, (which may be) fetched once (only, shall serve) him; or (the fire) must be produced by friction with the Ara<i>n</i>is. <a name="fr_1375"></a><a href="#fn_1375"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Let a student, who is a friend (of the performer), be ready at hand to (carry out his) directions;</p>  
 <p>6. And sacrificial viands (shall be his) food during the performance of the vow.</p>  
 <p>7. Having heaped fuel on the fire, scattered (Ku<i>s</i>a grass) around it, and performed (the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he offers burnt oblations, (cutting off portions) from the cooked food,</p>  
 <p>8. (The first) to Agni, (the second) to the lunar day whichever it may be, (the third and the fourth) <a name="fr_1376"></a><a href="#fn_1376"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>9. Now they mention (the following) other (oblations which are to be offered) to the points of the horizon and to their (guardian) deities, to the wide middle sphere and to its (guardian) deity.</p>  
 <p>10. Having offered (the oblation) to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (with the verse), 'Ever new,' &amp;c., he then places the remainder of the sacrificial viands into a goblet (ka<i>m</i>sa) or a cup (<i>k</i>amasa), pours seasoning, that is fit for sacrifices, over them, and eats fifteen morsels of ordinary size, <a name="fr_1377"></a><a href="#fn_1377"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. The first (saying, 'I offer) thee to Prâ<i>n</i>a,' the second (saying,' I offer) thee to Apâna,' the third (saying, 'I offer) thee to Vyâna,' the fourth (saying, 'I offer) thee to Udâna,' the fifth (saying, 'I offer) thee to Samâna.' If there are only four (mouthfuls, he eats) the first reciting two (texts); if there are three, (he eats) the first two reciting two (texts) with each; if there are two, (he eats) the first reciting two (texts and) the second reciting three texts; (if, there is only) one, (he recites) all (the five texts) together. <a name="fr_1378"></a><a href="#fn_1378"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Having drunk water (with the text), 'Thou <a name="fr_1379"></a><a href="#fn_1379"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>

 <p>art water used for moistening Soma,' &amp;c., he then offers the (following) additional oblations of clarified butter, with the seven Anuvâkas (beginning), 'May my Prâ<i>n</i>a, Apâna, Vyâna, Udâna, and Samâna be purified;' 'May my voice, mind, eye, ear,' &amp;c.; 'May my head, hands, feet;' 'May my skin;' 'May the sense of hearing, touch;' 'May earth, water;' 'May that which consists of food.'</p>  
 <p>13. (The ceremonies) beginning with the muttering (of sacred texts) and ending with the gift of a cow as a fee are known. <a name="fr_1380"></a><a href="#fn_1380"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. He worships the sun with (three verses) ad--dressed to Sûrya and the moon with (three verses) addressed to <i>K</i>andramas. <a name="fr_1381"></a><a href="#fn_1381"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. When he goes to rest, he mutters (the verse), 'O fire, keep thou good watch,' <a name="fr_1382"></a><a href="#fn_1382"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. When he awakes (in the morning, the verse), 'O fire, thou art the protector of vows.' <a name="fr_1383"></a><a href="#fn_1383"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Let him not talk with women and <i>S</i>ûdras addressing them first; let him not look at urine and ordure.</p>  
 <p>18. If he has seen any impure substance, he mutters (the text), 'Unrestrained (was) the internal organ, wretched my eye; the sun is the most <a name="fr_1384"></a><a href="#fn_1384"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>

 <p>excellent among the lights of heaven; O initiation, mayest thou not forsake me.'</p>  
 <p>19. On the first day of the latter half (of the month he eats) fourteen mouthfuls.</p>  
 <p>20. Thus (he takes every day) one (mouthful) less up to the day of the new moon.</p>  
 <p>21. On the day of the new moon there is not (even) one mouthful (left to take).</p>  
 <p>22. On the first day of the first half (of the month) one (mouthful may be eaten), on the second two.</p>  
 <p>23. Thus he daily increases (his meal) by one (mouthful) up to the day of the full moon.</p>  
 <p>24. On the day of the full moon he offers a Sthâlîpâka  to Agni, to the lunar day whichever it may be, and to the lunar mansions as well as to their (guardian) deities.</p>  
 <p>25. Having offered a burnt oblation to (the lunar mansion) Abhi<i>g</i>it (which stands) before <i>S</i>ro<i>n</i>â, and to its (guardian) deity, he must give a cow to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>  
 <p>26. That is the ant-shaped lunar penance; (that which is performed in the) inverted (order is called) the barleycorn-shaped (lunar penance). <a name="fr_1385"></a><a href="#fn_1385"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. A sinner who has performed either of these two (penances) becomes free from all mortal sins (pâtaka).</p>  
 <p>28. They declare that the (<i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a) shall be performed for the sake of the fulfilment of wishes of all kinds.</p>  
 <p>29. 'Thereby man obtains every wish which he may conceive.'</p>

 <p>30. 'Thereby the sages formerly purified themselves and accomplished their objects. That (rite) procures wealth, spiritual merit, sons, cattle, long life, heavenly bliss, and fame; it secures the fulfilment of all desires.'</p>  
 <p>31. 'He who studies this, becomes the companion of the lunar constellations, of sun and moon, and dwells in their world.'</p>
