 <p>1. (Now follows some) advice for him who is desirous of offspring.</p>  
 <p>2. The two A<i>s</i>vins have declared, that fame is gained by the procreation (of sons);</p>  
 <p>3. 'Performing acts which tend to prolong life and austerities, intent on the performance of the private recitation and of sacrifices, and keeping his organs in subjection, let him carefully beget offspring in his own caste.'</p>  
 <p>4. 'From his birth a Brâhma<i>n</i>a is loaded with three debts; these let him pay. A prudent man is free from doubts regarding the sacred law.'</p>  
 <p>5. 'If he worships the sages through the study of the Veda, Indra with Soma sacrifices, and the manes of his ancestors through (the procreation of) children, he will rejoice in heaven, free from debt.'</p>  
 <p>6. 'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains immortality, but through his son's grandson he ascends to the (highest) heaven.' (All that) has been declared in the Veda. <a name="fr_1289"></a><a href="#fn_1289"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. The Veda shows the existence of the three debts in the following (passage): 'A Brâhma<i>n</i>a is born loaded with three debts; (he owes) the studentship to the sages, sacrifices to the gods, and a son to the manes;' <a name="fr_1290"></a><a href="#fn_1290"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>8. Through the procreation of a virtuous son he saves himself.</p>  
 <p>9. He who obtains a virtuous son saves from the fear of sin seven in the descending line and seven in the ascending line, (viz.) six others (in each), himself being the seventh.</p>  
 <p>10. Therefore he obtains a reward if he begets issue.</p>  
 <p>11. Therefore he should sedulously beget offspring, <a name="fr_1291"></a><a href="#fn_1291"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Through the application of medicines and sacred texts.</p>  
 <p>13. The advice to him (who is intent on the procreation of children) is given in agreement with the revealed texts. <a name="fr_1292"></a><a href="#fn_1292"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. For it produces results in the case of all the castes.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1289"></a><a href="sbe1470.htm#fr_1289">271:6</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a XVII, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1290"></a><a href="sbe1470.htm#fr_1290">271:7</a> Vasish<i>th</i>a XI, 48. After this Sûtra the MSS. of the text <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a> insert the following corrupt passage: bandham ri<i>n</i>amoksham pra<i>g</i>âyâ<i>s</i> <i>k</i>âyattam pi<i>t</i><i>rî</i>nâ<i>m</i> <i>k</i>ânukarsha<i>s</i>abda<i>s</i> <i>k</i>a pra<i>g</i>âyâ<i>m</i> dar<i>s</i>ayati | anutsanna<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>âvân bhavati | yâ vad ena<i>m</i> pra<i>g</i>ânug<i>ri</i>h<i>n</i>îte tâvad akshaya<i>m</i> loka<i>m</i> gayati. The commentary does not notice it, and it seems to me that it needlessly interrupts the context.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1291"></a><a href="sbe1470.htm#fr_1291">272:11</a> M. and K. add to this Sûtra, âtmana<i>h</i> phalalâbhâya, 'in order to gain a reward for himself.' The same two MSS., further, insert the following Sûtras: tasmât putra<i>m</i> <i>k</i>otpâdyâtmânam evotpâdayatîti | vi<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âyate <i>k</i>âtmâ vai putranâmâsîti | eva<i>m</i> dvitîya âtmâ <i>g</i>îvatâ drash<i>t</i>avyo ya<i>h</i> putram utpâdayati | sa tathâ bhavati | tasmân nâtmâ kva<i>k</i>id akshetra utsrash<i>t</i>avya<i>h</i> | âtmânam avamanyate hi | yathâtmânam utpâdayati sa tathâ bhavati | tasmâd âdita eva kshetram anvi<i>k</i><i>kh</i>et sarvavar<i>n</i>e sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>tam upade<i>s</i>ena | tasmin dârasa<i>m</i>yoge pra<i>g</i>âm utpâdayed || 'Therefore (they say) that he who begets a son produces even his own self; and it is declared in the Veda, "Thou art self, called a son." Thus he who begets a son will see, during his lifetime, a second self. He becomes like him. Therefore one's own self must not be begotten on an unworthy female. For (he who does that) despises himself. He becomes even so, as he produces himself. Therefore (every man), each in his own caste, should first look out for a female who has been sanctified according to the injunction (of the sacred texts). Taking her to be his wedded wife, he shall beget a son.' It is possible that this passage really belongs to Baudhâyana, for it is written in the usual style of our Sûtra, and the last word of this passage as well as of Sûtra 11, as given in the Dekhan MSS., is utpâdayet. But it is not absolutely required by the context, and the commentary too omits it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1292"></a><a href="sbe1470.htm#fr_1292">273:13</a> I read with M., whose reading is confirmed by the explanation given in the commentary, tasyopade<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> <i>s</i>rutisâmânyenopadi<i>s</i>yate. The other MS. reads tasyopade<i>s</i>ena, and in the text of the commentary the first word is left out.</p>
