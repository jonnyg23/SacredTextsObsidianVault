 <p>1. Now we will explain the rule for entering the order of ascetics (sa<i>m</i>nyâsa).</p>  
 <p>2. Some (teachers say), 'He who has finished his studentship may become an ascetic immediately on (the completion of) that.' <a name="fr_1293"></a><a href="#fn_1293"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. But (according to others, asceticism is befitting) for Sâlînas and Yâyâvaras who are childless; <a name="fr_1294"></a><a href="#fn_1294"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. Or a widower (may become an ascetic). <a name="fr_1295"></a><a href="#fn_1295"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. (In general) they prescribe the profession of asceticism after the completion of the seventieth year and after the children have been firmly settled in (the performance of) their sacred duties.</p>  
 <p>6. Or a hermit in the woods (may become an <a name="fr_1296"></a><a href="#fn_1296"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>  
 <p>ascetic) on finishing the (special) ceremonies (prescribed for him).</p>  
 <p>7. 'That eternal greatness of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is neither increased nor diminished by works. The soul knows the nature of that (greatness). He who knows that, is not stained by evil deeds.' <a name="fr_1297"></a><a href="#fn_1297"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. 'It leads to the cessation of births.'</p>  
 <p>9. 'The eternal one leads (him) to glory.' The greatness (of asceticism is declared by these passages).</p>  
 <p>10. After having caused the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails to be cut, he prepares</p>  
 <p>11. Sticks, a rope, a cloth for straining water, a water vessel, and an alms-bowl. <a name="fr_1298"></a><a href="#fn_1298"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Taking these (implements, let him go) to the extremity of the village, or to- the extremity of the boundary (of the village), or to the house where the sacred fires are kept, partake of a threefold (mixture of) clarified butter, milk, (and) sour milk, and (afterwards) fast;</p>  
 <p>13. Or (he may partake of) water.</p>  
 <p>14. (Saying), 'Om, Bhû<i>h</i>, I enter the Sâvitrî, tat savitur vare<i>n</i>yam; Om, Bhuva<i>h</i>, I enter the Sâvitrî, bhargo devasya dhîmahi; Om, I enter the Sâvitrî, dhiyo yo na<i>h</i> pr.akodayât;' (he shall recite the Sâvitrî) foot by foot, half-verse by half-verse, (and finish by repeating) the whole or the parts (of the verse). <a name="fr_1299"></a><a href="#fn_1299"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. It is declared in the Veda, 'Entering order after order, (man) becomes (one with) Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>16. Now they quote also (the following verse) 'He who has passed from order to order, has offered burnt oblations and kept his organs in subjection, becomes afterwards, tired with (giving) alms and (making) offerings, an ascetic.' <a name="fr_1300"></a><a href="#fn_1300"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. Such an ascetic (becomes one with) the infinite (Brahman).</p>  
 <p>18. Before the sun sets, he heaps fuel on the Gârhapatya fire, brings the Anvâhâryapa<i>k</i>ana fire (to the spot), takes the flaming Âhavanîya. fire out (of the Gârhapatya), melts butter on the Gârhapatya fire, cleanses it (with Ku<i>s</i>a grass), takes four times (portions of it) in the sacrificial spoon (called Sru<i>k</i>), and offers in the Âhavanîya fire on which sacred fuel has been heaped, (four times) a full oblation, (saying), 'Om, Svâhâ!' <a name="fr_1301"></a><a href="#fn_1301"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. It is declared in the Veda that this (offering is) the Brahmânvâdhâna (putting fuel on the sacred fires for the sake of the universal soul).</p>  
 <p>20. Now in the evening, after the Agnihotra has been offered, he scatters grass to the north of the Gârhapatya fire, places the sacrificial vessels in pairs, the upper part turned downwards, on it, strews Darbha grass to the south of the Âhavanîya fire on the seat destined for the Brahman priest, covers</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p>it with the skin of a black antelope, and remains awake during that night.</p>  
 <p>21. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a who, knowing this, dies after fasting during the night of Brahman and repositing within himself the sacred fires, conquers all guilt, even (that of) killing a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_1302"></a><a href="#fn_1302"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. Then he rises in the muhûrta sacred to Brahman, and offers the early Agnihotra just at the (appointed) time.</p>  
 <p>23. Next, after covering the (part of the altar called) P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>yâ and bringing water, he prepares (an offering) to (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara (which is cooked) in twelve potsherds. That (well-)known Ish<i>t</i>i is the last (which he performs).</p>  
 <p>24. Afterwards he throws the sacrificial vessels, which are neither made of earth nor of stone, into the Âhavanîya fire,</p>  
 <p>25. (And) throwing the two Ara<i>n</i>is into the Gârhapatya fire (with the words), 'May ye be of one mind with us,' he reposits the sacred fires in himself. <a name="fr_1303"></a><a href="#fn_1303"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. (Reciting the sacred text), 'O Fire, that body of thine, which is fit for the sacrifice,' he inhales the smell of (the smoke of) each fire thrice three times.</p>  
 <p>27. Then, standing within the sacrificial enclosure, (he says) thrice in a low voice and thrice aloud, 'Om, Bhû<i>h</i>, Bhuva<i>h</i>, Sva<i>h</i>, I have entered the order of ascetics, I have entered the order of ascetics, I have entered the order of ascetics,'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. It is declared in the Veda, 'The gods are trebly true.' <a name="fr_1304"></a><a href="#fn_1304"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. (Finally) he pours out as much water as will fill his joined hands, (saying), 'I promise not to injure any living being.' <a name="fr_1305"></a><a href="#fn_1305"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. Now they quote also (the following verse) An ascetic who roams about after having given a promise of safety to all living beings, is not threatened with danger by any creature.' <a name="fr_1306"></a><a href="#fn_1306"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. (Henceforth) he must restrain his speech. <a name="fr_1307"></a><a href="#fn_1307"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. He grasps his staff, (saying), '(Thou art my) friend, protect me.'</p>  
 <p>33. He takes the rope, (reciting the verse), 'The brilliant light,' &amp;c. <a name="fr_1308"></a><a href="#fn_1308"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. He takes the cloth for straining water, (reciting the text), 'With which means of purification the gods,' &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>35. He takes the waterpot, (reciting the verse), Through that light, by which the gods rose on high,' &amp;c. <a name="fr_1309"></a><a href="#fn_1309"><font size="1">35</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. He takes the alms-bowl, (reciting the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis).</p>  
 <p>37. Taking with him the staves, the rope, the <a name="fr_1310"></a><a href="#fn_1310"><font size="1">37</font></a></p>

 <p>cloth for straining water, the waterpot, (and) the alms-bowl, he goes where water (is to be obtained), bathes, sips water, (and) washes himself, (reciting the verses called) Surabhimatî, Abliṅgâs, Vâru<i>n</i>îs, Hira<i>n</i>yavar<i>n</i>âs, and Pâvamânîs. Entering the water, he performs sixteen suppressions of the breath, (mentally repeating) the Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a hymn, ascends the bank, wrings out his dress, puts on another pure dress, sips water, takes the cloth for straining, (saying), 'Om, Bhû<i>h</i>, Bhuva<i>h</i>, Sva<i>h</i>,' and performs the Tarpa<i>n</i>a (with the following texts), 'Om, Bhû<i>h</i>, I satiate,' 'Om, Bhuva<i>h</i> --, Om, Sva<i>h</i> --, Om, Maha<i>h</i> --, Om, Gana<i>h</i> --, Om, Tapa<i>h</i> --, Om, Satyam --.'</p>  
 <p>38. He takes up as much water as his joined hands will hold for the manes, (and satiates them <a name="fr_1311"></a><a href="#fn_1311"><font size="1">38</font></a></p>  
 <p>with it) exactly in the same manner as the gods, (saying), 'Om, Bhû<i>h</i> Svadhâ, Om, Bhuva<i>h</i> Svadhâ,' &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>39. Then he worships the sun, (reciting) the two verses (which begin), 'Ud u tya<i>m</i> <i>k</i>itram,' &amp;c. <a name="fr_1312"></a><a href="#fn_1312"><font size="1">40</font></a></p>  
 <p>40. (Saying), 'Om, this (syllable Om), forsooth, is Brahman; this (syllable) which sheds warmth is light; this which gives warmth is the Veda; this must be known as that which sheds warmth;' he thus satiates the soul (and afterwards) worships the soul (with these texts), 'The soul (is) Brahman, (is) light.'</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a></p>  
 <p>41. Let him repeat the Sâvitrî one thousand times, or one hundred times, or an unlimited number of times.</p>  
 <p>42. (Saying), 'Bhû<i>h</i>, Bhuva<i>h</i>, Suva<i>h</i>,' he takes up the cloth for straining, (and) fetches water.</p>  
 <p>43. Let him not, (at any period) after that (moment), sip water which has not been drawn up (from a well and the like), which has not been strained, and which has not been completely cleansed. <a name="fr_1313"></a><a href="#fn_1313"><font size="1">43</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. Let him not wear any longer a white dress.</p>  
 <p>45. (He may carry) one staff or three staves.</p>
