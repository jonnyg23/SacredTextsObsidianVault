 <p>1. We will explain the rule for the adoption of a son. <a name="fr_1464"></a><a href="#fn_1464"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Man, formed of virile seed and uterine blood, proceeds from his mother and father (as an effect) from its cause. <a name="fr_1465"></a><a href="#fn_1465"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. (Therefore) the father and the mother have power to give, to abandon, or to sell their (son).</p>  
 <p>4. But let him not give nor receive (in adoption) an only son;</p>  
 <p>5. For he (must remain) to continue the line of the ancestors.</p>  
 <p>6. Let a woman neither give nor receive a son except with the permission of her husband.</p>  
 <p>7. He who is desirous of adopting (a son) procures two garments, two earrings, and a finger-ring; a spiritual guide who has studied the whole Veda; a layer of Ku<i>s</i>a grass and fuel of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood and so forth. <a name="fr_1466"></a><a href="#fn_1466"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>

 <p>8. Then he convenes his relations, informs the king (of his intention to adopt) in (their) presence, feeds the (invited) Brâhma<i>n</i>as in the assembly or in (his) dwelling, and makes them wish him 'an auspicious day,' 'hail,' (and) 'prosperity.' <a name="fr_1467"></a><a href="#fn_1467"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. Then he performs the ceremonies which begin with the drawing of the lines on the altar and end with the placing of the water-vessels, goes to the giver (of the child) and should address (this) request (to him), 'Give me (thy) son.'</p>  
 <p>10. The other answers, 'I give (him).'</p>  
 <p>11. He receives (the child with these words), 'I take thee for the fulfilment of (my) religious duties; I take thee to continue the line (of my ancestors).'</p>  
 <p>12. Then he adorns him with the (above-mentioned) two garments, the two earrings, and the finger-ring, performs the rites which begin with the placing of the (pieces of wood called) paridhis (fences round the altar) and end with the Agnimukha, and offers (a portion) of the cooked (food) in the fire. <a name="fr_1468"></a><a href="#fn_1468"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. Having recited the Puronuvâkyâ (verse), 'He who thinking of thee with a discerning mind,' &amp;c., he offers an oblation, reciting the Yâ<i>g</i>yâ (verse), 'To which performer of good deeds, thou, O <i>G</i>âtavedas,' &amp;c. <a name="fr_1469"></a><a href="#fn_1469"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Then he offers (oblations, reciting) the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis;--(the ceremonies) which begin the oblation to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t and end with the presentation <a name="fr_1470"></a><a href="#fn_1470"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>

 <p>of a cow as a fee (to the officiating priest are) known;--</p>  
 <p>15. And presents (to the spiritual guide) as a sacrificial fee those two dresses, those two earrings, and that finger-ring (with which he had adorned the child).</p>  
 <p>16. If after the performance of these (rites) a legitimate son of his own body is born (to the adopter, then the adopted son) receives a fourth (of the legitimate son's) share. Thus says Baudhâyana. <a name="fr_1471"></a><a href="#fn_1471"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_1465"></a><a href="sbe1491.htm#fr_1465">334:2</a>-6. Identical with Vasish<i>th</i>a XV, 1-5. The best MS. omits the particle tu, 'but,' in Sûtra 6, while others have it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1466"></a><a href="sbe1491.htm#fr_1466">334:7</a>-8. Vasish<i>th</i>a XV, 7. The translation of madhye by 'in their presence' rests on the authority of the Sa<i>m</i>skârakaustubha 47 b, 11, where it is explained madhye [a] iti bandhusamaksham. The other explanation 'in the middle (of his dwelling),' to which the interpolated text of the Dattaka Mîmâ<i>m</i>sâ and Dattaka <i>K</i>andrikrâ refers, is, however, also possible.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1467"></a><a href="sbe1491.htm#fr_1467">335:8</a> The ceremony alluded to is the so-called pu<i>n</i>yâhavâ<i>k</i>anam.</p>
