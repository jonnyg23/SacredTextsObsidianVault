   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>  
 <p>1. If a hundred improper acts, and even more, have been committed, and the (knowledge of the) <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Veda is retained, the fire of the Veda destroys all (the guilt) of that man just as a (common) fire consumes fuel.</p>  
 <p>2. As a fire that burns strongly consumes even green trees, even so the fire of the Veda destroys one's guilt caused by (evil) deeds.</p>  
 <p>3. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a who remembers the Rig-veda is not tainted by any guilt, though he has destroyed these (three) worlds and has eaten the food of all, (even of the most sinful) men. <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. If (a Brâhma<i>n</i>a) relies on the power of the Veda, he cannot find pleasure in sinful acts. Guilt (incurred) through ignorance and negligence is destroyed, not (that of) other (intentional offences).</p>  
 <p>5. If a hermit subsisting on roots and fruit practises austerities in a forest, and (a householder) recites a single <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, the merit of the acts of the one and of the other is equal.</p>  
 <p>6. Let him strengthen the Veda by (studying) the Itihâsas and Purâ<i>n</i>as. For the Veda fears a man of little learning, (thinking) 'He will destroy me.'</p>  
 <p>7. The daily recitation of the Veda and the performance, according to one's ability, of the series of Mahâya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as quickly destroy guilt, even that of mortal sins.</p>  
 <p>8. Let him daily perform, without tiring, his particular rites which the Veda enjoins. For if he does that according to his ability, he will reach the most blessed state. <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. Through sacrificing for wicked people, through teaching them, through intermarrying with them, and through receiving gifts from them, (learned)</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Brâhma<i>n</i>as do not contract guilt, for (a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a) resembles a fire and the sun.</p>  
 <p>10. I will now declare the purification prescribed for (eating) food, regarding which doubts have arisen, whether it may be called fit to be eaten or not. Listen to my words!</p>  
 <p>11. Let a Brâhma<i>n</i>a drink during three days the astringent decoction of the Brahmasuvar<i>k</i>alâ plant, unmixed with salt or pungent condiments, and (a decoction of) the <i>S</i>aṅkhapushpî plant, together with milk.</p>  
 <p>12. Let him drink water, after boiling in it Palâ<i>s</i>a and Bilva leaves, Ku<i>s</i>a grass, and (leaves of) lotuses and Udumbara trees; after three days and no more he becomes pure. <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. (Subsisting) during one day on each (of the following substances), cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and water in which Ku<i>s</i>a grass has been boiled, and fasting on the seventh day purify even (him who fears that he has partaken of the food of) a <i>S</i>vapâka. <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. He who lives during five days on cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, and clarified butter, is purified by means of (that) Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>agavya, (the five products of the cow.)</p>  
 <p>15. He who, in accordance with the rule, uses barley (for his food), becomes pure even by ocular proof. (For) if he is pure, those (barley grains) will be white, if he is impure they will be discoloured. <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. (If he makes) three morning meals of food <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>

 <p>fit for a sacrifice and three evening meals in like manner, and if food given without asking (is his subsistence) in the same manner, (he will thus perform) three fasts.</p>  
 <p>17. Now if he is in haste to make (himself pure), (let him) subsist on air during a day, and pass the night standing in water; (that penance) is equal to a Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya (K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra).</p>  
 <p>18. But if at sunrise he mutters the Gâyatrî eight thousand times, he will be freed from all mortal sins, provided he be not the slayer of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">18</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. He, forsooth, who has stolen (the gold of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a), has drunk spirituous liquor, has slain a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a, or has violated his Guru's bed, will become free from all (these) mortal sins if he studies the Institutes of the sacred law.</p>  
 <p>20. For unlawful acts, for unlawful sacrifices, and for great sins (let him perform) a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra and a <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a, which destroy all guilt.</p>  
 <p>21. Let him add daily one mouthful (to his food) during the bright (half of the month), let him diminish it (daily by one mouthful) during the dark (half), and let him fast on the new-moon day; that is the rule for the <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a (or lunar penance). <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">21</font></a></p>
