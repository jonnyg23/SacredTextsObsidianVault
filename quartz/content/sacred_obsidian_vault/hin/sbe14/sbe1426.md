 <p>1. If a student has approached a woman, he shall slay in the forest, in a place where four roads meet <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> (kindling) a common fire, an ass for the Rakshas (the goblins),</p>  
 <p>2. Or he may offer an oblation of rice (<i>k</i>aru) to Nir<i>ri</i>ti (the goddess of hell).</p>  
 <p>3. Let him throw into the fire (four oblations consisting) of that (sacrificial food, saying), To Lust svâhâ; to him who follows his lust svâhâ; to Nir<i>ri</i>ti svâhâ; to the divine Rakshas svâhâ.'</p>  
 <p>4. If, before returning home (from his teacher, a student) voluntarily defiles himself, sleeps in the day-time, or practises any other vow (than that of studentship), the same (penance must be performed). <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. If he has committed a bestial crime, he shall give a white bull (to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a). <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. The guilt incurred by a bestial crime with a cow, has been explained by the (rule regarding) the killing of a female of the <i>S</i>ûdra caste. <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. A student breaks his vow by performing funeral rites, <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. Excepting those of his mother and his father. <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. If a (student) is sick, he may eat, at his pleasure, all that is left by his teacher as medicine. <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. If (a student) who is employed by his teacher (to perform some duty), meets with his death, (the teacher) shall perform three K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penances. <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. If a student eats meat which has been given to him as leavings (by his teacher), he shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance of twelve days' duration, and afterwards finish his vow. <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. The same (penance must be performed) if he eats food given at a <i>S</i>râddha or by a person who is impure on account of a recent death or birth. <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. It is declared in the Veda, than honey given without asking does not defile (a student) of the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-<i>s</i>âkhâ. <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. For him who committing suicide becomes An Abhi<i>s</i>asta, his blood-relations (sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a) shall not perform the funeral rites. <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. He is called a suicide who destroys himself by means of wood, water, clods of earth, stones, weapons, poison, or a rope.</p>  
 <p>16. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The twice-born man who out of affection performs the last rites for a suicide, shall perform a <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a penance together with a Taptak<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra.' <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">16</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. We shall describe the <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a below. <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">17</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. A fast of three days (must be performed) for resolving to die by one's own hand.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. 'He who attempts suicide, but remains alive, shall perform a K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance during twelve days. (Afterwards) he shall fast for three (days and) nights, being dressed constantly in a garment smeared (with clarified butter), and suppressing his breath, he shall thrice recite the Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a;'</p>  
 <p>20. Or, following the same rule, he may also frequently recite the Gâyatrî;</p>  
 <p>21. Or, having kindled a fire, he may offer clarified butter with the Kûshmâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>as.</p>  
 <p>22. 'And the guilt (of) all (offences) excepting mortal sins is removed thereby.' <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. Now he may also sip water in the morning, thinking of (the Mantra), 'May fire and wrath and the lords of wrath protect me,' &amp;c., and meditating on his sin; (then) he may mutter the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis that end with satya (truth), prefixing (the syllable) Om (to each), or he may recite the Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">23</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. If he touches a human bone to which fat still adheres, he becomes impure during three (days and) nights; <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">24</font></a></p>  
 <p>25. But (on touching a bone) to which no fat adheres, a day and a night,</p>  
 <p>26. Likewise if he has followed a corpse (to the burial-ground). <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. If he passes between men reciting the Veda, he shall fast during a day and a night.</p>  
 <p>28. (Those who recite the Veda) shall sprinkle each other with water and stay away (from their houses) during three (days and) nights. <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. (The same penance must be performed) for a day and night, if a dog, a cat, or an ichneumon pass quickly (between those who recite the Veda). <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>  
 <p>30. If he has swallowed the flesh of a dog, a cock, a village pig, a grey heron, a vulture, a Bhâsa, a pigeon, a man, a crow or an owl, (he must) fast during seven days, (and thus) empty his entrails (afterwards he must) eat clarified butter, and be initiated again. <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">30</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. 'But a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who has been bitten by a dog, becomes pure, if he goes to a river that flows into the ocean, (bathes there), suppresses his breath one hundred times, and eats clarified butter.' <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. 'Time, fire, purity of mind, water, looking at the sun, and ignorance (of defilement) are the six means by which created beings are purified.' <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">32</font></a></p>  
 <p>33. It is declared in the Veda that, on touching a dog, a <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla, or an outcast, he becomes at once pure, if he bathes, dressed in his clothes. <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">33</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. If (while reciting the Veda) they hear noises</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a></p>  
 <p>made by outcasts or <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âlas, they shall sit silent and fasting during three days;</p>  
 <p>35. Or if they repeat that (text of the Gâyatrî) at least one thousand times, they become pure; thus it is stated in the Veda.</p>  
 <p>36. By this rule (the penance to be performed by) those who teach or sacrifice for vile men has been explained. It is declared in the Veda that they become pure by also relinquishing the fees (which they received). <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. By this same (rule the penance prescribed for) an Abhi<i>s</i>asta, (one accused of a heinous crime,) has been explained.</p>  
 <p>38. (If he has been accused of) killing a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a, let him subsist during twelve days on water (only), and fast during (another) twelve days. <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">38</font></a></p>  
 <p>39. If he has falsely accused a Brâhma<i>n</i>a of a crime which causes loss of caste, or of a minor offence which does not cause loss of caste, he shall subsist during a month on water (only), and constantly repeat the (<i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as called) <i>S</i>uddhavatîs; <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">39</font></a></p>  
 <p>40. Or he may go to bathe (with the priests) at (the conclusion of) a horse-sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>41. By this (rule the penance for) intercourse with a female of the <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla caste has been declared. <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">41</font></a></p>  
 <p>42. Now (follows the description of) another K<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra penance, applicable to all (men), where (the rule given above) has been altered.</p>  
 <p>43. On one day (let him eat) in the morning (only), on the (following) day at night (only), on the (next) day food given without asking, and on the (fourth) day (let him) fast; the succeeding (three) periods of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a></p>  
 <p>four days (must be passed) in the same manner. Wishing to show favour to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Manu, the chief among the pillars of the law, has thus described the <i>S</i>isuk<i>ri</i><i>k</i><i>kh</i>ra (the hard penance of children) for infants, aged, and sick men.</p>  
 <p>44. Now follows the rule for (the performance of) the <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a (lunar penance). <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">44</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. On the first day of the dark half (of the month) let him eat fourteen (mouthfuls), let him diminish the (number of) mouthfuls (each day by one), and continue in this manner until the end of the fortnight. In like manner let him eat one mouthful on the first day of the bright half, and (daily) increasing (the number 6f) mouthfuls, continue until the end of the fortnight.</p>  
 <p>46. Meanwhile let him sing Sâmans, or mutter the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis.</p>  
 <p>47. A month during which he thus performs a <i>K</i>ândrâya<i>n</i>a, the <i>Ri</i>shis have called by way of laudation, 'a means of purification' (pavitra). It is prescribed as an expiation of all (offences) for which no (special penance) has been mentioned.</p>

But a parallel passage of Devala, which K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita quotes, makes, I think, the version given above appear preferable. In either case the passage is explained by the fact that, according to the <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a, <i>S</i>vetaketu, one of the great teachers of the White Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, strongly pleaded for the use of honey; see Weber, Indische Studien X, 123 seq.</p>

The Sûtra is badly corrupted in K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>apa<i>n</i><i>d</i>ita's edition. I read kaṅka instead of vaṅka, leave out vâyasa after bhâsa, and change kâkolûkânâ<i>m</i> sâdane to kâkolûkamâ<i>m</i>sâdane. The latter change is absolutely necessary; firstly, because the penances for killing dogs and men have been given above; secondly, because the word mânusha requires a noun which it qualifies at the end of the compound; thirdly, because the penance which is prescribed, fasting until the entrails are empty, is absurd for murder, but appropriate for eating forbidden food; and fourthly, because the parallel passages of other Sm<i>ri</i>tis actually do prescribe it for eating the flesh of excessively impure animals and for cannibalism. The change of amâ to ânâ is a very common mistake in Devanâgarî MSS.</p>
