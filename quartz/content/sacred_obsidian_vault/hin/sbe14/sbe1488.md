 <p>1. The (eleven Anuvâkas called) Rudras together with (the ten hymns) seen by Madhu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas, the Gâyatrî with the syllable Om, and likewise the seven Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis (are the texts) which should be muttered (and) which remove guilt. <a name="fr_1455"></a><a href="#fn_1455"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. The M<i>ri</i>gâresh<i>t</i>i, the Pavitresh<i>t</i>i, the Trihavis, the Pâvamânî are the Ish<i>t</i>is which efface sin, if they are (each) combined with the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (Dvâda<i>s</i>akapâla). <a name="fr_1456"></a><a href="#fn_1456"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3-4. Learn, also, the following most excellent secret; he will be freed from all sins of all kinds who sprinkles himself with water, reciting the Pavitras, who mutters the eleven (Anuvâkas called) Rudras, who offers burnt oblations of butter, reciting the Pavitras, and gives gold, a cow, and sesamum (to Brâhma<i>n</i>as).</p>  
 <p>5. He who partakes of boiled barley-gruel, mixed with cow's urine, liquid cowdung, sour milk, milk, and butter, is quickly freed from sin. <a name="fr_1457"></a><a href="#fn_1457"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Both he who has begotten a child on a <i>S</i>ûdra woman and he who has had connexion with a female, <a name="fr_1458"></a><a href="#fn_1458"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>

 <p>intercourse with whom is forbidden (agamyâ), are purified (if they live) according to this rule during seven days.</p>  
 <p>7. (That is likewise) the remedy when one has swallowed semen, ordure, and urine, or eaten the food of persons whose food must not be eaten, (and also) when a younger brother has kindled the sacred fire, has offered a <i>S</i>rauta sacrifice, or taken a wife before the elder. <a name="fr_1459"></a><a href="#fn_1459"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. He who has committed even a great number of (wicked) actions, excepting mortal sins, will be freed (by that rule) from all guilt. That is the statement of the virtuous.</p>  
 <p>9. But (this) ordinance, which is based on the authority of the sacred texts, is stated (to be that) through which Bharadvâ<i>g</i>a and others became equal to Brahman,</p>  
 <p>10. Through the performance of these rites a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, whose heart is full of peace, obtains whatever desires he may have in his heart.</p>
