 <p>1. If, untired, he performs three suppressions of his breath according to the rule, the sins which he committed during a day and a night are instantly destroyed. <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Seated during the evening prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of his breath all guilt which <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p>he incurred during the day by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.</p>  
 <p>3. But standing during the morning prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of his breath all guilt which he incurred during the night by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.</p>  
 <p>4. But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied by (the recitation of) the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis and the syllable Om, repeated daily, purify after a month even the slayer of a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Even a drinker of spirituous liquor becomes pure, if he mutters the (hymn seen) by Kutsa, 'Apa na<i>h</i> sosu<i>k</i>ad agham,' and (the hymn seen) by Vasish<i>th</i>a (which begins with the word) 'Prati,' the Mâhitra (hymn), and the <i>S</i>uddhavatîs. <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. Even he who has stolen gold becomes instantly free from guilt, if he once mutters (the hymn beginning with the words) 'Asya vâmasya' and the <i>S</i>ivasa<i>m</i>kalpa. <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. The violator of a Guru's bed is freed (from sin) if he repeatedly recites the (hymn beginning) 'Havish pântam a<i>g</i>aram' and that (beginning) 'Na tam a<i>m</i>ha<i>h</i>' and mutters the hymn addressed to Purusha. <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. Or plunging into water he may thrice mutter the Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a. Manu has declared that the (effect is the) same as if he had gone to bathe at a horse-sacrifice. <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>9. An offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice at which animals are killed; a (prayer) which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred texts) one thousand times. <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. The four Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules of the Veda are all together not equal in value to the sixteenth part of a sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers. <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. But, undoubtedly, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only; whether he perform other (rites) or neglect them, he is called a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who befriends all creatures (maitra). <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. The sins of those who are intent on muttering prayers, of those who offer burnt-oblations, of those who are given to meditation, of those who reside in sacred places, and of those who have bathed after performing the vows called <i>S</i>iras, do not remain. <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. As a fire, fanned by wind, burns brighter, and (as its flame grows) through offerings (of butter), even so a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who is daily engaged in</p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p>  
 <p>muttering sacred texts shines with a brilliant lustre.</p>  
 <p>14. The destruction of those who fulfil the duty of daily study, who constantly restrain themselves, who mutter prayers and offer sacrifices has never been known (to happen). <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. Let him who is desirous of purification repeat, though he be charged with all sins, the divine (Gâyatrî), at the most one thousand times, or one hundred times as a medium (penance), or at least ten times (for trivial faults).</p>  
 <p>16. A Kshatriya shall pass through misfortunes which have befallen him by the strength of his arms, a Vai<i>s</i>ya and <i>S</i>ûdra by their wealth, the highest among twice-born men by muttered prayers and burnt-oblations.</p>  
 <p>17. As horses (are useless) without a chariot, as chariots (are useless) without horses, even so austerity (is useless) to him who is destitute of sacred learning, and sacred learning to him who practises no austerities.</p>  
 <p>18. As food mixed with honey, or honey mixed with food, even so are austerities and learning, joined together, a powerful medicine.</p>  
 <p>19. No guilt taints a Brâhma<i>n</i>a who possesses learning, practises austerities, and daily mutters sacred texts, though he may constantly commit sinful acts.</p>
