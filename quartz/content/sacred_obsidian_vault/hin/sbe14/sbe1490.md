   <h3 align="center">PRA<i>S</i>NA IV, ADHYÂYA 8.</h3>  
 <p>1. He who, through excessive greed or carelessness, performs this rite for others, is tainted by sin, and perishes like one who has swallowed poison.</p>  
 <p>2. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a who performs this rite for his teacher, his father, his mother, or for himself is resplendent like the sun. Therefore this rite may be performed for those (persons).</p>  
 <p>3. Ka (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) purified by means of this rite the god with a thousand eyes (Sahasrâksha), Fire, Wind, the Sun, Soma, Yama, and other lords of the gods.</p>  
 <p>4. Whatever there is in these three worlds, famed as possessing a holy name, Brâhma<i>n</i>as and the rest, (all) that was produced by Ka through this rite of sanctification.</p>  
 <p>5. This sin-destroying secret of Pra<i>g</i>âpati was first produced; thereafter thousands of purificatory rites .came into existence. <a name="fr_1462"></a><a href="#fn_1462"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. He who performs those eight Ga<i>n</i>ahomas on the (first) day of the year, of a half-year, of a season, or of a fortnight, sanctifies ten ancestors and ten descendants of his line;</p>  
 <p>7. And, while still on earth, he is known to the</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>gods in heaven as a holy man, and (after death) that virtuous man rejoices for a very long time in heaven like a god.</p>  
 <p>8. If a Brâhma<i>n</i>a is unable to offer those eight Ga<i>n</i>ahomas, let him offer one; thereby his guilt is effaced.</p>  
 <p>9. He, also, whose sons or pupils offer those eight Ga<i>n</i>ahomas, is freed from his sin which is bought off by his having instructed (them).</p>  
 <p>10. Through a desire of removing one's guilt one even may cause (these oblations) to be offered by men who have been engaged for money, in case oneself is unable (to do it); a man need not torment himself. <a name="fr_1463"></a><a href="#fn_1463"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Even among the virtuous a distribution of wealth is made (for the success) of holy rites; some-times a man who is free from debt is (thereby) freed from guilt.</p>  
 <p>12, Liberated according to this rule from the ocean of guilt and debt, he considers himself pure and able to successfully perform the sacred rites.</p>  
 <p>13. But in the case of that pure mortal who, freed from all sin and debts, begins the sacred rites, they will succeed without any effort.</p>  
 <p>14. Let him daily (study and) teach this holy (rule) of Pra<i>g</i>âpati, which the sage has proclaimed, let him remember it or hear it. (By doing that) he is freed from all guilt and will be exalted in Brahman's world.</p>  
 <p>

 <p>15. Let him mutter during twelve days those sacred texts through which he wishes to accomplish (his desires), eating once (a day) at night boiled rice with clarified butter, with milk, or with sour milk.</p>  
 <p>16. (Let him offer) ten times a burnt oblation and sprinkle clarified butter. (That is) the preliminary worship (which must be performed) when one desires to accomplish one's objects through those sacred texts.</p>

Though the hired performer will be guilty of a serious offence (Sûtra 1), the person who causes them to be performed will derive benefit from them.</p>
