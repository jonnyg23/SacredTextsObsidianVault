 <p>1. Now we will explain the oblations (offered) to the vital air (prâ<i>n</i>a) by <i>S</i>âlînas (householders) and Yâyâvaras (vagrants), who sacrifice to the soul. <a name="fr_1259"></a><a href="#fn_1259"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. At the end of all the necessary (daily rites), let him sit down, facing the east, in a place that has been well cleaned and smeared with cowdung; next let him worship that prepared (food) which is being brought. (saying), 'Bhû<i>h</i>, Bhuva<i>h</i>, Sva<i>h</i>, Om,' (and then) remain silent.</p>  
 <p>3. (Next) he pours water round the food which has been placed (before him), turning his right hand towards it, and reciting the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis; (afterwards), continuing to hold (the dish) with his left hand, he first drinks water, (saying), 'Thou art a substratum for ambrosia,' and (finally) offers five oblations of food to the vital airs, (reciting the <a name="fr_1260"></a><a href="#fn_1260"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>texts), 'Full of reverence, I offer ambrosia to Prâ<i>n</i>a; mayest thou propitiously enter me, not in order to burn me. To Prâ<i>n</i>a, Svâhâ!' &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>4. After offering the five oblations of food to the vital airs, let him finish his meal silently. Meditating in his heart on the lord of created beings, let him not emit speech while (eating),</p>  
 <p>5. If he emits speech, he shall mutter 'Bhû<i>h</i>, Bhuva<i>h</i>, Sva<i>h</i>, Om,' and afterwards continue to eat.</p>  
 <p>6. Now they quote also (the following rule): 'If he sees (bits of) skin, hair, nail-(parings), insects, or the dung of rats (in his food), 'he shall take out a lump, sprinkle that spot with water, scatter ashes on it, again sprinkle it with water, and use (the remainder of the food), after it has been declared fit (for use).' <a name="fr_1261"></a><a href="#fn_1261"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He shall eat, seated with his face towards the east, silent, not despising his food, not scattering (fragments on the ground), and solely attend (to his dinner); and, after he has eaten, he shall touch fire.' <a name="fr_1262"></a><a href="#fn_1262"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. He shall not cut off with his teeth (pieces from) eatables (that must be swallowed) entire, (such as) cakes, bulbs, roots, fruit, and flesh.</p>  
 <p>9. (Let him) not (eat) to repletion. <a name="fr_1263"></a><a href="#fn_1263"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. After (dinner) he shall drink water, (reciting the text), 'Thou art 'a covering for ambrosia,' and stroke (the region of) the heart, (saying), 'Thou art the bond that connects the vital airs; (thou art) <a name="fr_1264"></a><a href="#fn_1264"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>

 <p>11. After sipping water a second time, he allows (the drops from) the hand to flow on the big toe of his right foot (and recites the following text): 'May the male be pleased, he who is of the size of a thumb, who occupies (a space of the size of) a thumb, who is the lord of the whole world, masterful, and the enjoyer of the universe.' <a name="fr_1265"></a><a href="#fn_1265"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Let him perform the subsequent consecration (anumantra<i>n</i>a) of the (food which has been) offered, with raised arms, (and let him recite) the five (texts beginning), 'With faith, worshipping Prâ<i>n</i>a, (I have) offered ambrosia; mayest thou increase Prâ<i>n</i>a through this food,' <a name="fr_1266"></a><a href="#fn_1266"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. (And let him address the soul with the last text of the Anuvâka), '(May) my soul (gain) immortality in the universal soul.'</p>  
 <p>14. And let him (meditate on his) soul (as) united with the imperishable (syllable Om). <a name="fr_1267"></a><a href="#fn_1267"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. He who sacrifices to the soul, surpasses him who offers all sacrifices.</p>
