 <p>§ 23. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brahma the Destroyer</span>.—As we saw, the Upanishads are full of cosmogonies inherited from Vedic religion; but apparently they have not yet arrived at the belief in a periodical course of alternate creation, maintenance, and dissolution of worlds which later became general in India.
