 <p>§ 21. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Freedom of Will</span>.—It follows that in so far as man shares in the empiric world his whole moral and physical life is at every instant strictly predestined. But at the same time his Self is implicitly free, inasmuch as in essence it is one with the Absolute Brahma, no matter how it be empirically sunk in the phenomenal world; and as soon as he attains the knowledge of this fundamental unity which is itself salvation, his freedom is complete; he is the One Absolute Brahma, and beside him there exists no empiric world. <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="brk25.htm#fn_2"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
