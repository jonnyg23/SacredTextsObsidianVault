Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h4 align="center">XIII. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Light And Darkness</span> <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">1</font></a></h4>  
 <p>In the Lord is to be veiled this universe, whatsoever stirs in the world. With renunciation thereof <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">2</font></a> thou mayst enjoy; lust thou after the wealth of none.</p>

 <p>One may seek to live a hundred years doing works here. So it is with thee, not otherwise; his work defiles not man. <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Dæmonic are in sooth these worlds, veiled in blind darkness; into them pass after death whatsoever folk slay their own souls.</p>  
 <p>The One, unstirring, is yet swifter than the mind; the gods cannot reach it as it travels before. Standing it outspeeds others that run; in it the Wind-spirit lays the waters.</p>  
 <p>It stirs, and stirs not; it is far, and near. It is within all, and outside all that is.</p>  
 <p>But he who discerns all creatures in his Self, and his Self in all creatures, has no disquiet thence.</p>  
 <p>What delusion, what grief can be with him in whom all creatures have become the very self of the thinker discerning their oneness?</p>  
 <p>He has spread around, a thing bright, bodiless, taking no hurt, sinewless, pure, unsmitten by evil; a sage, wise, encompassing, self-existent, he has duly assigned purposes for all time.</p>  
 <p>Into blind darkness pass they who worship Ignorance; into still greater dark they who are content with Knowledge. <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is neither what comes by Knowledge, they</p>

 <p>say, nor what comes by Ignorance; thus have we heard from the sages who taught us this lore.</p>  
 <p>He who understands both Knowledge and Ignorance <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a> passes by Ignorance over death and by Knowledge enjoys deathlessness.</p>  
 <p>Into blind darkness pass they who worship Change-into-naught; into still greater dark they who worship Change-into-aught. <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is neither what comes by Change-into-aught, they say, nor what comes by Change-into-naught; thus have we heard from the sages who taught us this lore.</p>  
 <p>He who understands <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">3</font></a> both Change-into-aught and Destruction passes by Destruction over death and by Change-into-aught enjoys deathlessness.</p>  
 <p>The face of truth is covered with a golden bowl. O Pūshan, remove it, that the keeper of truths may see. <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>O Pūshan, sole seer, O Yama, Sun, child of</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Prajā-pati, part asunder thy rays, mass together thy radiance. I see that fairest shape of thee. Yonder, yonder spirit am I.</p>  
 <p>The breath to the everlasting wind; and be this body ended in ashes.</p>  
 <p>Om! remember, O my spirit, remember the work! remember, O my spirit, remember the work! O Fire, lead us by good ways to riches, thou god who knowest all courses; keep far from us crooked sin, and we will offer to thee exceeding homage and praise. <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="brk42.htm#fn_56"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_48"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_48">88:1</a> The Īśāvāsya or Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā Upanishad.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_49"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_49">88:2</a>Viz. of the phenomenal world of sense-perception.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_50"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_50">89:1</a> Provided he has knowledge of Brahma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_51"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_51">89:2</a> "Ignorance" probably means the conception of the phenomenal world as really existent in itself; "Knowledge," the attempt to trace the universe back to a first principle different from the Self.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_52">90:1</a> Viz. he who knows both these forms of knowledge to be delusive.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_53">90:2</a> The author here attacks those who believe that Being undergoes change either into non-being or into a different phase of being. His cardinal principle is that Being is one and changeless.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_54"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_54">90:3</a> I.e., he who knows both ideas to be false.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_55"></a><a href="brk41.htm#fr_55">90:4</a> This and the following verses (a death-bed prayer, according to tradition) are a prayer to the Sun-god to reveal the figure of the <i>Purusha</i> in the sun (corresponding to the figure in the human eye, and symbolic of Brahma; see p. 16). The Sun-god is here identified with Yama, the ruler of the dead. On Prajā-pati, see p. 14; in the next extract he is mythically represented as a teacher of philosophic lore.</p>
