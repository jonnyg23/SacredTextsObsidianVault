 <p><a name="fn_244"></a><a href="sbe3318.htm#fr_244">80:149</a> Definitions of the eleven witnesses are given in the following paragraphs. A.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_245"></a><a href="sbe3318.htm#fr_245">80:150</a> 'A subscribing witness,' i.e. one by whom a document is attested. 'A secret witness,' one who concealed in a house or room listens to the discourse of the parties. A. Kâtyâyana defines the technical terms in this paragraph as follows: 'One adduced by the claimant himself, whose name is inserted in the deed, is a subscribing witness. A reminded witness is not entered in a deed. He is called a reminded witness who in order to insure the publicity of a transaction is reminded of it again and again by the claimant. One purposely brought near, and one who happened to be on the spot accidentally, are two witnesses not entered in a deed, by whom a claim may be corroborated. One who standing concealed is caused, for the purpose of establishing the claim, to hear distinctly the statements of the defendant, is termed a secret witness. One who subsequently corroborates the statements of other witnesses, whether from his own knowledge, or from hearsay, is called an indirect witness.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_246"></a><a href="sbe3318.htm#fr_246">81:151</a> 151, 152. The village or the co-villagers shall be witnesses in a transaction which has taken place within the village. The testimony of the judge shall be heard in regard to a cause tried in a court of justice. The king shall be witness concerning a transaction which has taken place in his presence. These, and one acquainted with the circumstances of both parties, the agent of the claimant, and members of a family in a lawsuit concerning that family, are the six kinds of witnesses not appointed.

 <p><a name="fn_247"></a><a href="sbe3318.htm#fr_247">81:153</a> 'Of honourable family,' belonging to a noble race. 'Straightforward,' habitually veracious. 'Less than three,' viz. one or two persons may be witnesses if both parties consent to it. In a dispute regarding landed property, more than three witnesses are required. 'Honest,' free from avarice. 'Pure-minded,' imbued with the precepts of religion. A. Manu VIII, 62, 63; Vish<i>n</i>u VIII, 8; Âpastamba II, 11, 29, 7; Gautama XIII, 2; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya II, 68, 69; Vasish<i>th</i>a XVI, 28.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="sbe3318.htm#fr_250">82:156</a> If in a company of traders any one member should contract an enmity towards the other members of it, they are unworthy to bear testimony against or about him, on account of their enmity towards him.
