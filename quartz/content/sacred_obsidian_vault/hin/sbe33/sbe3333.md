 <p>343. <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">343</font></a> Now I shall give a description of the ordeal of the hot piece of gold, which has been ordained by Brahman himself for the purpose of distinguishing virtue from vice.</p>  
 <p>* 344. (The judge), after having cleansed himself, shall quickly pour clarified butter into a golden, silver, iron, or earthen vessel, and shall place the vessel on the fire.</p>  
 <p>* 345. He shall throw into it a shining coin, made k of gold, silver, copper, or iron, after having washed it in water more than once.</p>  
 <p>* 346. <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">346</font></a> Should (the coin) ever drop into the boiling (mixture), it would be a very dangerous thing to touch him (the fire?). Therefore he must address the clarified butter with the following prayer:</p>  
 <p>* 347. Thou art the best instrument of purification, O clarified butter, and (comparable to) Ambrosia</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>at a sacrifice. Burn this man at once if he is criminal, and be as cold as ice to him if he is innocent.</p>  
 <p>* 348. <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">348</font></a> If, on touching and examining the forefinger (of the defendant) it is found to be unhurt and to show no boils, he is innocent. Otherwise, he is not (innocent).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_341"></a><a href="sbe3333.htm#fr_341">119:343</a> 343-348. The ordeal of the hot piece of gold (Taptamâsha) derives its name from the gold coin (mâsha) or signet-ring (mudrikâ), which those who are tried by this ordeal are required to pick out of a vessel filled with a boiling liquid, with the thumb and forefinger. They are declared innocent, if the hand remains unhurt.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_342"></a><a href="sbe3333.htm#fr_342">119:346</a> The reading of the first half of this paragraph is quite uncertain, and the above rendering conjectural.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_343"></a><a href="sbe3333.htm#fr_343">120:348</a> Some writers refer to two further ordeals, besides the seven kinds mentioned by Nârada. One of them is the ordeal of the red-hot ploughshare, which the defendant is made to lick. The other consists of drawing lots.</p>
