 <p>1. <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">1</font></a> Immediately after deposits, sale by another person than the owner has been declared by Bh<i>ri</i>gu; listen attentively, I will expound that subject thoroughly.</p>

 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 335</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">2</font></a> An open deposit, a bailment for delivery (Anvâhita), a Nyâsa (sealed) deposit, stolen property, a pledge, or what has been borrowed for use: when any one of these articles has been sold in secret by a man, he is declared a person different from the owner (asvâmin).</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_1079"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">3</font></a> When the vendor has been produced and has been cast in the suit, (the judge) shall cause him to pay the price and a fine to the buyer and king respectively, and to restore the property to the owner.</p>  
 <p>4. <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">4</font></a> When the former owner comes forward and makes good his claim to the thing bought, the vendor shall be produced (by the purchaser); by doing so, the purchaser may clear himself.</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">5</font></a> That greedy man who covets another man's property, without having any claim to it, shall be compelled to pay twice the value (of the property claimed) as a fine, if he is unable to prove his claim.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">6</font></a> When there is no evidence in a suit, the king shall consider the character of the parties and pass a decree himself, according to the equal, greater, or less (credibility of the parties).</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">7</font></a> When a purchase has been made before an assembly of merchants, the king's officers being aware of it (also), but from a vendor whose habitation is unknown; or when the purchaser has deceased:</p>  
 <p>8. The owner may recover his own property by</p>

 <p>paying half the price (tendered), the custom in that case being that one half of the value is lost to each of the two.</p>  
 <p>9. A purchase from an unknown (vendor) is one fault (in that case); want of care in keeping it is another; these two faults are viewed by the wise as legitimate grounds of loss to each party.</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">10</font></a> When a man purchases (a commodity) at a fair price, and (the purchase) has been previously announced to the king, there is no wrong about it; but he who makes a fraudulent purchase is a thief.</p>  
 <p>11. That should be known as a fraudulent purchase which is made at an unreasonably low price, in the interior of a house, outside of the village, at night, in secret, or from a dishonest person.</p>

In 10, Colebrooke has 'delivered by the owner in the presence of credible persons.' I have translated the reading of the Vîramitrodaya, 'previously announced to the king.' In 11, the clause 'in secret' is omitted in the Vîramitrodaya.</p>
