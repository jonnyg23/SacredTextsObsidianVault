 <p>P. <a href="sbe3350.htm#page_231">231</a>, Appendix v. 56. This difficult text, together with an additional text, is quoted in a somewhat different, but equally faulty form, in the recently published last fasciculus of the Vivâdaratnâkara in the Bibliotheca Indica. I propose to render the two texts as follows: 'Fines beginning with a Kârshâpa<i>n</i>a may amount to four Kârshâpa<i>n</i>as at most (in heavy cases); there are others beginning with two and rising to eight, or beginning with three and rising to twelve Kârshâpa<i>n</i>as. All those (fines) which have been declared to begin with one Kârshâpa<i>n</i>a may be raised to the fourfold amount; the same rule applies to the other fines as well, excepting the highest fine (which consists of 2500 Pa<i>n</i>as).'</p>  
 <p>P. <a href="sbe3382.htm#page_369">369</a>, <i>after</i> v. 14, <i>add</i> '15. A wife should be honoured by her husband with (presents of) clothes, ornaments, and food; and at a festival (she should receive similar presents) from her father and brothers, her parents-in-law, and other relations.'</p>
