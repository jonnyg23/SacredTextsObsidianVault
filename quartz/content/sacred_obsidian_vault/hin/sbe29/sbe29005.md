 <p>4 <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">4</font></a>. In the oblations of cooked food the acts of taking (the intended oblation), of putting it down (near the fire), and of sprinkling it (with water) are performed with regard to the deities of the (respective) Mantras.</p>

 <p>8 <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">8</font></a>. And some say that the morning oblation may be made at the time of the evening oblation, in the case of danger.</p>  
 <p>9. But the time is fixed, as at the Agnihotra an expiation has been prescribed for him who has neglected the time.</p>  
 <p>10. At the two daily oblations one should use as sacrificial food either rice or barley or grains.</p>  
 <p>11. In case these are not at hand, other (sorts of sacrificial food are) not prohibited.</p>  
 <p>12. Some say that if he uses grains, he should wash them.</p>  
 <p>13. With the other (kinds of food) no such preparation takes place.</p>

 <p>The deities of the festivals of the new and full moon (i.e. of the rites which in the <i>S</i>rauta ritual correspond to that taught here) are, at the full moon, Agni and Agnîshomau, at the new moon, Agni, Vish<i>n</i>u, and Indrâgnî, who are preceded in both cases by Agni and Soma as the deities of the two â<i>g</i>yabhâgas (see below, ch. 9, 7), and followed by Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t.

A number of ceremonies common to the Sthâlîpâka ritual and to the ordinary ritual of Â<i>g</i>ya oblations, such as the strewing of Ku<i>s</i>a grass round the fire, the ceremonies regarding the Pavitras (strainers), &amp;c., have to be supplied here from the Â<i>g</i>ya ritual given below (ch. 7 seq.); this may be looked upon as an argument in favour of our conjecture which will be stated in the preface (vol. ii of the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras), that our text, as probably is the case also with the Pâraskara-sûtra, is based on an original, the opening sentences of which are preserved to us in <i>S</i>âṅkh. I, 5, 1-5 = Pâraskara I, 4, 1-5, so that the first chapters of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, and among them the exposition of the festivals of the full and new moon, would have been prefixed to the original commencement of the text.</p>
