 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe29141.htm#fr_551">227:6</a> 8, 6. 'On high' means 'not on the ground' (Nârâya<i>n</i>a). On the gaudânika<i>m</i> karma (the shaving of the beard), comp. above, Adhyâya I, Ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikâ 18. The word 'ceremony' would mean here, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, that he should perform the rite alone, without observing such prescriptions as stated above, I, 18, 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe29141.htm#fr_552">227:7</a> Thus, instead of 'Herb! protect him!' (I, 17, 8) he is to say, 'Herb! protect me!' and so on.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe29141.htm#fr_553">227:8</a> Ekaklîtaka is, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a and the Prayogaratna, the seed of such a Kara<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a fruit (Pongamia Glabra, Vent.) which contains only one grain of seed. Such grains are pounded before he rubs himself therewith.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe29141.htm#fr_554">228:21</a> On the hymn beginning with the words 'Giving life,' see Prof. Stenzler's note on this Sûtra. Its first verse is identical with Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi Sa<i>m</i>hitâ XXXIV, 50 (comp. also <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 1, 7), and so are most of its verses found in that Sa<i>m</i>hitâ or in the Atharva-veda; the whole of it occurs among the Rig-veda Khilas (vol. vi, p. 25, 2-12).</p>
