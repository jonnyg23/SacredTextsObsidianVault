 <p>5 <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food and having sacrificed the two Â<i>g</i>ya portions, he sacrifices Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the texts):</p>  
 <p>(a <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">a</font></a>) 'Thirty sisters go to the appointed place,</p>

 <p>putting on the same badge. They spread out the seasons, the knowing sages; having the metres in their midst they walk around, the brilliant ones. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(b) 'The shining one clothes herself with clouds, with the ways of the sun, the divine night: manifold animals which are born, look about in this mother's lap. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(c) 'The Ekâsh<i>t</i>akâ, devoting herself to austerities, has given birth to a child, to the majesty of Indra. Through him the gods have conquered the hostile tribes; he became the killer of the Asuras through his (divine) powers. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(d <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">d</font></a>) 'You have made me who am not the younger (sister), the younger; speaking the truth I desire this: may I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.</p>  
 <p>(e) 'In my favour dwelt the omniscient one; he has found a firm standing; he has got a footing. May I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.</p>  
 <p>(f <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">f</font></a>) 'On the five dawns follows the fivefold milking; on the cow with the five names, the rive seasons. The five regions (of the sky) are established</p>

 <p>through the fifteenfold (Stoma); with one common face (they look over) the one world. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(g) 'She who shone forth as the first, is the child of truth. One (of them) bears the majesty of the waters; one wanders in the courses of the sun; one (in those) of the heat; Savit<i>ri</i> shall govern one. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(h) 'She who shone forth as the first has become a cow in Yama's realm. Give us milk, thou who art rich in milk, year by year. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(i <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">i</font></a>) 'She, the owner of bright bulls, has come to us with clouds and with light, she who has all shapes, the motley one, whose banner is fire. Carrying on the common work, leading us to old age, come to us thou who art exempt from old age, Ushas! Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(k) 'The consort of the seasons, the first one has come to us, the leader of days, the producer of offspring. Being one, thou shinest manifold, Ushas. Being free from old age, thou leadest to old age everything else. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">6</font></a>. He makes offerings of the mess of cooked food with (the verses):</p>

 <p>may the heavens give us bliss and safety. May the points (of the horizon), the intermediate points, the upper points give us bliss, and may day and night create long life for us. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'May the waters, the rays protect us from all sides; may the creator, may the ocean turn away evil. The present and the future, may all be safe for me. Protected by Brahman, may I be well guarded. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'May all Âdityas and the divine Vasus, may the Rudras and Maruts be our protectors. May Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the highest lord, bestow on us vigour, offspring, immortality, long life. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>7. And with (the formula), 'To the Ash<i>t</i>akâ Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>8. The middle Ash<i>t</i>akâ (is celebrated) with (the sacrifice of) a cow.</p>  
 <p>9. He sacrifices the omentum of that (cow) with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, O <i>G</i>âtavedas, to the fathers' (Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. XXXV, 20).</p>  
 <p>10. On the day following each (Ash<i>t</i>akâ), the Anvash<i>t</i>akâ day, (he brings a sacrifice) with the left ribs and the left thigh, in an enclosure, according to (the ritual of) the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>apit<i>ri</i>ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a.</p>  
 <p>11. Also to the female (ancestors he makes Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a offerings) and pours (for them) strong liquor and water oblations into pits, and (offers) collyrium, salves, and garlands.</p>  
 <p>12. (He may also make oblations), if he likes, to the teacher and to the pupils who have no children.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_875"></a><a href="sbe29192.htm#fr_876">341:14</a> The verse occurs, with a few differences, in the Kâ<i>n</i>va <i>S</i>âkhâ of the Vâ<i>g</i>. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ, II, 7, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_876"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_877">341:1</a> 3, 1. On the Ash<i>t</i>akâs, celebrated on the eighth days of the three dark fortnights following after the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î full moon, see <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana III, 12 seqq.; Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, 4; Gobhila III, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_877"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_878">341:2</a> As there are four deities named, I think it probable that they are referred to all Ash<i>t</i>akâs indiscriminately; comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, 4, 12. Thus in the Mantras prescribed for the first Ash<i>t</i>akâ (Sûtras 5 and 6), Indra, the Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati are named; to the Fathers belongs the Anvash<i>t</i>akya ceremony.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_878"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_879">341:3</a> With regard to the order of these substances the G<i>ri</i>hya texts differ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_879"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_880">341:5</a> Comp. Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>hitâ IV, 3, 11; Atharva-veda III, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_880"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_881">341:a</a> (a) The thirty sisters seem to be the days of the month. As to <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a> madhye<i>kh</i>andas, comp. Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. loc. cit. § 1: <i>kh</i>andasvatî ushasâ pepi<i>s</i>âne; § 2: <i>k</i>atush<i>t</i>omo abhavad yâ turîyâ ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>asya pakshâv <i>ri</i>shayo bhavantî, gâyatrî<i>m</i> trish<i>t</i>ubha<i>m</i> <i>g</i>agatîm anush<i>t</i>ubham b<i>ri</i>had arka<i>m</i> yu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ânâ<i>h</i> suvar â<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>bharann idam.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_881"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_882">342:d</a> (d) Probably one Ash<i>t</i>akâ addresses the others, her sisters, as <i>G</i>ayarâma explains this verse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_882"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_883">342:f</a> (f) The explanation by which the 'fivefold milking' is referred to what is called in Taitt. Brâhma<i>n</i>a II, 2, 9, 'the milkings of Pra<i>g</i>âpati,' seems to me more than doubtful, for 'the milkings <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a> of Pra<i>g</i>âpati' are only four: viz. the dark night, the moonlight, the twilight, and the day.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_883"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_884">343:i</a> (i) Sukra-<i>ri</i>shabhâ cannot be translated, as Professor Stenzler does, 'die schönste unter den Lichtern' (Mâdhava: <i>s</i>ukreshu nakshatrâdishu <i>s</i>resh<i>th</i>â), for this meaning of <i>ri</i>shabhâ occurs only in later texts. The word is a Bahuvrîhi compound, as the Petersburg Dictionary explains it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_884"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_885">343:6</a> In the first verse I have omitted vya<i>s</i>navai, which impedes the construction and violates the metre. The word has found its way into the text, no doubt, in consequence of the phrase dîrgham âyur vya<i>s</i>navai occurring in chap. 2, 2. In the second verse <a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344</font></a> ak<i>ri</i>tad is corrupt. I have translated abhayam; comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana II, 4, 14. In the third verse I have left out mayi, as Professor Stenzler has done in his translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_885"></a><a href="sbe29193.htm#fr_886">345:13</a> I have stated in the note on <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana III, 13, 1 my reasons for believing that the true reading of this Sûtra is not madhyâvarshe (in the middle of the rainy season), but mâghyavarshe (the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghâs). There are no express rules given with regard to the third Ash<i>t</i>akâ, but I think we should understand this Sûtra as involving a statement on that Ash<i>t</i>akâ: (The third Ash<i>t</i>akâ) and the fourth, on the Mâghyavarsha day, are Sâkâsh<i>t</i>akâs (Ash<i>t</i>akâs on which vegetables are offered). <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana (G<i>ri</i>hya III, 13, 1) declares that the ritual of the fourth Ash<i>t</i>akâ is identical with that of the second.</p>
