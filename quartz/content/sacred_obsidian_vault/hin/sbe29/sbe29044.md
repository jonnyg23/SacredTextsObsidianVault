 <p>svâhâ!'having thus offered the oblations belonging to those deities,</p>  
 <p>5. He then shall offer Balis (i.e. portions of food) in the centre of the floor to the same deities; (then another Bali with the words,) 'Adoration to Brahman and to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as!' and (with the verse), 'Vâstoshpati, accept us' (Rig-veda VII, 54, 1) in the centre of the floor to Vâstoshpati.</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">6-7</font></a>. He then distributes Balis, from the left to the right, through the different quarters (of the horizon, to the presiding deities) in due order (with the words),</p>  
 <p>7. 'Adoration to Indra and to those belonging to Indra! Adoration to Yama and to those belonging to Yama! Adoration to Varu<i>n</i>a and to those belonging to Varu<i>n</i>a! Adoration to Soma and to those belonging to Soma! Adoration to B<i>ri</i>haspati and to those belonging to B<i>ri</i>haspati!'</p>  
 <p>8 <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">8</font></a>. Then (turned) towards the disk of the sun, 'Adoration to Aditi and to the Âdityas! Adoration</p>  
 <p>5. 'He shall offer a Bali to those deities, i.e. to those ten deities to whom he has sacrificed, to Agni, &amp;c. (see Sûtra 4), addressing them with the word, "Adoration (to such and such a deity")because in the other cases the word "adoration" (nama<i>h</i>) has been prescribed for the Bali.'

 <p>9. 'To Pûshan, the path-maker; to Dhâtar, to Vidhâtar, and to the Maruts'(thus) on the thresholds.</p>  
 <p>10. To Vish<i>n</i>u on the grindstone.</p>  
 <p>11. 'To the tree'(thus) in the mortar.</p>  
 <p>12. 'To the herbs'(thus) where the herbs are kept.</p>  
 <p>13. 'To Par<i>g</i>anya, to the waters'(thus) near the water-pot.</p>  
 <p>14. 'Adoration to <i>S</i>rî'(thus) in the bed at the head, 'to Bhadrakâlî at the foot.</p>  
 <p>15. In the privy, 'Adoration to Sarvânnabhûti!'</p>  
 <p>16. Then (he throws a Bali) into the air, in the evening with the words, 'To the night-walkers,' in the morning with the words, 'To the day-walkers,' and with the Verse,' Which gods' (Rig-veda I, 139, 11).</p>  
 <p>17. To the unknown deities to the north, and to Dhanapati (i.e. the Lord of treasures).</p>  
 <p>I8. With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder he pours out the remnant to the south with the verse, 'They whom the fire has burnt' (Rig-veda X, 15, 14).</p>  
 <p>19. When he has made his offerings to gods, fathers (i.e. Manes), and men, let him give food to a <i>S</i>rotriya (i.e. to a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a).</p>  
 <p>20. Or let him give alms (of food) to a student.</p>  
 <p>21 <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">21</font></a>. Let him immediately afterwards offer food to a female under his protection, to a pregnant woman, to boys, and to old people.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_186"></a><a href="sbe29044.htm#fr_187">84:1</a> 14, 1. The rules regarding the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva sacrifice stand here, as I have already pointed out in the German edition, p. 142, in a very strange position amid the matter that concerns the student, and before the description of the ceremony that concludes studentship (the Samâvartana; III, 1). On the first word of the chapter, atha, Nârâya<i>n</i>a observes that thereby the householder is marked as the subject of the following rules. It seems rather forced to explain the position of this chapter, as Nârâya<i>n</i>a does, by pointing out that in some cases, for instance when the teacher is away on a journey, a student also can eventually be called upon to perform the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva sacrifice (comp. below, chap. 17, 3).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_187"></a><a href="sbe29044.htm#fr_188">84:2</a> This Sûtra shows, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, that the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva offering does not follow the ordinary type of sacrifice (the Prati<i>s</i>rute homakalpa, as it is termed above, I, 9, 19), but the form described in the Agnikâryaprakara<i>n</i>a, above, chap. 10, 3 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_188"></a><a href="sbe29044.htm#fr_189">85:6-7</a> 6, 7. The distribution of Balis begins in the east, which is the part of the horizon sacred to Indra; it then proceeds to the south, the west, the north, which are sacred respectively to Yama, Varu<i>n</i>a, and Soma. Finally the Bali belonging to B<i>ri</i>haspati and the Bârhaspatyas is offered, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a, to the north-east.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_189"></a><a href="sbe29044.htm#fr_190">85:8</a> The commentators (see p. 142 of the German edition) differ as to whether âdityama<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala means the disk of the sun towards which this Bali should be offered, or a place or an apartment of circular form (âdityama<i>n</i><i>d</i>alarûpe ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>alâgâre, as in my opinion we ought to correct the reading in Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note).</p>
