 <p>1. 'Here has come to us, protecting (us) from evil words, purifying our kin as a purifier, clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with strength, this friendly goddess, this blessed girdle'with these words, three times repeated, he ties the girdle from left to right thrice round.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_129"></a><a href="sbe29032.htm#fr_130">62:6-7</a> 6, 7. A similar dialogue between the teacher and the student at the Upanayana is given in the Kau<i>s</i>ika-sûtra (ap. Weber, Indische Studien, X, 71). The student there says, 'Make me an Ârsheya (a descendant of the <i>Ri</i>shis) and one who has relations, and initiate me.' And the teacher replies, 'I make thee an Ârsheya and one who has relations, and I initiate thee.' As in this passage of the Kau<i>s</i>ika-sûtra the teacher is represented as having the power of making, by the Upanayana ceremony, an Ârsheya of the student, thus, according to the view expressed by Professor Weber (loc. cit., p. 72 seq.), <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana would even give it into the teacher's power to make the student his samânârsheya, i.e. to extend his own Ârsheya on as many pupils as he likes. Professor Weber understands the sixth Sûtra so that the teacher would have to say, samânârsheyo bhavân brûhi (Nârâya<i>n</i>a: bhavân brûhîti brahma<i>k</i>ârî bhavân brûhîty ata<i>h</i> [Sûtra 8] si<i>m</i>hâvalokananyâyenâtrânusha<i>g</i>yate. According to Râma<i>k</i>andra's Paddhati he is <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a> only to say samânârsheya<i>h</i>). The student answers, samânârsheyo ham bho; Professor Weber, who supplies the imperative asâni, translates this, 'May I have the same Ârsheya, sir!'</p>  
 <p>I think it more natural to simply translate the teacher's question, 'Art thou samânârsheya?' (or, supplying bhavân brûhi from Sûtra 8, 'Declare that thou art samânârsheya'), and the student's reply, I am samânârsheya, sir!' Thus we ought possibly to consider these formulas, which state a fictitious, ideal samânârsheyatva of the teacher and the students as a trace, and as far as I can see as the only trace, of an ancient rule requiring a real samânârsheyatva of teacher and student. As long as the ritual differences between the different Gotras, of which, as is well known, only a few traces have survived in the Vedic tradition, had retained their full importance, it can indeed scarcely have been considered as admissible that a young Brâhma<i>n</i>a should be confided to the guidance of a teacher who sacrificed and invoked the gods in another way than the customs of the pupil's own family required.</p>
