 <p>4 <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">4</font></a>. If the Dakshi<i>n</i>a fire reaches (the body) first, he should know, 'It has reached him in the world of men. He will live there in prosperity, and so will this one, i.e. his son, in this world.'</p>  
 <p>5 <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">5</font></a>. If (the three fires) reach (the body) in the same moment, they say that this signifies the highest luck.</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">6</font></a>. While (the body) is burning, he recites over it the same texts, 'Go on, go on, on the ancient paths' (Rig-veda X, 14, 7).</p>  
 <p>7. Being burnt by a person who knows this, he goes to the heaven-world together with the smoke (of the funeral pile)thus it is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti).</p>  
 <p>8 <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">8</font></a>. To the north-east of the Âhavanîya fire he should have a knee-deep pit dug and should have an Avakâ, i.e. (the water-plant called) <i>S</i>îpâla put down into it. From that (pit) he (i.e. the deceased) goes out and together with the smoke he goes up to the heaven-worldthus it is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti).</p>  
 <p>9. After he has recited (the verse), 'These living ones have separated from the dead' (Rig-veda X, 18, 3), they turn round from right to left and go away without looking back.</p>  
 <p>10 <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">10</font></a>. When they have come to a place where standing water is, having once (plunged into it and) emerged</p>

 <p>from it, they pour out one handful (of water), pronounce the Gotra name and the proper name (of the deceased), go out (of the water), put on other garments, wring out (the old garments) once, lay them away with their skirts to the north, and sit down until the stars appear.</p>  
 <p>11. Or they may enter (their houses), when still (a part) of the sun-disk is seen,</p>  
 <p>12 <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">12</font></a>. The younger ones first, the older ones last.</p>  
 <p>13. When they have come to the houses, they touch a stone, the fire, cow's dung, fried barley, sesamum seeds, and water.</p>  
 <p>14. Let them not cook food during that night.</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">15</font></a>. Let them subsist on bought or ready-made food.</p>  
 <p>16. Let them eat no saline food for three nights.</p>  
 <p>17 <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">17</font></a>. Let them optionally for twelve nights avoid the distribution of gifts and the study (of Vedic texts), if one of the chief Gurus (has died).</p>

 <p>20. And of unmarried female relations.</p>  
 <p>21 <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">21</font></a>. Three nights after (the death of) other teachers,</p>  
 <p>22. And of a relation who is no Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>a,</p>  
 <p>23. And of married female relations,</p>  
 <p>24. Of a child that has no teeth,</p>  
 <p>25. And of a dead-born child.</p>  
 <p>26. One day, after (the death of) a fellow-pupil,</p>  
 <p>27. And of a <i>S</i>rotriya of the same village.</p>
