Mitra art thou by right, Agni is thy teacher, and I, N.N., both of us. Agni, I give this student in charge to thee. Indra, I give this student in charge to thee. Sun, I give this student in charge to thee. Vi<i>s</i>ve devâs, I give this student in charge to you, for the sake of long life, of blessed offspring and strength, of increase of wealth, of mastership of all Vedas, of renown, of bliss.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_131"></a><a href="sbe29033.htm#fr_132">64:1</a> 3. 1. T. Nârâya<i>n</i>a: 'Instead of asau (N.N.) he puts the name of the student in the vocative case.' I think rather that the teacher here pronounced his own name. Comp. asâv aha<i>m</i> bho, chap. 2, 5, &amp;c., and the Mantra in Pâraskara II, 2, 20.</p>  
 <p>The text of the Mantra shows that the Â<i>k</i>ârya here seizes the hand of the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin; comp. Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 20, 4-6, where it is stated that he seizes the student's hand together with the thumb, quite in the way prescribed for the wedding at <i>S</i>âṅkh. I, 13, 2. Comp. also Pâraskara II, 2, 1 7. Nârâya<i>n</i>a: mâ<i>n</i>avakasya g<i>ri</i>hîtasa<i>m</i>pu<i>t</i>a evâ<i>k</i>âryo Bhagas ta ima<i>m</i> mantra<i>m</i> <i>g</i>apan, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_132"></a><a href="sbe29033.htm#fr_133">64:2</a> Literally, 'he turns round, following his right arm.' Nârâya<i>n</i>a here has the following note, 'Â<i>k</i>âryo ba<i>t</i>or dakshi<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> bâhu<i>m</i> hasta<i>m</i> aindrîm âv<i>ri</i>tam iti mantre<i>n</i>ânvâvartayet. ayam artha<i>h</i>, â<i>k</i>ârya ima<i>m</i> mantra<i>m</i> <i>g</i>aptvâ ta<i>m</i> ba<i>t</i>u<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a vâ<i>k</i>ayitvâ pradakshi<i>n</i>âvarta<i>m</i> kârayet.' I believe that the commentator here, as he frequently does, instead of interpreting the text of <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana, fathers <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a> on him statements belonging to other Sûtras, in this case probably to Â<i>s</i>valâyana I, 20, 9. As our text has not anvâvartya but anvâv<i>ri</i>tya; and in the Mantra not âvartasva but âvarte, we must conclude that he turned round himself, and, as far as the statements of the text go, did not cause the pupil to do so.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_133"></a><a href="sbe29033.htm#fr_134">65:5</a> The gesture is the same as that prescribed in the Pâraskara-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 8, 8 to the bridegroom at the wedding; the Mantra there is identical with <i>S</i>âṅkh. II, 4, 1, the only difference consisting in the name of the god who is invoked to unite the two: at the wedding this is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, of course, because he is 'lord of offspring,' at the Upanayana, B<i>ri</i>haspati, the Brahman κατ᾽ εξοχήν among the gods. It is very natural that at the Upanayana and at the Vivâha, which both are destined to establish an intimate union between two persons hitherto strangers to each other, a number of identical rites should occur, for instance, the seizing of the hand; see the note on Sûtra 1.</p>
