 <p>1. Now he should examine the ground in the following ways.</p>  
 <p>2. He should dig a pit knee-deep and fill it again with the same earth (which he has taken out of it).</p>  
 <p>3. If (the earth) reaches out (of the pit, the ground is) excellent; if it is level, (it is) of middle quality; if it does not fill (the pit, it is) to be rejected.</p>  
 <p>4. After sunset he should fill (the pit) with water and leave it so through the night.</p>  
 <p>5. If (in the morning) there is water in it, (the ground is) excellent; if it is moist, (it is) of middle quality; if it is dry, (it is) to be rejected.</p>  
 <p>6. White (ground), of sweet taste, with sand on the surface, (should be elected) by a Brâhma<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>7. Red (ground) for a Kshatriya.</p>  
 <p>8. Yellow (ground) for a Vai<i>s</i>ya.</p>  
 <p>9. He should draw a thousand furrows on it and should have it measured off as quadrangular, with equal sides to each (of the four) directions;</p>  
 <p>10. Or as an oblong quadrangle.</p>

 <p>12. And (so he does again three times) pouring out water without interruption, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Rig-veda X, 9, 1 seqq.).</p>

 <p>14. Into the pits in which the posts are to stand, he should have an Avakâ, i.e. (the water-plant called) <i>S</i>îpâla put down; then fire will not befall him: thus it is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti).</p>  
 <p>15 <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">15</font></a>. Having put (that plant) into the pit in which the middle-post is to stand, he should spread (on it) eastward-pointed and northward-pointed Ku<i>s</i>a grass and should sprinkle (on that grass) water into which rice and barley have been thrown, with (the words), 'To the steady one, the earth-demon, svâhâ!'</p>
