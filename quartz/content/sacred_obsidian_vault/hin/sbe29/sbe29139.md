 <p>special wishes are attained, oblations of) boiled (rice) grains, for the attainment of those wishes, (should be made by the G<i>ri</i>hya sacrificer).</p>  
 <p>2. He attains (thereby) those same wishes.</p>  
 <p>3. For a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, a mess of boiled (rice) grains in six oblations (should he offered)</p>  
 <p>4. With this (hymn), 'I loosen thee by sacrificial food, that thou mayst live' (Rig-veda X, 161).</p>  
 <p>5. If he has seen a bad dream, he should worship the sun with the two verses, 'To-day, god Savit<i>ri</i>' (Rig-veda V, 82, 4, 5), and with the five verses, 'What bad dreams there are among the cows' (Rig-veda VIII, 47, 14 seqq.),</p>  
 <p>6. Or with (the verse), 'Whosoever, O king, be it a companion or a friend' (Rig-veda II, 28, 10).</p>  
 <p>7. When he has sneezed, yawned, seen a disagreeable sight, smelt a bad smell, when his eye palpitates, and when he hears noises in his ears, he should murmur, 'Well-eyed may I become with my eyes, well-vigoured with my face, well-hearing with my ears. May will and insight dwell in me!'</p>

If he has gone to a wife to whom he ought not to go, or if he has performed a sacrifice for a person for whom he ought not to do so, or has eaten forbidden food, or accepted what he ought not to accept, or pushed against a piled-up (fire altar) or</p>

 <p>against a sacrificial post, he should sacrifice two Â<i>g</i>ya oblations with (the verses),</p>  
 <p>'May my faculties return into me, may life return, may prosperity return; may my goods return to me; may the divine power return into me. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'These fires that are stationed on the (altars called) Dhish<i>n</i>yâs, may they be here in good order, each on its right place. (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara, grown strong, the standard of immortality, may he govern my mind in my heart. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>9. Or (he may sacrifice) two pieces of wood,</p>  
 <p>10. Or murmur (the same two verses without any oblation).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_545"></a><a href="sbe29139.htm#fr_546">223:1</a> 6, 1. Nârâya<i>n</i>a divides this Sûtra into two: 1. atha kâmyânâ<i>m</i> sthâne kâmyâ<i>h</i>; 2. <i>k</i>arava<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_546"></a><a href="sbe29139.htm#fr_547">224:8</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a is evidently wrong in explaining <i>k</i>aitya<i>m</i> yûpa<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a by agni<i>k</i>ayanastha<i>m</i> yûpa<i>m</i> (which is not, as Prof. Stenzler takes it, der Opferpfahl auf einem Bestattungsplatze).

 <p>I have translated the second verse in Sûtra 8, as if the text had kalpantâm. The MSS. give kalpatâm. Atharva-veda VII, 67 has kalpayantâm.</p>
