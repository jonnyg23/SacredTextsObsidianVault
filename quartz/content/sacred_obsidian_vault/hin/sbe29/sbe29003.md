 <p><a name="fn_12"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_13">12:1</a> I, 1. The ceremonies to be treated of are defined here as the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as (i.e. oblations of cooked offerings) just as in the opening sentence of the Pâraskara-G<i>ri</i>hya they are called g<i>ri</i>hyasthâlîpâkâs. This is indeed the most characteristic form of offerings belonging to the domain of the G<i>ri</i>hya ritual, though it would not be correct to state that the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras treat exclusively of sacrificial ceremonies of this kind.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_13"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_14">12:2</a> As to the duty of the Vedic student of putting every day a piece of wood on the sacred fire of his teacher, see below, II, 6, 8, and compare the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha-pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a II, 58. According to a Kârikâ given by Nârâya<i>n</i>a, and the Karmapradîpa (I, 6, 13). the prescription of this Sûtra regarding the time for the kindling of the sacred fire refers exclusively to the case of vâgdâna (betrothal). Comp. also Dr. Bloomfield's note on the G<i>ri</i>hya-sa<i>m</i>graha-pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a I, 76 (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XXXV, 560). In the Kârikâ it is stated that if the betrothed girl dies after the fire has been kindled, but before the marriage, the sacrificer is not to forsake his fire, but to marry another girl; if he cannot find a bride, he should make the fire enter into himself according to the rules given by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya V, 1, and himself become uttarâ<i>s</i>ramin, i.e. enter one of the two final Â<i>s</i>ramas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_14"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_15">13:5</a> Nârâya<i>n</i>a: 'If the fire has not been kindled at the time stated above, then, after the householder . . . i.e. the father, even if he should not have performed the âdhâna, or the elder brother has died, the eldest son (or the son who after his elder brother's death has become the eldest), after he has performed the Sapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>îkara<i>n</i>a (for the dead father or brother; see below, IV, 3, and the ninth chapter of the Pari<i>s</i>ish<i>t</i>a [book V]), even if he has not divided the inheritance with his younger brothers (so that the time stated in the fourth Sûtra would not have arrived), should kindle the fire himself, i.e. without an officiating priest (<i>ri</i>tvi<i>g</i>). . . . Or the Sûtra should be divided into two; prete vâ g<i>ri</i>hapatau (or after the death of the householder), and svaya<i>m</i> <i>g</i>yâyân (the eminent one himself), i.e. of Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<i>s</i>yas a <i>g</i>yâyân, which means a most eminent person, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, performs the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as himself; for the two other castes the Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as have to be performed through an officiating priest: this is the meaning of this svaya<i>m</i> (himself).' I have given this note of Nârâya<i>n</i>a as a specimen of the entirely arbitrary and obviously misleading explanations which are unfortunately so frequently found in this author, as indeed in most of the other Sûtra commentators. As to the true meaning of this svaya<i>m</i> I still adhere to the explanation which I proposed in my German edition of the text (p. 118), that in case no division of the inheritance takes place, the sacred fire should be kindled on behalf of all the joint-proprietors, but that only the eldest brother should act personally (svaya<i>m</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_15"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_16">13:8</a> Or, 'at (the fire of) a person rich in cattle, in the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya,' &amp;c.? The commentators (see p. 118 of the German <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a> edition) differ as to whether in purupa<i>s</i>u-vi<i>t</i>kula one or two alternatives are contained, and it is interesting to see that the Sûtra authors themselves differed in this respect; Pâraskara (I, 2, 3), when declaring from what place the fire should be fetched, speaks of the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya rich in cattle; Â<i>s</i>valâyana, on the contrary, who in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra does not expressly treat of the kindling of the domestic fire, in the corresponding passage of the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (II, 2, 1), gives the rule that the dakshi<i>n</i>âgni is to be fetched from the house of a Vai<i>s</i>ya or from a rich person.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_16"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_17">14:9-11</a> 9-11. I now differ from the opinion which I pronounced in my German edition with regard to the relation in which these three Sûtras stand to each other. I think they ought to be understood thus: 9. Some teachers say that the fetching of the fire from its yoni, as taught in Sûtra 8, ought to be done twice; in the evening, so that the fire, after the necessary rites have been performed, goes out, and then again in the morning. 10. But my (the author's) teacher (comp. as to a<i>k</i>âryâ<i>h</i>, Kâtyâyana's <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra I, 3, 7; Professor Garbe's note on Vaitâna-sûtra 1, 3) is of opinion that the fire should be fetched only once, and that with this fire the ceremonies which are taught by the Adhvaryus are to be performed in the evening (see, for instance, Kâty. IV, 7. 8, which passage is paraphrased here by Nârâya<i>n</i>a). 11. In the morning (according to the same teacher, not, as I once understood this passage, according to the eke referred to in Sûtra 9), a full oblation is to be offered, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_17"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_18">14:12</a> <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra II, 6, 2 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_18"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_19">15:13</a> <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra I, 1, 6. 7: ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>opavîtî devakarmâ<i>n</i>i karoti, prâ<i>k</i>înâvîtî pitryâ<i>n</i>i, &amp;c. The unity of the ritual of course means the unity of the two great domains of the <i>S</i>rauta and G<i>ri</i>hya ritual.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_19"></a><a href="sbe29003.htm#fr_20">15:15</a> With regard to the twenty-one kinds of sacrifice compare, for instance, Gautama VIII, 18-20; Max Müller, Z<i>D</i><i>M</i><i>G</i>. IX, p. lxxiii; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 326. The seven kinds of Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as are the Ash<i>t</i>akâ sacrifices (see below, III, 12 seq.), the sacrifices offered at each Parvan (I, 3), the <i>S</i>râddha (or funeral) sacrifices (IV, 1 seq.), the sacrifice of the <i>S</i>râva<i>n</i>î full moon (IV, 19), of the Âgrahâya<i>n</i>î (IV, 17 seq.), of the <i>K</i>aitrî (IV, 19), and of the Â<i>s</i>vayu<i>g</i>î (IV, 16). The seven Havis sacrifices (belonging, as is the case also with the third division of sacrifices, to the <i>S</i>rauta ritual) are the Agnyâdheya, the Agnihotra, the sacrifices of the full and new moon, the Âgraya<i>n</i>a, the three <i>K</i>âturmâsya sacrifices, the Nirû<i>dh</i>apa<i>s</i>ubandha, and the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î. The seven kinds of Soma sacrifices (of which the more ancient texts mention only three or four sa<i>m</i>sthâs, see Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 1 20) are the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, the Atyagnish<i>t</i>oma, the Ukthya, the Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in, the Atirâtra, the Aptoryâma.</p>
