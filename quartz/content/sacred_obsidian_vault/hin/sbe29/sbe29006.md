 <p><a name="fn_30"></a><a href="sbe29006.htm#fr_31">19:1</a> 4, 1. The Paddhati of Râma<i>k</i>andra understands svâdhyâyam adhîyîta as a prescription to perform the daily Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a (comp., for instance, Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya III, 2; Âpastamba I, 11, 22 seq.), which consists in the recitation of portions of the Veda; the hymns and verses stated in Sûtra 2 are, according to the same authority, to be repeated immediately after the recitation of the svâdhyâya ('svâdhyâyânantaram'). Nârâya<i>n</i>a, on the contrary, considers that the svâdhyâya prescribed in Sûtra 1 consists of those very hymns and verses which are indicated in the second Sûtra. As to the Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, he says that the <i>k</i>a at the end of the second Sûtra may be referred to it ('the word <i>k</i>a means that texts procuring a long life, such as Rig-veda I, 89, should be murmured, or an injunction of the Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a is intended'). At all events it is very difficult to believe that the recitation of the texts stated in this chapter should be quite independent from the daily Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a. About the performance of the Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a in our days comp. the note of Professor Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. 43.</p>
