 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)</i>, by Hermann Oldenberg, [1886], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A 16.</h3>  
 <p>1 <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a>. 'A bull's hide'this has been declared.</p>  
 <p>2 <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">2</font></a>. On that hide the husband makes her sit down and sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, four oblations (with the following formulas),</p>  
 <p>3. 'With god Agni, with the earth-world of the worlds, and the Rig-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'With god Vâyu, with the air-world of the worlds,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>with the Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'With god Sûrya, with the heaven-world of the worlds, with the Sâma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'With god <i>K</i>andra, with the world of the quarters (of the horizon) of the worlds, with the Brahma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>4. Or, 'Bhû<i>h</i>! What harm dwells in thee, bringing death to thy husband, death to thy husband's brother, that I make death-bringing to thy paramour, N.N., svâhâ!'thus the first (of the before-mentioned formulas) may be joined with the first Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>ti, the second with the second, the third with the third, the fourth with (the three Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis) together.</p>  
 <p>5. With (the verse), 'With no evil eye' (Rig-veda X, 85, 44), let him besmear (her) eyes with Â<i>g</i>ya salve.</p>  
 <p>6. (The bridegroom,) having touched the ends of her hair with the three (verses), 'How may us the resplendent one . . .' (Rig-veda IV, 31, 1-3),</p>  
 <p>7. And having quickly recited the four verses, 'And those divine medicines' (Rig-veda VIII, 18, 8), at the end (of that text) with the word svâhâ (pours out) the remainder on (her) head.</p>  
 <p>8 <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">8</font></a>. Here some place a boy of good birth on both sides, in her lap, with this (verse), 'Into thy womb' (see below, chap. 19, 6),</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. Or also silently.</p>  
 <p>10. Into this (boy's) joined hands (the bridegroom) gives fruits and causes (the Brâhma<i>n</i>as) to wish an auspicious day.</p>  
 <p>11. Thus she becomes the mother of male children.</p>  
 <p>12. With the rest of the hymn, 'Stay ye here both' (Rig-veda X, 85, 42 seq.), they make them enter the house.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_90"></a><a href="sbe29018.htm#fr_91">41:1</a> 16, 1. In chap. 15, 22 it is said that the bride arrives at the house; in 16, 12, that she enters the house. Probably we are to understand, therefore, that the sacrifice prescribed in this chapter, Sûtras 2 seq., is performed before the house, like the Vâstoshpatîya karman (below, III, 4). The words, 'has been declared,' refer to the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra (IV, r6, 2), 'Having spread a red bull's skin, with the neck to the north or to the east, with the hair outside, behind the fire, they sit down,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_91"></a><a href="sbe29018.htm#fr_92">41:2</a> On anvârambha comp. the quotation in the note on chap. II, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_92"></a><a href="sbe29018.htm#fr_93">42:8</a> It should be noted that the verse â te yonim is quoted here only with the Pratika, while its full text is given below, chap. 19, 6. Can the Sûtras describing this ceremony with the kumâra ubhayata<i>h</i>-su<i>g</i>âta be a later addition?</p>
