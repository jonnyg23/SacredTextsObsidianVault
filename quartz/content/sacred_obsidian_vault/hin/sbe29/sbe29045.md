Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra and in the Sûtras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_193"></a><a href="sbe29045.htm#fr_194">87:1</a> 15, 1. This Sûtra presupposes the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IV, 21, 1: 'To six persons the Argha reception is due, viz. to the teacher, to an officiating priest, to the father-in-law, to a king, to a Snâtaka, to a friend.' Here the fourth person mentioned is the <i>s</i>va<i>s</i>ura, while in the G<i>ri</i>hya text the expression vaivâhya is used. It is difficult not to believe that both words are used in the same sense, and accordingly Nârâya<i>n</i>a says vivâhya<i>h</i> <i>s</i>va<i>s</i>ura<i>h</i>. Comp. Professor Stenzler's note on Pâraskara I, 3, 1; Âpastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama V, 27.</p>  
 <p>Sâmânyatama<i>m</i> sad<i>ri</i><i>s</i>atama<i>m</i> mâshâdikam (mâkhâdikam the MS.) annam. Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_194"></a><a href="sbe29045.htm#fr_195">87:2-3</a> 2, 3. These Sûtras are identical with Pâraskara I, 3, 29. 30. The following Sûtra of Pâraskara stands in the <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana text as <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a> Sûtra 10. Probably Pâraskara here represents the text which both Sûtrakâras follow, more exactly, and the enumeration given by <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana in Sûtras 4-9 of the different categories of Arghyas with the corresponding deities, is an addition to that original stock of rules.</p>  
 <p>Apparently the two Sûtras 2 and 3 stand in contradiction to each other, as Sûtra 2 seems to prescribe that at the Argha meal in every case flesh should be given to the guest, and Sûtra 3 specifies only two occasions on which the killing of the Argha cow cannot be dispensed with. Perhaps the meaning is this, that it is not necessary, except in the cases of a sacrifice and of a wedding, to kill a cow expressly for that purpose, but that in any case, even if the cow offered to the guest be declined by him, the host should take care that some flesh be served at that meal. So says Nârâya<i>n</i>a in his note on Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 24, 33, 'Pa<i>s</i>ukara<i>n</i>apakshe tanmâ<i>m</i>sena bho<i>g</i>anam, utsar<i>g</i>anapakshe mâ<i>m</i>santare<i>n</i>a.' Similarly the Buddhists distinguish between eating flesh and eating the flesh of an animal expressly killed in order to entertain that very guest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_195"></a><a href="sbe29045.htm#fr_196">88:6</a> The literal translation of vaivâhya would be 'a person related by marriage.' But comp. the note on Sûtra 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_196"></a><a href="sbe29045.htm#fr_197">88:8</a> Priya of course does not mean <i>g</i>âmâtar, as is stated in a number of commentaries. Gobhila says, priyo<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>tithi<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_197"></a><a href="sbe29045.htm#fr_198">88:11</a> Other persons, for instance a king, can claim the Argha reception not more than once a year. Comp. Âpastamba II, 8, 7; Gautama V, 28, 29, &amp;c.</p>
