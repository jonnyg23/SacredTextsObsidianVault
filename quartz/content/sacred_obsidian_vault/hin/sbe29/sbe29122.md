 <p>1 <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He chooses priests (for officiating at a sacrifice) with neither deficient nor superfluous limbs, 'who on</p>

 <p>the mother's and on the father's side (&amp;c.),' as it has been said above.</p>  
 <p>2. Let him choose young men as officiating priests: thus (declare) some (teachers).</p>  
 <p>3. He chooses first the Brahman, then the Hot<i>ri</i>, then the Adhvaryu, then the Udgât<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p>4 <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Or all who officiate at the Ahîna sacrifices and at those lasting one day.</p>  
 <p>5 <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">5</font></a>. The Kaushîtakinas prescribe the Sadasya as the seventeenth, saying, 'He is the looker-on at the performances.'</p>  
 <p>6 <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">6</font></a>. This has been said in the two <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as, 'He whom the officiating priests, performing (the sacrifice) in many ways' (Rig-veda VIII, 58, I. 2).</p>  
 <p>7 <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">7</font></a>. He chooses the Hot<i>ri</i> first.</p>  
 <p>8. With (the formula), 'Agni is my Hot<i>ri</i>; he is my Hot<i>ri</i>; I choose thee N.N. as my Hot<i>ri</i>' (he chooses) the Hot<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. With (the formula), '<i>K</i>andramas (the moon) is my Brahman; he is my Brahman; I choose thee N.N. as my Brahman' (he chooses) the Brahman.</p>  
 <p>10. With (the formula), 'Âditya (the sun) is my Adhvaryu; (he is my Adhvaryu, &amp;c.)'the Adhvaryu.</p>  
 <p>11. With (the formula), 'Par<i>g</i>anya is my Udgât<i>ri</i>; (he is my Udgât<i>ri</i>, &amp;c.)'the Udgât<i>ri</i>.</p>  
 <p>12 <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">12</font></a>. With (the formula), 'The waters are my reciters of what belongs to the Hotrakas'the Hotrakas.</p>  
 <p>13 <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">13-14</font></a>. With (the formula), 'The rays are my <i>K</i>amasâdhvaryus'the <i>K</i>amasâdhvaryus.</p>  
 <p>14. With (the formula), 'The ether is my Sadasya'the Sadasya.</p>  
 <p>15. He whom he has chosen should murmur, 'A great thing thou hast told me; splendour thou hast told me; fortune thou hast told me; glory thou hast told me; praise thou hast told me; success thou hast told me; enjoyment thou hast told me; satiating thou hast told me; everything thou hast told me.'</p>  
 <p>16. Having murmured (this formula), the Hot<i>ri</i> declares his assent (in the words), 'Agni is thy Hot<i>ri</i>; he is thy Hot<i>ri</i>; thy human Hot<i>ri</i> am I.'</p>  
 <p>17. '<i>K</i>andramas (the moon) is thy Brahman; he is thy Brahman (&amp;c.)'thus the Brahman.</p>  
 <p>18. In the same way the others according to the prescriptions (given above).</p>  
 <p>19 <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">19</font></a>. And if (the priest who accepts the invitation)</p>

 <p>is going to perform the sacrifice (for the inviting person, he should add), 'May that bless me; may that enter upon me; may I thereby enjoy (bliss).'</p>  
 <p>20 <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">20</font></a>. The functions of an officiating priest are not to be exercised, if abandoned (by another priest), or at an Ahîna sacrifice with small sacrificial fee, or for a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, or decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for such persons (the functions of a Ritvi<i>g</i> should not be exercised).</p>  
 <p>21 <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">21</font></a>. He (who is chosen as a <i>Ri</i>tvi<i>g</i>) should ask the Somapravâka, 'What sacrifice is it? Who are</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>the priests officiating? What is the fee for the sacrifice?'</p>  
 <p>22. If (all the conditions) are favourable, he should accept.</p>  
 <p>23. Let (the officiating priests) eat no flesh nor have intercourse with a wife until the completion of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p>24. 'By this prayer, O Agni, increase' (Rig-veda I, 31, 18)with (this verse) let him offer (at the end of the sacrifice) an oblation of Â<i>g</i>ya in (his own) Dakshi<i>n</i>âgni, and go away where he likes;</p>  
 <p>25. In the same way one who has not set up the (<i>S</i>rauta) fires, in his (sacred) domestic fire with this <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>, 'Forgive us, O Agni, this sin' (Rig-veda I, 31, 16).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_470"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_471">193:1</a> 23, 1. Comp. <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IX, 3, 20; G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra I, 5, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_471"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_472">194:4</a> The Ahîna sacrifices are those which last more than one day, but not more than twelve days. (Indische Studien, IX, 373; X, 355.) The priests officiating at such sacrifices are the sixteen stated in the <i>S</i>rauta-sûtra IV, 1, 6. 7. Those besides the sixteen, though they are chosen (saty api vara<i>n</i>e) for taking part in the sacred performances, have not the rank of <i>ri</i>tvi<i>g</i>as (officiating priests); such are the Sadasya, the Samit<i>ri</i>, and the <i>K</i>amasâdhvaryava<i>h</i> (schol. <i>S</i>rautas. loc. cit.). See Max Müller's History of A. S. L., pp. 450, 469 seq. As to the Sadasya, however, there was some difference of opinion (see the next Sûtra).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_472"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_473">194:5</a> On the office of the Sadasya, see Indische Studien, X, 136, 144.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_473"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_474">194:6</a> The two <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as quoted here belong to the tenth among the Vâlakhilya hymns, a hymn omitted in many of the Rig-veda MSS. They give no special confirmation to the rules stated in our text, but contain only a general allusion to the unity of the sacrifice, which the various priests perform in many various ways.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_474"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_475">194:7</a> 'If the four (chief) priests have to be chosen, the choosing of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a stands first in order (see above, Sûtra 3); if all (the sixteen), then the choosing of the Hot<i>ri</i> stands first in order.' Nârâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_475"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_476">195:12</a> The twelve priests of the sixteen (see § 4 note) who do not stand at the head of one of the four categories. Those at the head are enumerated in the Sutras</p>
 <p><a name="fn_476"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_477">195:13-14</a> 13, 14. See above, § 4 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_477"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_478">195:19</a> Priests who only perform the Agnyâdheya for a person, are, according to Nârâya<i>n</i>a's note on this Sûtra, not considered as <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a> performing a sacrifice for him; consequently the formula given here is only to be used by priests who are elected for a Soma sacrifice. Stenzler translates, 'So spricht er, wenn er das Opfer durch sie vollziehen lassen will.' But this would be yakshyamâ<i>n</i>a<i>h</i>, not yâ<i>g</i>ayishyan.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_478"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_479">196:20</a> The tradition takes nî<i>k</i>adakshi<i>n</i>asya as in apposition to ahînasya, and I have translated accordingly. But I cannot help thinking that the two words should be separated, so that we should have to translate, 'or at an Ahîna, or for a person that gives small sacrificial fee.' Thus the Brâhma<i>n</i>a quoted by Âpastamba (see the commentary on the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, vol. i, p. 6, ed. Bibl. Indica) gives the following questions which the Ritvi<i>g</i> to be chosen should ask, 'Is it no Ahîna sacrifice? Is the Ritvi<i>g</i> office not abandoned by others? Is the sacrificial fee plentiful?' It is a very singular fact, that on the one hand the assistance of a number of <i>Ri</i>tvi<i>g</i>as was unanimously declared necessary for the performance of an Ahîna sacrifice, while on the other hand it was considered objectionable, at least among some of the Vedic schools, to officiate at such a sacrifice. See Weber's Indische Studien, X, 150, 151.</p>  
 <p>On anude<i>s</i>yabhi<i>s</i>asta Nârâya<i>n</i>a says, sade<i>s</i>inâbhi<i>s</i>astasyaivam eke. anye tu <i>s</i>râddhe pratishiddhasyety âhu<i>h</i>. It seems to me that anude<i>s</i>ya (or rather ânude<i>s</i>ya?) in <i>S</i>âṅkhâyana-<i>S</i>raut. V, 1, 10 (Indische Studien, X, 147) means the same, though the commentary on that Sûtra ascribes a different meaning to that word.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_479"></a><a href="sbe29122.htm#fr_480">196:21</a> The Somapravâka is the messenger who invites the priests on behalf of the sacrificer to officiate at his intended Soma sacrifice. Comp. Indische Studien, IX, 308.</p>
