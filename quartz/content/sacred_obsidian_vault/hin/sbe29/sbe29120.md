 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)</i>, by Hermann Oldenberg, [1886], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">KA<i>N</i><i>D</i>IKÂ 21.</h3>  
 <p>1. Some (do this) with a Mantra: 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great <i>G</i>âtavedas. Through that piece of wood increase thou, O Agni; through the Brahman (may) we (increase). Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>2. Having put the fuel (on the fire) and having</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>touched the fire, he three times wipes off his face with (the words), 'With splendour I anoint myself.'</p>  
 <p>3. 'For with splendour does he anoint himself'this is understood (in the <i>S</i>ruti).</p>  
 <p>4. 'On me may Agni bestow insight, on me offspring, on me splendour.</p>  
 <p>'On me may Indra bestow insight, on me offspring, on me strength (indriya).</p>  
 <p>'On me may Sûrya bestow insight, on me offspring, on me radiance.</p>  
 <p>'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby become resplendent.</p>  
 <p>'What thy vigour is, Agni, may I thereby become vigorous.</p>  
 <p>'What thy consuming power is, Agni, may I thereby obtain consuming power'with (these formulas) he should approach the fire, bend his knee, embrace (the teacher's feet), and say to him, 'Recite, sir! The Sâvitrî, sir, recite!'</p>  
 <p>5. Seizing with his (i.e. the student's) garment and with (his own) hands (the student's) hands (the teacher) recites the Sâvitrî, (firstly) Pâda by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) the whole (verse).</p>  
 <p>6. He should make him recite (the Sâvitrî) as far as he is able.</p>  
 <p>7. On the place of his (i.e. the student's) heart (the teacher) lays his hand with the fingers upwards, with (the formula), 'Into my will I take thy heart; after my mind shall thy mind follow; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy will; may B<i>ri</i>haspati join thee to me.'</p>
