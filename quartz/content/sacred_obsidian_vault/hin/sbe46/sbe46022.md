 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">MA<i>N</i><i>D</i>ALA I, HYMN 72.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ASH<i>T</i>AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 17–18.</h4>  
 <p>1. He has brought down (i. e. surpassed) the wisdom of many a worshipper <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:1:1">1</a>, he who holds in his hand all manly power. Agni has become the lord of treasures, he who brought together all (powers of) immortality.</p>  
 <p>2 <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:1">1</a>. All the clever immortals when seeking did not find the calf though sojourning round about us. The attentive (gods), wearying themselves, following his footsteps <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:2">2</a>, stood at the highest, beautiful <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:3">3</a> standing-place of Agni.</p>  
 <p>3. When the bright ones <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:1">1</a> had done service <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:2">2</a> to thee, the bright one, Agni, with Gh<i>ri</i>ta through three autumns, they assumed worshipful names; the well-born shaped their own bodies.</p>  
 <p>4. Acquiring (or, exploring?) for themselves the two great worlds, the worshipful ones brought forward their Rudra-like powers <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:1">1</a>. The mortal, when (beings) were in discord <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:2">2</a>, perceived and found out Agni standing in the highest place.</p>  
 <p>5. Being like-minded they <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:1">1</a> reverentially approached him on their knees. Together with their wives they venerated the venerable one <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:2">2</a>. Abandoning their bodies they made them their own <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:3">3</a>, the (one) friend waking when the (other) friend closed his eyes <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:4">4</a>.</p>  
 <p>6. When the worshipful (gods) have discovered the thrice seven secret steps <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:1">1</a> (or, places) laid down in thee, they concordantly guard with them immortality.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Protect thou the cattle and that which remains steadfast <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:2">2</a> and that which moves.</p>  
 <p>7. Knowing, O Agni, the established orders <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:1">1</a> of (human) dwellings, distribute in due order gifts <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:2">2</a> that they may live. Knowing the ways which the gods go <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:3">3</a>, thou hast become the unwearied messenger, the bearer of oblations.</p>  
 <p>8. They who knew the right way and were filled with good intentions, beheld from heaven the seven young <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:1">1</a> (rivers) and the doors of riches. Saramâ found the strong stable of the cows from which human clans receive their nourishment <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>9. The Earth has spread herself far and wide with them who are great in their greatness, the mother Aditi, for the refreshment of the bird <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:1">1</a>, with her sons who have assumed all powers of their own dominion <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:2">2</a>, preparing (for themselves) the way to immortality.</p>  
 <p>10. When the immortals created the two eyes of heaven <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:1">1</a>, they placed fair splendour in him (Agni) <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:2">2</a>. Then they rush down <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:3">3</a> like streams let loose. The red ones have recognised, O Agni, those which are directed downwards <a href="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:4">4</a>.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi and metre.—Verse 1 = TS. II, 2, 12, 1. Verse 3 = TB. II, 4, 5, 6. Verses 8–9 = TB. II, 5, 8, 10.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:1:1">1</a>. The meaning seems to me to be: by his wisdom he excels all human wisdom. Prof. Max Müller translates: 'Agni, who holds in his hand all that men desire, conquers</p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (or, wins for himself) the praises of many a wise worshipper.' And the last Pâda: 'he who brought together all immortal blessings.'—On <i>s</i>a<i>s</i>vat, see VI, 61, 1; VII, 18, 18; VIII, 23, 28.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:2:1">1</a>. Here we have again the myth of the hidden Agni whom the gods seek. Agni is meant by the calf.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:2:2">2</a>. Going on foot, Sâya<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:2:3">3</a>. I follow Sâya<i>n</i>a, Bollensen, and Ludwig in taking <i>k</i>â´ru as a locative.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:3:1">1</a>. 'Was not Sâya<i>n</i>a right in taking this verse as referring to the Maruts? Cf. VI, 48, 21.… su<i>g</i>âta also is an epithet of the Maruts, I, 88, 3; 166, 12.' M. M.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:3:2">2</a>. As to the subjunctive, comp. Delbrück, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, p. 67. The Taittirîya Brâhma<i>n</i>a (II, 4, 5, 6) reads saparyán.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:4:1">1</a>. I follow the Padapâ<i>th</i>a which has rudríyâ. But possibly we may have the nom. plur. rudríyâ<i>h</i>: 'the worshipful Rudriyas (i. e. Maruts) rushed forward.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:4:2">2</a>. The translation of nemádhitâ is in jeopardy.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:5:1">1</a>. Probably the mortals, as Ludwig understands it. Comp. márta<i>h</i>, verse 4.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:5:2">2</a>. The venerable one is Agni.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:5:3">3</a>. Possibly the text is corrupt. In IV, 24, 3 we read ririkvâ´<i>m</i>sa<i>h</i> tanṽa<i>h</i> k<i>ri</i><i>n</i>vata trâ´m, 'abandoning (i. e. risking) their bodies they took him (Indra) for their protector' (comp. I, 100, 7). Should svâ´<i>h</i> have supplanted another word, for instance, trâ´m? As the pronoun svá very frequently stands in apposition with tanû´, it may have found its way also into passages to which it did not belong.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:5:4">4</a>. The meaning seems to be that whenever the attention of one of the friends relaxed, another friend watched instead of the first. See Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLIV, 328; Bartholomae, Studien zur indogerm. Sprachgeschichte, I, 95.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:6:1">1</a>. Sâya<i>n</i>a explains the trí<i>h</i> saptá padâ´ as the three times seven kinds of sacrifices, the seven Pâkaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as, the seven Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as, the seven Somaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>as. But this later system of the twenty-one forms of sacrifice can scarcely have existed at the time of the Rig-veda Sa<i>m</i>hitâ. Three times seven is a favourite number in Rig-vedic mysticism; comp. I, 191, 12. 14; IV, 1, 16; VII, 87, 4; VIII, 46, 26; 69, 7; 96, 2; IX, 70, 1; 86, 21; X, 64, 8; 90, 15: Possibly three times seven pieces of wood (samídha<i>h</i>) are alluded to, comp. X, 90, 15, but everybody who has studied Bergaigne's Arithmétique mythologique (Rel. Véd. II, 114 seq.; see especially p. 122) will admit that there are ever so many possible interpretations of a passage like this. Prof. Max Müller's translation is: 'The worshipful gods found in thee the twenty-one words which are hidden in thee. They guard with them the immortal (Agni).'—Instead of avidan (Padapâ<i>th</i>a) I think we must read ávidan.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:6:2">2</a>. Ludwig certainly is wrong in translating 'hüte du den wandel von tier and pflanze.' The author of this group of hymns is very fond of the phrase sthâtú<i>h</i> <i>k</i>arátham and the like; see I, 68, 1; 70, 3. 7. Tire same phrase, in one or the other of its possible shapes, has evidently been used by him here also. The plural masculine sthât<i>rî´</i><i>n</i> is indeed very strange. Possibly J. Wackernagel is right in reading sthât<i>rî´</i>n (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 287; comp. Lanman, p. 422); the reading sthât<i>rî´</i><i>n</i> may be due to the neighbourhood of pa<i>s</i>û´n. This sort of blunder is very frequent in the text of the Rig-veda. Prof. Max Müller suggests: the stabled cattle and what moves about (in the meadows).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:7:1">1</a>. On vayúna, comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 295. 300. 'The thoughts of human beings.' M. M.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:7:2">2</a>. <i>S</i>urúdh: Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 32. 50.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:7:3">3</a>. 'Which lead to the gods?' M. M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:8:1">1</a>. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.—'Beheld the seven young rivers coming down from heaven.' M. M.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:8:2">2</a>. See Delbrück, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, 87.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:9:1">1</a>. The bird seems to be Agni.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:9:2">2</a>. The Padapâ<i>th</i>a gives su-apatyâ´ni. There is no doubt a word su-apatyá, 'blessed with good offspring.' This is frequently used together with such nouns as rayi, kshaya, ish; it stands in several passages by the side of pra<i>g</i>âvat. See I, 117, 19; II, 2, 12; 4, 8; 9, 5; III, 3, 7; 16, 1; IV, 2, 11; X, 30, 12. But from this word should be distinguished sva-patyá, derived from svá-pati (X, 44, 1, &amp;c.), 'a man's own dominion,' or 'own rulership;' comp. <i>g</i>âspatyá. This word is found here, and in some other passages, for instance, VII, 91, 3. ví<i>s</i>vâ ít nára<i>h</i> svapatyâ´ni <i>k</i>akru<i>h</i>, 'the heroes have exercised all the powers of their own dominion;' VIII, 15, 10. satrâ´ ví<i>s</i>vâ svapatyâ´ni dadhishe, 'thou hast assumed (Indra) all powers of thy own dominion altogether.'—Ludwig translates correctly, 'alle selbstherlichkeit.'</p>  
 <p>The Taittirîya Brâhma<i>n</i>a reads <i>k</i>akrú<i>h</i> for tasthú<i>h</i>. This reading evidently rests on Rig-veda IV, 34, 9; VII, 91, 3. There is no reason, however, for preferring this to the traditional reading of our Rik-text.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:10:1">1</a>. The sun and the moon? This very natural explanation will scarcely be modified on account of passages like the following (<i>S</i>atapatha Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 6, 3, 38):</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'These are the two eyes of the sacrifice, the (oblations of butter called) Â<i>g</i>yabhâgas.'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:10:2">2</a>. Comp. below, 73, 4.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:10:3">3</a>. It is not necessary to change the text; I believe, however, that the conjecture adhá<i>h</i> ksharanti (they stream downwards) would not be quite improbable. Comp. my Prolegomena, p. 369, note 1.—The subject seems to be the streams of sacrificial libations.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:72:10:4">4</a>. Both expressions, 'the red ones' and 'those which are directed downwards,' are feminine. The red ones may be the dawns. But these cannot be called 'directed downwards.' I take, therefore, the one noun as a nominative, the other as an accusative. Cannot 'those which are directed downwards' be the libations of Gh<i>ri</i>ta and the like, which the dawns see?—Prof. Max Müller translates: 'People recognised the red netherward mares (of thee), O Agni.' He supplies <i>g</i>vâlâ<i>h</i> or takes arushî<i>h</i> as mares, cf. V, 56, 6.</p>
