 <p>1. The Hot<i>ri</i> who is found on the Hot<i>ri</i>'s seat has sat down (there), the fierce, the resplendent, the dexterous one, the protector of (his own) infallible laws <a href="sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:1:1">1</a>, the highest Vasu, he who brings thousandfold (gain), the pure-tongued Agni.</p>  
 <p>2. Be thou our messenger, be our protector far and wide; be thou, O bull, a leader towards greater wealth. O Agni! for the continuation of our children and of ourselves be thou an unremitting, brilliant protector.</p>  
 <p>3. May we worship thee at thy highest birth (-place), O Agni; may we worship thee with praises in thy lower abode. I honour the womb from which thou hast sprung. When thou hast been kindled, they have offered offerings in thee.</p>  
 <p>4. Agni, being the best sacrificer perform thou the sacrifice with the oblation. With thy readiness to hear (us) hail our gift, the wealth (which we offer). For thou art the treasure-lord of treasures; thou art the deviser of brilliant speech.</p>  
 <p>5. Thy wealth of both kinds <a href="sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:5:1">1</a> never fails, when thou art born (kindled) day by day, "O wonderful one. Make thy singer, O Agni, rich in food; make him the lord of wealth with excellent offspring.</p>  
 <p>6. With this face of thine, as a bounteous (lord), a sacrificer to the gods, the best performer of sacrifices with happiness, as an undeceivable guardian and far-reaching protector, shine among us, O Agni, with light and wealth.</p>

 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi. Metre, Trish<i>t</i>ubh.—According to an observation of Bergaigne's, hymns of six verses composed in Trish<i>t</i>ubh should precede hymns of the same extent composed in Gâyatrî. Though this law is not without exceptions (see H. O., Die Hymnen des Rigveda, I, 202 seq.), the suspicion is raised that the hymns 9 and 10 should each be divided into two T<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as.—Verse 1 = VS. XI, 36; TS. III, 3, 11, 2; IV, 1, 3, 3; MS. II, 7, 3. Verse 2 = TS. III, 5, 11, 2; MS. IV, 10, 4. Verse 3 = VS. XVII, 75; TS. IV, 6, 5, 4; MS. II, 10, 6. Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 2; MS. IV, 10, 5.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:9:1:1">1</a>. The long compound looks suspicious; possibly it should be read ádabdhavrata<i>h</i> prámati<i>h</i>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_2:9:5:1">1</a>. Vásu and dhána frequently receive the epithet ubhâya; see VI, 19, 10; VII, 82, 4; 83, 5; X, 84, 7. No doubt celestial and terrestrial goods are referred to, see II, 14, 11; V, 68, 3; VI, 59, 9; VII, 97, 10; IX, 19, 1; 100, 3.</p>
