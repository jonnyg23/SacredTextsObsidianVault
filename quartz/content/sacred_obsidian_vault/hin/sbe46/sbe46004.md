 <p>1. We choose Agni as our messenger, the all-possessor, as the Hot<i>ri</i> of this sacrifice, the highly wise.</p>  
 <p>2. Agni and Agni again they constantly invoked with their invocations, the lord of the clans, the bearer of oblations, the beloved of many.</p>  
 <p>3. Agni, when born, conduct the gods hither for him who has strewn the Barhis (sacrificial grass) <a href="sbe46004.htm#an_1:12:3:1">1</a>; thou art our Hot<i>ri</i>, worthy of being magnified <a href="sbe46004.htm#an_1:12:3:2">2</a>.</p>  
 <p>4. Awaken them, the willing ones, when thou goest as messenger, O Agni. Sit down with the gods on the Barhis.</p>  
 <p>5. O thou to whom Gh<i>ri</i>ta oblations are poured out, resplendent (god), burn against the mischievous, O Agni, against the sorcerers.</p>  
 <p>6. By Agni Agni is kindled (or, by fire fire is kindled), the sage, the master of the house, the young one, the bearer of oblations, whose mouth is the sacrificial spoon.</p>  
 <p>7. Praise Agni the sage, whose ordinances for the sacrifice are true, the god who drives away sickness.</p>  
 <p>8. Be the protector, O Agni, of a master of sacrificial food who worships thee, O god, as his messenger.</p>  
 <p>9. Be merciful, O purifier, unto the man who is rich in sacrificial food, and who invites Agni to the feast of the gods.</p>  
 <p>10. Thus, O Agni, resplendent purifier, conduct</p>  
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>the gods hither to us, to our sacrifice and to our food.</p>  
 <p>11. Thus praised by us with our new Gâyatra hymn, bring us wealth of valiant men and food.</p>  
 <p>12. Agni with thy bright splendour be pleased, through all our invocations of the gods, with this our praise.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>This hymn is ascribed to Medhâtithi Kâ<i>n</i>va. It is the opening hymn of a collection which extends from I, 12 to 23 (not, as Ludwig, III, 102, believes, from I, 2 to 17; see my Prolegomena, p. 220). That the authorship of this collection belongs indeed to the Ka<i>n</i>va family, whose poetical compositions are found partly in the first and partly in the eighth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala, is shown by the text of 14, 2–5, and by other evidence; see Zeitschr. der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XXXVIII, 448.</p>  
 <p>The metre is Gâyatrî. It is possible, though I do not think it probable, that the hymn should be considered as consisting of T<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as. Verse 1 = SV. I, 3; TS. II, 5, 8, 5; V, 5, 6, 1; TB. III, 5, 2, 3; MS. IV, 10, 2. Verses 1–3= SV. II, 140–142; AV. XX, 101, 1–3. Verse 2 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 8; MS. IV, 10, 1. Verse 3 = TB. III, II, 6, 2. Verses 6, 8, 9 = SV. II, 194–196. Verse 6 = TS. I, 4, 46, 3; III, 5, 11, 5; V, 5, 6, 1; TB. II, 7, 12, 3; MS. IV, 10, 2 (3). Verse 7 = SV. I, 32. Verse 10 = VS. XVII, 9; TS. I, 3, 14, 8; 5, 5, 3; IV, 6, 1, 3; MS. I, 5, 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>
