 <p>1. When Mâtari<i>s</i>van … <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:1">1</a> had produced by attrition the Hot<i>ri</i>, the … <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:2">2</a> who belongs to all gods, whom they have established among the human clans, shining like the sun, resplendent that (he might show his beautiful) shape—</p>  
 <p>2. They did not deceive him <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:1">1</a> who had granted a hymn (to the worshipper). Agni is my protection; therewith he is satisfied. They took pleasure in all his <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:2">2</a> works—(in the works) of the singer who brought praise.</p>  
 <p>3. Whom the worshipful (gods) <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:1">1</a> took and placed in his own seat (as priest) with their praises: him they <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:2">2</a> have carried forward, taking hold of him in their search, hastening like horses that draw a chariot.</p>  
 <p>4. The marvellous one destroys many things with his jaws. Then <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:4:1">1</a> the resplendent one shines in the forest. Then the wind blows after his flame day by day as after the arrow of an archer, after a weapon that has been shot.</p>  
 <p>5. Him whom no impostors, no harmful foes <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:1">1</a>, no harm-doers may harm when he dwells in (his mother's) womb, him the blind ones bereft of sight did not damage by looking at him <a href="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:2">2</a>. His own friends have protected him.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
 <p>The same <i>Ri</i>shi and metre.—Verse 1 = MS. IV, 14, 15.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:1:1">1</a>. The first Pâda is identical with the first Pâda of I, 71, 4 (see our note there) with the exception of the word vish<i>t</i>á<i>h</i>, instead of which that parallel passage has the reading ví-bh<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i>. It seems impossible to explain vish<i>t</i>á<i>h</i>, and the concurrence of the metrical irregularity in the same part of the Pâda—though metrical irregularities are not infrequent in this hymn—invites to a correction of the text. If ví-bh<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> in I, 71, 4 (see note there) refers to Mâtari<i>s</i>van, which I consider as doubtful, it would be easy to find for our passage an equivalent of that word little differing from the traditional vish<i>t</i>á<i>h</i>, namely, vísthita<i>h</i>: 'when Mâtari<i>s</i>van, standing in different places, had produced him by attrition.' Of course whoever adopts a conjecture like this, can scarcely avoid understanding ví-bh<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i> in I, 71, 4 as an epithet of Mâtari<i>s</i>van, not of Agni. Another way to correct our passage would be to put into the text a form derived from the root vish, 'to accomplish a work,' for instance, vish<i>t</i>yâ´ (to be read as trisyllabic): 'when Mâtari<i>s</i>van by his effort,' &amp;c. Grassmann's ví-sita<i>h</i> is quite improbable.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:1:2">2</a>. Vi<i>s</i>vá-apsum (Sa<i>m</i>hitâ text, vi<i>s</i>vâ´psum), evidently an epithet of Agni the Hot<i>ri</i>, seems corrupt. Shall we read vi<i>s</i>vá-psum ('endowed with all food')—comp. VIII, 22, 12. hávam vi<i>s</i>vápsum vi<i>s</i>vávâryam—or vi<i>s</i>va-púsham (Sa<i>m</i>h., vi<i>s</i>vâpúsham, 'all-nourishing') or vi<i>s</i>vá-apasam ('doing all works')? Also vi<i>s</i>vá-psnyam may be thought of. It is impossible, of course, to arrive at any certain conclusion.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:2:1">1</a>. 'He' seems to be Agni. Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, explains: dadânam id agnaye kurvâ<i>n</i>am eva mâm. This would lead to a translation like this: '(The enemies) did</p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>not deceive (me, the worshipper) who had addressed a hymn (to Agni).'</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:2:2">2</a>. On 'his' Sâya<i>n</i>a remarks, 'ya<i>g</i>amânasya mama.' But the word may refer to Agni.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:3:1">1</a>. There is no reason for abandoning here the usual meaning of ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>íya. On the gods seeking after Agni, comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:3:2">2</a>. It is very probable, to say the least, that 'they' are again the gods.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:4:1">1</a>. Is the first â´t dissyllabic? More probably the Pâda is deficient by one syllable.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:5:1">1</a>. Two syllables are wanting before the caesura of the first Pâda.</p>  
 <p>Note <a name="an_1:148:5:2">2</a>. Was there a belief that a blind man by turning his blind eyes on somebody could do him harm? Possibly we might have to translate: 'Him (his foes) blind and bereft of sight did not damage though looking at him (i. e. though turning their blind eyes on him).'—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'Could it be: Even the blind saw, but did not injure him (andhâ´<i>h</i> apa<i>s</i>yan ná dabhan); abhikhyâ´, when he was seen, no longer in the womb?'</p>
