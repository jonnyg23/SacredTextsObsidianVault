 <p>SHREE SHOOKDEO, the sage, said,--Raja! whilst Huri remained in the jungle pasturing the cows, all the women of Bruj went and sat near Nund's wife, and sung the praises of their lord, and related the sports in which Shree Krishnù had engaged in the forest.</p>  
 <p>"Friend! when he plays on the flute, animals and birds derive pleasure. Dewee, seated with her husband in a chariot, is fascinated; hearing the notes with the greatest delight. The bracelets and rings on his hand steal away all sensation from the agitated mind and body." Then one of the women of Bruj said, "The clouds were so overcome, that they ceased to thunder. Huri sings joyfully standing in one position, and makes his eye-brow, feet and cheek keep time. The doe and deer are fascinated with the notes. The Jumna is turned from its course; and the cows gather together. The charmed clouds cast a shadow, and form a canopy over Krishnù's head. At one time Krishnù retired to arbours with thick foliage; at another, all sat with him under a fig tree. The cows roamed about behind him; and when they were collected, he took them to water. In the evening Huri returned, and the cows lowed on hearing the sound of the flute."</p>

 <p>Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O great king! in this manner the cowherdesses constantly celebrated the great fame of Krishnù during the whole day: and going forth in the evening to meet Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, derived the greatest enjoyment from his society. And at the same time the Ranee Jusodha, having wiped the dust-covered face of her son in a most affectionate manner, was delighted to embrace him.</p>
