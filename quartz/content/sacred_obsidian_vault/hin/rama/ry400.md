 <h3 align="CENTER">CANTO I.: RÁMA'S SPEECH.</h3>
 <p>
 The son of Raghu heard, consoled,<br>
 The wondrous tale Hanumán told;<br>
 And, as his joyous hope grew high,<br>
 In friendly words he made reply:<br>
 
 </p><p>
 'Behold a mighty task achieved.<br>
 Which never heart but his conceived.<br>
 Who else across the sea can spring,<br>
 Save Váyu <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="ry401.htm#fn_906"><font size="1">2b</font></a> and the Feathered King? <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="ry401.htm#fn_907"><font size="1">3b</font></a><br>
 Who, pass the portals strong and high.<br>
 Which Nágas, <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="ry401.htm#fn_908"><font size="1">4b</font></a> Gods, and fiends defy,<br>
 Where Rávan's hosts their station keep,--<br>
 And come uninjured o'er the deep?<br>
 By such a deed the Wind-God's son<br>
 Good service to the king has done,<br>
 And saved from ruin and disgrace<br>
 Lakshman and me and Raghu's race.<br>
 Well has he planned and bravely fought.<br>
 And with due care my lady sought.<br>
 But of the sea I sadly think,<br>
 And the sweet hopes that cheered me sink.<br>
 How can we cross the leagues of foam<br>
 That keep us from the giant's home?<br>
 What can the Vánar legions more<br>
 Than muster on the ocean shore?'<br>
