 <p>21. He must not pronounce a benediction.</p>
 <p>22. He must not salute any one reverentially.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[10. 'Empty' means 'inhabited by no one else,' and implies that the house in question should be situated in a dark place, difficult of access. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>11. 'The article vâ implies that he must live there alone.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>14, 15. Nand. assigns as the reason of both these rules, 'lest he should not kill some insect.' Kullûka (on M. VI, 46) gives the same reason for the second rule, but the looking down, according to him, is ordained in. order that be may not accidentally tread upon a hair or other impure substance.</p>
 <p>17. The sense of this Sûtra is, that in doubtful cases he must act as his mind prompts him to do. (Nand.)</p>
 <p>21. 'The meaning is, that he must not utter a benediction when he has been reverentially saluted by any one. He must confine himself to saying, "O Nârâya<i>n</i>a." Others explain, that he must not utter a benediction in begging food.' (Nand.)</p>
 <p>22. 'The sense is, that he must not salute any one reverentially who has reverentially saluted him, nor return his greeting {footnote p. 281} otherwise than by saying, "O Nârâya<i>n</i>a." Others explain, that he must not make an obeisance in begging food.' (Nand.)]</p>

 <p>23. Should one man chop his one arm with an axe, and another sprinkle his other arm with sandal, he must neither curse the one in his mind, nor bless the other.</p>
 <p>24. He must constantly be intent upon stopping his breath, upon retention of the image formed in his mind, and upon meditation.</p>
 <p>25. He must reflect upon the transitoriness of the passage through mundane existence;</p>
 <p>26. And upon the impure nature of the body;</p>
 <p>27. And upon the destruction of beauty by old age;</p>

 <p>30. On his having to dwell in an embryo, covered with everlasting darkness;</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[24. Nand. quotes a passage of the Yoga<i>s</i>âstra, which states that one Dhâra<i>n</i>â = three Prâ<i>n</i>âyâmas (stoppings or regulations of the breath). A passage of the Gâru<i>d</i>a-pura<i>n</i>a quoted in the Petersburg Dictionary) states that one Dhâra<i>n</i>â = sixteen Prâ<i>n</i>âyâmas. I have taken the term dhâra<i>n</i>â in its ordinary acceptation of 'retention of an idea' (cf. Wilson, Vish<i>n</i>u-purâ<i>n</i>a V, 237) with regard to an analogous passage of Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya (III, 201), which is also quoted by Nand.,</p>
 <p>28. According to Nand,, the particle <i>k</i>a is used to include other diseases, love, anxiety or wrath, caused by enemies, and other mental pangs.</p>
 <p>29. They are, ignorance, egotism, love, wrath, and dread of temporal suffering (Nand., according to Patañ<i>g</i>ali). The particle <i>k</i>a, according to Nand., is used in order to imply meditation upon the thousand births which man has to pass through, as stated by Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya (III, 64).]</p>

 <p>31. And on (his having to dwell) between urine and fæces;</p>
 <p>32. On his having to suffer, (as an embryo,) pain from the cold and hot. (food and drink, which his mother happens to have taken);</p>

 <p>42. (And that) he who is unable to enjoy such pleasures (from sickness or some such cause), or who is unable to procure them (from poverty), suffers severe pangs.</p>
