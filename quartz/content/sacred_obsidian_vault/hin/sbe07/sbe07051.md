 <p>man worship, on the twelfth day, the venerable Vâsudeva (Vish<i>n</i>u).</p>
 <p>2. (He shall worship him) with flowers, incense, unguents, lamps, eatables (such as milk), and repasts given to Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>
 <p>3. By performing this rite (on the twelfth day of the bright half of every month, from the month Mârga<i>s</i>îrsha to the month Kârttika) for one year, he is purified from every sin.</p>
 <p>4. By performing it till he dies, he attains <i>S</i>vetadvîpa ('the white island,' the abode of Bhagavat).</p>
 <p>5. By performing it for a year on each twelfth day of both halves of a month, he attains heaven.</p>
 <p>6. By performing it (within the same intervals), till he dies, (he attains) the world of Vish<i>n</i>u.</p>
 <p>7. The same (heavenly rewards are gained by him who performs this rite) on each fifteenth day (after having fasted during the fourteenth).</p>
 <p>8. If he worships (according to the latter rite) Ke<i>s</i>ava (Vish<i>n</i>u) who has become one with Brahman, on the day of full moon, and Ke<i>s</i>ava absorbed in meditation, on the day of new moon, he will obtain a great reward.</p>

 <p>8. According to Nand., the two forms of Vish<i>n</i>u mentioned here must be considered as two separate deities, the one having to be invoked with the words 'Adoration to Brahmake<i>s</i>ava,' and the {footnote p. 157} other with the words 'Adoration to Yogake<i>s</i>ava.' 'A great reward' he interprets by 'a shape identical with that of Brahman.']</p>

 <p>9. If in a year on a day of full moon the moon and the planet Jupiter are seen together in the sky, it is called a great full moon.</p>
 <p>10. Gifts, fasts, and the like are declared to be imperishable on that day. The same is the case if a conjunction with the asterism. <i>S</i>rava<i>n</i>â falls on the twelfth day of the bright half (of any month).</p>
