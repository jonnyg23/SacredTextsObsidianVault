 <p>1. Nand. states that the <i>S</i>râddhas mentioned in this chapter are of the kâmya sort, i.e. 'offered for the gratification of a special desire.'</p>
 <p>2. <sup>1</sup> This is Nand.'s interpretation of the term saubhâgyam. It might also be taken in its usual acceptation, as meaning 'happiness.'</p>
 <p>8-35. Those names of the twenty-eight Nakshatras or lunar asterisms, which I have included in parentheses, are from Nand.'s Commentary. Most of the objects which are said to be gained by the <i>S</i>râddhas mentioned in Sûtras 8-35 are connected etymologically, or through their import, with the names of the particular Nakshatras under which they are performed. Thus the term push<i>t</i>i, 'prosperity,' in Sûtra 13, is etymologically connected with Pushya; the term mitra, 'friend,' in 22, is connected with Maitra; the term râ<i>g</i>yam, 'royalty,' in 23, is connected with <i>S</i>âkra, the name of that Nakshatra being derived from <i>S</i>akra, a name of Indra, the king of the gods, &amp;c.]</p>

 <font size="2"><p>[44. <sup>1</sup> Nand. infers from a passage of Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya (I, 266) that the term 'cattle' here refers to horses and other one-hoofed animals. See, however, the next Sûtra.</p>
 <p>48. The term saubhâgyam is stated by Nand. (with reference to Y. I, 2 64) to denote 'superiority among his kindred,' in this Sûtra. But there is no cogent reason for deviating here from that interpretation of the term which he proposes in his Commentary on Sûtras 2 and 16. See above.]</p>
