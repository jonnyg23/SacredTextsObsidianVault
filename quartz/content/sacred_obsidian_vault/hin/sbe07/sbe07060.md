 <p>10. What has been acquired as a bribe, as a fee (for crossing a river and the like, or for a bride, &amp;c.), or by the sale of forbidden articles (such as lac, or salt), or as a return for a benefit conferred, is denoted 'mottled wealth.'</p>
 <p>11. What has been acquired by servile attendance<sup>[1]</sup>, by gambling, by thieving, by begging, by deceit (as if a man says that he wants a present for another and takes it himself, or by forging gold or other metals), by robbery, or by fraud (as if a man shows one thing to a purchaser and delivers another to him instead), is called 'black property.'</p>
 <p>12. Whatever a man may do (in this world) with anything (he has, whether white, mottled, or black property) he will get his reward accordingly; both in the next world and in this.</p>
