 <h2 align="CENTER">KURU WOMEN VISIT THE BATTLE-FIELD</h2>
 <p>Spake the ancient Dhrita-rashtra, father of a hundred sons,<br>
 Sonless now and sorrow-stricken, dark his ebbing life-tide runs:</p>
 <p>"Gods fulfil my life's last wishes! Henchmen, yoke my royal car,<br>
 Dhrita-rashtra meets his princes in the silent field of war,</p>
 <p>Speed unto the Queen Gandhari, to the dames of Kuru's house,<br>
 To each dear departed warrior wends his fair and faithful spouse!"</p>
 <p>Queen Gandhari sorrow-laden with the ancient Pritha came,<br>
 And each weeping widowed princess and each wailing childless dame,</p>
 <p>And they saw the hoary monarch, father of a perished race,<br>
 Fresh and loud awoke their sorrow, welling tears suffused their face,</p>
 <p>Good Vidura ever gentle whispered comfort unto all,<br>
 Placed the dames within their chariots, left Hastina's palace hall!</p>
 <p>Loud the wail of woe and sorrow rose from every Kuru house,<br>
 Children wept beside their mothers for each widowed royal spouse,</p>
 <p>Veiléd dwellers of the palace, scarce the gods their face had seen,<br>
 Heedless now through mart and city sped each widowed childless queen,</p>
 <p>From their royal brow and bosom gem and jewel cast aside,<br>
 Loose their robes and loose their tresses, quenched their haughty queenly pride!</p>
 <p>So when falls the antlered monarch, struck by woe and sudden fear<br>
 Issuing from their snowy mountains listless stray the dappled deer,</p>
 <p>So when smit by sudden panic, milk-white mares that scour the plain,<br>
 Wildly toss their flowing tresses, shake their soft and glossy mane!</p>
 <p>Clinging to her weeping sister wept each dame in cureless pain,<br>
 For the lord the son or father in the deathful battle slain,</p>
 <p>Wept and smote her throbbing bosom and in bitter anguish wailed,<br>
 Till her senses reeled in sorrow, till her woman's reason failed!</p>
 <p>Veiléd queens and bashful maidens, erst they shunned the public eye,<br>
 Blush nor shame suffused their faces as they passed the city by,</p>
 <p>Gentle-bosomed, kindly hearted, erst they wiped each other's tear,<br>
 Now by common sorrow laden knew no sister's words of cheer!</p>
 <p>With this troop of wailing women, deep in woe, disconsolate,<br>
 Slow the monarch of the Kurus passed Hastina's outer gate,</p>
 <p>Men from stall and loom and anvil, men of every guild and trade,<br>
 Left the city with the monarch, through the open country strayed,</p>
 <p>And a universal sorrow filled the air and answering sky,<br>
 As when ends the mortal's Yuga and the end of world is nigh!</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">II</h2>
 <h2 align="CENTER">GANDHARI'S LAMENT FOR THE SLAIN</h2>
 <p>Stainless Queen and stainless woman, ever righteous ever good,<br>
 Stately in her mighty sorrow on the field Gandhari stood!</p>
 <p>Strewn with skulls and clotted tresses, darkened by the stream of gore,<br>
 With the limbs of countless warriors is the red field covered o'er,</p>
 <p>Elephants and steeds of battle, car-borne chiefs untimely slain,<br>
 Headless trunks and heads dissevered fill the red and ghastly plain,</p>
 <p>And the long-drawn howl of jackals o'er the scene of carnage rings,<br>
 And the vulture and the raven flap their dark and loathsome wings,</p>
 <p>Feasting on the blood of warriors foul <i>Pisachas</i> fill the air,<br>
 Viewless forms of hungry <i>Rakshas</i> limb from limb the corpses tear!</p>
 <p>Through this scene of death and carnage was the ancient monarch led,<br>
 Kuru dames with faltering footsteps stepped amidst the countless dead,</p>
 <p>And a piercing wail of anguish burst upon the echoing plain,<br>
 As they saw their sons or fathers, brothers, lords, amidst the slain,</p>
 <p>As they saw the wolves of jungle feed upon the destined prey,<br>
 Darksome wanderers of the midnight prowling in the light of day!</p>
 <p>Shriek of pain and wail of anguish o'er the ghastly field resound,<br>
 And their feeble footsteps falter and they sink upon the ground,</p>
 <p>Sense and life desert the mourners as they faint in common grief,<br>
 Death-like swoon succeeding sorrow yields a moment's short relief!</p>
 <p>Then a mighty sigh of anguish from Gandhari's bosom broke,<br>
 Gazing on her anguished daughters unto Krishna thus she spoke:</p>
 <p>"Mark my unconsoléd daughters, widowed queens of Kuru's house,<br>
 Wailing for their dear departed, like the osprey for her spouse!</p>
 <p>How each cold and fading feature wakes in them a woman's love,<br>
 How amidst the lifeless warriors still with restless steps they rove,</p>
 <p>Mothers hug their slaughtered children all unconscious in their sleep,<br>
 Widows bend upon their husbands and in ceaseless sorrow weep,</p>
 <p>Mighty Bhishma, hath he fallen, quenched is archer Karna's pride,<br>
 Doth the monarch of Panchala sleep by foeman Drona's side?</p>
 <p>Shining mail and costly jewels, royal bangles strew the plain,<br>
 Golden garlands rich and burnished deck the chiefs untimely slain,</p>
 <p>Lances hurled by stalwart fighters, clubs of mighty wrestlers killed<br>
 Swords and bows of ample measure, quivers still with arrows filled!</p>
 <p>Mark the unforgotten heroes, jungle prowlers 'mid them stray,<br>
 On their brow and mailéd bosoms heedless perch the birds of prey,</p>
 <p>Mark they great unconquered heroes famed on earth from west to east,<br>
 <i>Kankas</i> perch upon their foreheads, hungry wolves upon them feast!</p>
 <p>Mark the kings, on softest cushion scarce the needed rest they found,<br>
 Now they lie in peaceful slumber on the hard and reddened ground,</p>
 <p>Mark the youths who morn and evening listed to the minstrel's song,<br>
 In their ear the loathsome jackal doth his doleful wail prolong!</p>
 <p>See the chieftains with their maces and their swords of trusty steel,<br>
 Still they grasp their tried weapons,--do they still the life-pulse feel?"</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">III</h2>
 <h2 align="CENTER">GANDHARI'S LAMENT FOR DURYODHAN</h2>
 <p>Thus to Krishna, Queen Gandhari strove her woeful thoughts to tell,<br>
 When, alas, her wandering vision on her son Duryodhan fell,</p>
 <p>Sudden anguish smote her bosom and her senses seemed to stray,<br>
 Like a tree by tempest shaken senseless on the earth she lay!</p>
 <p>Once again she waked in sorrow, once again she cast her eye<br>
 Where her son in blood empurpled slept beneath the open sky,</p>
 <p>And she clasped her dear Duryodhan, held him close unto her breast,<br>
 Sobs convulsive shook her bosom as the lifeless form she prest,</p>
 <p>And her tears like rains of summer fell and washed his noble head,<br>
 Decked with garlands still untarnished, graced with <i>nishkas</i> bright and red!</p>
 <p>"'Mother!' said my dear Duryodhan when he went unto the war,<br>
 'Wish me joy and wish me triumph as I mount the battle-car,'</p>
 <p>'Son!' I said to dear Duryodhan, 'Heaven avert a cruel fate,<br>
 <i>Yato dharma stato jayah!</i> Triumph doth on Virtue wait!'</p>
 <p>But he set his heart on battle, by his valour wiped his sins,<br>
 Now he dwells in realms celestial which the faithful warrior wins,</p>
 <p>And I weep not for Duryodhan, like a prince he fought and fell,<br>
 But my sorrow-stricken husband, who can his misfortunes tell!</p>
 <p>Ay! my son was brave and princely, all resistless in the war,<br>
 Now he sleeps the sleep of warriors, sunk in gloom his glorious star,</p>
 <p>Ay! My son 'mid crownéd monarchs held the first and foremost way,<br>
 Now he rests upon the red earth, quenched his bright effulgent ray,</p>
 <p>Ay! my son the best of heroes, he hath won the warrior's sky,<br>
 Kshatras nobly conquer, Krishna, when in war they nobly die!</p>
 <p>Hark the loathsome cry of jackals, how the wolves their vigils keep,<br>
 Maidens rich in song and beauty erst were wont to watch his sleep,</p>
 <p>Hark the foul and blood-beaked vultures flap their wings upon the dead,<br>
 Maidens waved their feathery <i>pankhas</i> round Duryodhan's royal bed,</p>
 <p>Peerless bowman! mighty monarch! nations still his hests obeyed,<br>
 As a lion slays a tiger, Bhima hath Duryodhan slayed!</p>
 <p>Thirteen years o'er Kuru's empire proud Duryodhan held his sway,<br>
 Ruled Hastina's ancient city where fair Ganga's waters stray,</p>
 <p>I have seen his regal splendour with these ancient eyes of mine,<br>
 Elephants and battle-chariots, steeds of war and herds of kine,</p>
 <p>Kuru owns another master and Duryodhan's day is fled,<br>
 And I five to be a witness! Krishna, O that I were dead!</p>
 <p>Mark Duryodhan's noble widow, mother proud of Lakshman bold,<br>
 Queenly in her youth and beauty, like an altar of bright gold,</p>
 <p>Torn from husband's sweet embraces, from her son's entwining arms,<br>
 Doomed to life-long woe and anguish in her youth and in her charms,</p>
 <p>Rend my hard and stony bosom crushed beneath this cruel pain,<br>
 Should Gandhari live to witness noble son and grandson slain?</p>
 <p>Mark again Duryodhan's widow, how she hugs his gory head,<br>
 How with gentle hands and tender softly holds him on his bed,</p>
 <p>How from dear departed husband turns she to her dearer son,<br>
 And the tear-drops of the mother choke the widow's bitter groan,</p>
 <p>Like the fibre of the lotus tender-golden is her frame,<br>
 O my lotus! O my daughter! Bharat's pride and Kuru's fame!</p>
 <p>If the truth resides in Vedas, brave Duryodhan dwells above,<br>
 Wherefore linger we in sadness severed from his cherished love,</p>
 <p>If the truth resides in <i>Sastra</i>, dwells in sky my hero son,<br>
 Wherefore linger we in sorrow since their earthly task is done?</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">IV</h2>
 <h2 align="CENTER">FUNERAL RITE</h2>
 <p>Victor of a deathful battle, sad Yudhishthir viewed the plain,<br>
 Friends and kinsmen, kings and chieftains, countless troops untimely slain,</p>
 <p>And he spake to wise Sudharman pious priest of Kuru's race,<br>
 Unto Sanjay, unto Dhaumya, to Vidura full of grace,</p>
 <p>Spake unto the brave Yuyutsu, Kuru's last surviving chief,<br>
 Spake to faithful Indrasena, and to warriors sunk in grief:</p>
 <p>"Pious rites are due to foemen and to friends and kinsmen slain,<br>
 None shall lack a fitting funeral, none shall perish on the plain."</p>
 <p>Wise Vidura and his comrades sped on sacred duty bound,<br>
 Sandalwood and scented aloes, fragrant oil and perfumes found,</p>
 <p>Silken robes of costly splendour, fabrics by the artist wove,<br>
 Dry wood from the thorny jungle, perfume from the scented grove,</p>
 <p>Shattered cars and splintered lances, hewed and ready for the fire,<br>
 Piled and ranged in perfect order into many a funeral pyre.</p>
 <p>Kings and princes, noble warriors, were in rank and order laid,<br>
 And with streams of fragrant <i>ghrita</i> were the rich libations made,</p>
 <p>Blazed the fire with wondrous radiance by the rich libations fed,<br>
 Sanctifying and consuming mortal remnants of the dead.</p>
 <p>Brave Duryodhan and his brothers, Salya of the mighty car,<br>
 Bhurisravas king of nations, Jayadratha famed in war,</p>
 <p>Abhimanyu son of Arjun, Lakshman proud Duryodhan's son,<br>
 Somadatta and the Srinjays famed for deeds of valour done,</p>
 <p>Matsya's monarch proud Virata, Drupad fair Panchala's king,<br>
 And his sons, Panchala's princes, whose great deeds the minstrels sing,</p>
 <p>Cultured monarch of Kosala and Gandhara's wily lord,<br>
 Karna, proud and peerless archer, matchless with his flaming sword,</p>
 <p>Bhagadatta eastern monarch all resistless in his car,<br>
 Ghatotkacha son of Bhima, Alambusha famed in war,</p>
 <p>And a hundred other monarchs all received the pious rite,<br>
 Till the radiance of the fire-light chased the shadows of the night!</p>
 <i></i><p>Pitri-medha; due to fathers was performed with pious care,<br>
 Hymns and wails and lamentations mingled in the midnight air,</p>
 <p>Sacred songs of <i>rik</i> and <i>saman</i> rose with women's piercing wail,<br>
 And the creatures of the wide earth heard the sound subdued and pale,</p>
 <p>Smokeless and with radiant lustre shone each red and lighted pyre,<br>
 Like the planets of the bright sky throbbing with celestial fire!</p>
 <p>Men in nations, countless, nameless, from each court and camp afar,<br>
 From the east and west collected, fell in Kuru-Kshetra's war,</p>
 <p>Thousand fires for them were lighted, they received the pious rite,<br>
 Such was good Yudhishthir's mandate, such was wise Vidura's might,</p>
 <p>All the dead were burned to ashes and the sacred rite was o'er,<br>
 Dhrita-rashtra and Yudhishthir slowly walked to Ganga's shore!</p>
 <h2 align="CENTER">V</h2>
 <h2 align="CENTER">OBLATION TO KARNA</h2>
 <p>Sacred Ganga, ample-bosomed, sweeps along in regal pride,<br>
 Rolling down her limpid waters through high banks on either side,</p>
 <p>Childless dames and weeping widows thither in their anguish came,<br>
 Due and holy rites to render to departed chiefs of fame,</p>
 <p>Casting forth their jewelled girdles, gems and scarfs belaced with gold,<br>
 Gave oblations of the water unto warriors true and bold,</p>
 <p>Unto fathers, unto husbands, unto sons in battle slayed,<br>
 Offerings of the sacred water sorrowing wives and mothers made.</p>
 <p>And so great the host of mourners wending to perform the rite,<br>
 That their footsteps made a pathway in the sad and sacred site,</p>
 <p>And the shelving banks of Ganga, peopled by the sorrowing train,<br>
 Wide-expanding, vast and sealike, formed a scene of woe and pain!</p>
 <p>But a wave of keener sorrow swept o'er Pritha's heaving breast,<br>
 As unto her weeping children thus her secret she expressed:</p>
 <i></i><p>"He, my sons, the peerless bowman, mighty in his battle-car,<br>
 Who by will of fate untimely was by Arjun slain in war,</p>
 <p>He whom as the son of Radha, chariot-driver ye have thought,<br>
 But who shone with SURYA'S lustre as his countless foes he fought,</p>
 <p>He who faced your stoutest warriors and in battle never failed,<br>
 Bravely led the Kuru forces and in danger never quailed,</p>
 <p>He who knew no peer in prowess, owned in war no haughtier name,<br>
 Yielded life but not his honour and by death hath conquered fame,</p>
 <p>He in truth who never faltered, never left his vow undone,<br>
 Offer unto him oblation, Karna was my eldest son!</p>
 <p>Karna was your honoured elder and the Sun inspired his birth,<br>
 Karna in his rings and armour Sun-like trod the spacious earth!"</p>
 <p>Pritha spake; the Pandav brothers groaned in penitence and pain,<br>
 And they wept in woe and anguish for the brother they had slain.</p>
 <p>Hissing forth his sigh of anguish like a crushed and wounded snake,<br>
 Sad Yudhishthir to his mother thus his inward feelings spake:</p>
 <p>Didst thou, mother, bear the hero fathomless like ocean dread,<br>
 Whose unfailing glistening arrows like its countless billows sped,</p>
 <p>Didst thou bear that peerless archer all-resistless in his car,<br>
 Sweeping with the roar of ocean through the shattered ranks of war?</p>
 <p>Didst thou hide the mighty warrior, mortal man of heavenly birth,<br>
 Crushing 'neath his arm of valour all his foemen on the earth,</p>
 <p>Didst thou hide the birth and lineage of that chief of deathful ire,<br>
 As a man in folds of garments seeks to hide the flaming fire?</p>
 <p>Arjun wielder of Gandiva was for us no truer stay<br>
 Than was Karna for the Kurus in the battle's dread array,</p>
 <p>Monarchs matched not Karna's glory nor his deeds of valour done,<br>
 Midst the mighty car-borne warriors mightiest warrior Karna shone!</p>
 <p>Woe to us! our eldest brother we have in the battle slain,<br>
 And our nearest dearest elder fell upon the gory plain,</p>
 <p>Not the death of Abhimanyu from the fair Subhadra torn,<br>
 Not the slaughter of the princes by the proud Draupadi borne,</p>
 <p>Not the fall of friends and kinsmen and Panchala's mighty host,<br>
 Like thy death afflicts my bosom, noble Karna loved and lost!</p>
 <p>Monarch's empire, victor's glory, all the treasures earth can yield,<br>
 Righteous bliss and heavenly gladness, harvest of the heavenly field,</p>
 <p>All that wish can shape and utter, all that nourish hope and pride,<br>
 All were ours, O noble Karna, hadst thou rested by our side,</p>
 <p>And this carnage of the Kurus these sad eyes had never seen,<br>
 Peace had graced our blessed empire, happy would the earth have been!"</p>
 <p>Long bewailed the sad Yudhishthir for his elder loved and dead,<br>
 And oblation of the water to the noble Karna made,</p>
 <p>And the royal dames of Kuru viewed the sight with freshening pain,<br>
 Wept to see the good Yudhishthir offering to his brother slain,</p>
 <p>And the widowed queen of Karna with the women of his house<br>
 Gave oblations to her hero, wept her loved and slaughtered spouse!</p>
 <p>Done the rites to the, departed, done oblations to the dead,<br>
 Slowly then the sad survivors on the river's margin spread,</p>
 <p>Far along the shore and sandbank of the sacred sealike stream<br>
 Maid and matron lave their bodies 'neath the morning's holy beam,</p>
 <p>And ablutions done, the Kurus slow and sad and cheerless part,<br>
 Wend their way to far Hastina with a void and vacant heart.</p>
