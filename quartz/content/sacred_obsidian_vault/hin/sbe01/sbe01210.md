 <p>1. He (the sun), who shines, honoured this world (the body of the worshipper, by entering into it), in the form of man <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">2</font></a> (the worshipper who meditates on breath). For he who shines (the sun) is (the same as) the breath. He honoured this (body of the worshipper) during a hundred years, therefore there are a hundred years in the life of a man. Because he honoured him during a hundred years, therefore there are (the poets of the first Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Satar<i>k</i>in, (having honour for a</p>

 <p>2. He (breath) placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists. Because he placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists, therefore there are (the poets of the second to the ninth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Mâdhyamas. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), the Mâdhyama poets.</p>  
 <p>3. He as up-breathing is the swallower (g<i>ri</i>tsa), as down-breathing he is delight (mada). Because as up-breathing he is swallower (g<i>ri</i>tsa) and as down-breathing delight (mada), therefore there is (the poet of the second Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) G<i>ri</i>tsamada. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Gritsamada.</p>  
 <p>4. Of him. (breath) all this whatsoever was a friend. Because of him all (vi<i>s</i>vam) this whatsoever was a friend (mitram), therefore there is (the poet of the third Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra.</p>  
 <p>5. The Devas (speech, &amp;c.) said to him (the breath): 'He is to be loved by all of us.' Because the Devas said of him, that he was to be loved (vâma) by all of them, therefore there is (the poet of the fourth Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vâmadeva. Therefore people call him who is really Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), Vâmadeva.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_525"></a><a href="sbe01210.htm#fr_527">214:1</a> In the first adhyâya various forms of meditating on Uktha, conceived as Prâ<i>n</i>a (life), have been declared. In the second some other forms of meditation, all extremely fanciful, are added. They are of interest, however, as showing the existence of the hymns of the Rig-veda, divided and arranged as we now possess them, at the time when this Âra<i>n</i>yaka was composed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_526"></a><a href="sbe01210.htm#fr_528">214:2</a> The identity of the sun and of breath as living in man has been established before. It is the same power in both, conceived either adhidaivatam (mythological) or adhyâtmam (physiological).</p>
