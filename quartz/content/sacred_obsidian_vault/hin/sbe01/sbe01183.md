 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../../img/tn_hin.jpg"></a><br><i>The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)</i>, by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">FOURTH KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>1. Rv. I, 2, 1-3. Vâyav â yâhi dar<i>s</i>ateme somâ ara<i>m</i> k<i>ri</i>tâ<i>h</i>, 'Approach, O Vâyu, conspicuous, these Somas have been made ready.' Because the word ready occurs in these verses, therefore is this day (of the sacrifice) ready (and auspicious) for the sacrificer and for the gods.</p>  
 <p>2. Yes, this day is ready (and auspicious) to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>3. Rv. I, 2, 4-6. Indravâyû ime sutâ, â yâtam upa nishk<i>ri</i>tam, 'Indra and Vâyu, these Somas are prepared, come hither towards what has been prepared.' By nishk<i>ri</i>ta, prepared, he means what has been well prepared (sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>ta).</p>  
 <p>4. Indra and Vâyu go to what has been prepared by him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>

 <p>5. Rv. I, 2, 7. Mitra<i>m</i> huve pûtadaksham, dhiya<i>m</i> gh<i>ri</i>tâkî<i>m</i> sâdhantâ, 'I call Mitra of holy strength; (he and Varu<i>n</i>a) they fulfil the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.' Verily, speech is the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.</p>  
 <p>6. Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>7. Rv. I, 3, 1. A<i>s</i>vinâ ya<i>g</i>varîr isha<i>h</i>, 'O A<i>s</i>vinau, (eat) the sacrificial offerings.' Verily, the sacrificial offerings are food, and this serves for the acquirement of food.</p>  
 <p>8. Rv. I, 3, 3. Â yâta<i>m</i> rudravartanî, 'Come hither, ye Rudravartanî.'</p>  
 <p>9. The Asvinau go to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>10. Rv. I, 3, 4-6. Indrâ yâhi <i>k</i>itrabhâno, indrâ yâhi dhiyeshita<i>h</i>, indrâ yâhi tûtu<i>g</i>âna, 'Come hither, Indra, of bright splendour, Come hither, Indra, called by prayer, Come hither, Indra, quickly!' Thus he recites, Come hither, come hither!</p>  
 <p>11. Indra comes to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>12. Rv. I, 3, 7. Omâsa<i>s</i> <i>k</i>arsha<i>n</i>îdh<i>ri</i>to vi<i>s</i>ve devâsa â gata, 'Vi<i>s</i>ve Devas, protectors, supporters of men, come hither!'</p>  
 <p>13. Verily, the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devas come to the call of him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>14. Rv. I, 3, 7. Dâsvâ<i>m</i>so dâ<i>s</i>usha<i>h</i> sutam, 'Come ye givers to the libation of the giver!' By dâ<i>s</i>usha<i>h</i> he means dadusha<i>h</i>, i. e. to the libation of every one that gives.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. The gods fulfil his wish, with whatever wish he recites this verse,</p>  
 <p>16. (The wish of him) who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>17. Rv. I, 3, 10. Pâvakâ na<i>h</i> sarasvatî ya<i>g</i>ña<i>m</i> vash<i>t</i>u dhiyâvasu<i>h</i>, 'May the holy Sarasvatî accept our sacrifice, rich in prayer!' Speech is meant by 'rich in prayer.'</p>  
 <p>18. Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot<i>ri</i> priest who knows this, recites.</p>  
 <p>19. And when he says, 'May she accept our sacrifice!' what he means is, 'May she carry off our sacrifice!'</p>  
 <p>20. If these verses are recited straight on, they are twenty-one. Man also consists of twenty-one. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, and the trunk the twenty-first. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-first, by this hymn <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>21. By repeating the first and the last verses thrice, they become twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the twenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn'.</p>  
 <p>Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five, yea, twenty-five.</p>
