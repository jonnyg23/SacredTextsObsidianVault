 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="../../img/tn_hin.jpg"></a><br><i>The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)</i>, by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">SECOND KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>1. He who knows the gradual development of the self in him (the man conceived as the uktha), obtains himself more development.</p>  
 <p>2. There are herbs and trees and all that is animated, and he knows the self gradually developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only is seen <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but thought (<i>k</i>itta) in animated beings.</p>  
 <p>Among animated beings again the self develops gradually, for in some sap (blood) is seen (as well as thought), but in others thought is not seen.</p>  
 <p>4. And in man again the self develops gradually, for he is most endowed with knowledge. He says what he has known, he sees what he has known <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He knows what is to happen to-morrow, he knows heaven and hell. By means of the mortal he desires the immortal--thus is he endowed.</p>  
 <p>5. With regard to the other animals hunger and thirst only are a kind of understanding. But they do not say what they have known, nor do they see</p>

 <p>what they have known. They do not know what is to happen to-morrow, nor heaven and hell. They go so far and no further, for they are born according to their knowledge (in a former life).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe01215.htm#fr_553">222:1</a> This treats of the gradual development of life in man, particularly of the development of a thinking soul (<i>k</i>aitanya).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe01215.htm#fr_555">222:3</a> What he has known yesterday he remembers, and is able to say before men, I know this. And when he has known a thing he remembers it, and goes to the same place to see it again. Comm.</p>
