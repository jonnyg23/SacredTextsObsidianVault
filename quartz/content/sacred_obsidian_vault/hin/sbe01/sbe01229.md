 <p>1. Next comes the meditation as taught by <i>S</i>âkalya.</p>

 <p>2. The first half is the earth, the second half heaven, their uniting the rain, the uniter Par<i>g</i>anya <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>3. And so it is when he (Par<i>g</i>anya) rains thus strongly, without ceasing, day and night <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">2</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>4. Then they say also (in ordinary language), 'Heaven and earth have come together.'</p>  
 <p>5. So much with regard to the deities; now with regard to the body:--</p>  
 <p>6. Every man is indeed like an egg <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">3</font></a>. There are two halves <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">4</font></a> (of him), thus they say: 'This half is the earth, that half heaven.' And there between them is the ether (the space of the mouth), like the ether between heaven and earth. In this ether there (in the mouth) the breath is fixed, as in that other ether the air is fixed. And as there are those three luminaries (in heaven), there are these three luminaries in man.</p>  
 <p>7. As there is that sun in heaven, there is this eye in the head. As there is that lightning in the sky, there is this heart in the body; as there is that fire on earth, there is this seed in the member.</p>  
 <p>8. Having thus represented the self (body) as the whole world, <i>S</i>âkalya said: This half is the earth, that half heaven.</p>  
 <p>9. He who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>  <h3 align="center">THIRD KHA<i>N</i><i>D</i>A <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</h3>  
 <p>1. Next come the reciters of the Nirbhu<i>g</i>a <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>2. Nirbhu<i>g</i>a abides on earth, Prat<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>a in heaven, the Ubhayamantare<i>n</i>a in the sky.</p>  
 <p>3. Now, if any one should chide him who recites the Nirbhu<i>g</i>a, let him answer: 'Thou art fallen from the two lower places <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' If any one should chide him who recites the Prat<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>a, let him answer: 'Thou art fallen from the two higher places <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' But he who recites the Ubhayamantare<i>n</i>a, there is no chiding him.</p>  
 <p>4. For when he turns out the Sandhi (the union of words), that is the form of Nirbhu<i>g</i>a <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and when be pronounces two syllables pure (without modification), that is the form of Prat<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>a <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">6</font></a>. This comes</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>first <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">1</font></a>. By the Ubhayamantara (what is between the two) both are fulfilled (both the sandhi and the pada).</p>  
 <p>5. Let him who wishes for proper food say the Nirbhu<i>g</i>a; let him who wishes for Svarga, say the Prat<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>a; let him who wishes for both say the Ubhayamantare<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>6. Now if another man (an enemy) should chide him who says the Nirbhu<i>g</i>a, let him say to him: 'Thou hast offended the earth, the deity; the earth, the deity, will strike thee.'</p>  
 <p>If another man should chide him who says the Prat<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>a, let him say to him: 'Thou hast offended heaven, the deity; heaven, the deity, will strike thee.'</p>  
 <p>If another man should chide him who says the Ubhayamantare<i>n</i>a, let him say to him: 'Thou hast offended the sky, the deity; the sky, the deity, will strike thee.'</p>  
 <p>7. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who speaks to him or does not speak to him, depend upon it, it will come to pass.</p>  
 <p>8. But to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a let him not say anything except what is auspicious.</p>  
 <p>9. Only he may curse a Brâhma<i>n</i>a in excessive wealth <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>10. Nay, not even in excessive wealth should he curse a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, but he should say, 'I bow before Brâhma<i>n</i>as,'--thus says <i>S</i>ûravîra Mâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ûkeya.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_634"></a><a href="sbe01229.htm#fr_636">250:2</a> Nirbhu<i>g</i>a(n) is the recitation of the Veda without intervals, therefore the same as Sa<i>m</i>hitâ. Prat<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>a is the recitation of each word by itself (pada-pâ<i>th</i>a); Ubhayamantarena, the between the two, is the intertwining of Sa<i>m</i>hitâ and Pada-pâ<i>th</i>a, the so-called Krama-pâ<i>th</i>a. By reciting the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ inattentively, one may use forms which belong to the Pada-text; and by reciting the Pada inattentively, one may use forms which belong to the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ-text. But in reciting the Krama both the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ and Pada forms are used together, and therefore mistakes are less likely to happen.</p>
