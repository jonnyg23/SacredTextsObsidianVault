 <p>2. Indra said to him: '<i>Ri</i>shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. <i>Ri</i>shi, repeat a second hymn <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'

 <p>3. Indra said to him: '<i>Ri</i>shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. <i>Ri</i>shi, repeat a third hymn.' Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, 'This (the verses of the hymn) is food,' and repeated the thousand B<i>ri</i>hatî verses. By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).</p>  
 <p>4. Indra said to him: '<i>Ri</i>shi, thou hast come to my delightful home. I grant thee a boon.' Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra said: 'May I know thee.' Indra said: 'I am Prâ<i>n</i>a (breath), O <i>Ri</i>shi, thou art Prâ<i>n</i>a, all things are Prâ<i>n</i>a. For it is Prâ<i>n</i>a who shines as the sun, and I here pervade all regions under that form. This food of mine (the hymn) is my friend and my support (dakshi<i>n</i>a). This is the food prepared by Visvâmitra. I am verily he who shines (the sun).'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_537"></a><a href="sbe01212.htm#fr_539">218:4</a> Upanishasasâda, instead of upanishasâda. The mistake is probably due to a correction, sa for sha; the commentator, however, considers it as a Vedic license. Skâro 'dhika<i>s</i> <i>kh</i>ândasa<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_538"></a><a href="sbe01212.htm#fr_540">218:5</a> These are meant for the Nishkevalya hymn recited at the noon-libation of the Mahâvrata. That hymn consists of ten parts, corresponding, as we saw, to ten parts of a bird, viz. its body, neck, head, root of wings, right wing, left wing, tail, belly, chest, and thighs. The verses corresponding to these ten parts, beginning with tad id asa bhuvaneshu <i>g</i>yesh<i>th</i>am, are given in the first Âra<i>n</i>yaka, and more fully in the fifth Âra<i>n</i>yaka by <i>S</i>aunaka. <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a> Though they consist of many metres, yet, when one counts the syllables, they give a thousand B<i>ri</i>hatî verses, each consisting of thirty-six syllables.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_539"></a><a href="sbe01212.htm#fr_541">219:1</a> Although the Nishkevalya is but one hymn, consisting of eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, yet as these eighty t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as were represented as three kinds of food (see Ait. Âr. II, 1, 2, 2-4), the hymn is represented as three hymns, first as eighty Gâyatrî t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, then as eighty B<i>ri</i>hatî t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as, lastly as eighty Ush<i>n</i>ih t<i>ri</i><i>k</i>as.</p>
