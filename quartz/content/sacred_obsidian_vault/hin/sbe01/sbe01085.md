 <p>1. 'A diver-bird (Madgu, meant for Prâ<i>n</i>a) will declare to you another foot of Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>(After these words of the Ha<i>m</i>sa), Satyakâma, on the morrow, drove the cows onward. And when they came towards the evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid wood on the fire, and sat down behind the fire, looking toward the east.</p>  
 <p>2. Then a diver flew near and said to him 'Satyakâma.' He replied: 'Sir.'</p>  
 <p>3. The diver said: 'Friend, I will declare unto you one foot of Brahman!</p>  
 <p>'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.</p>  
 <p>He said to him: 'Breath is one quarter, the eye is one quarter, the ear is one quarter, the mind is one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, and called Âyatanavat (having a home).</p>  
 <p>'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of Âyatanavat, becomes possessed of a home in this world. He conquers the worlds which offer a home, whoever knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of Âyatanavat.'</p>
