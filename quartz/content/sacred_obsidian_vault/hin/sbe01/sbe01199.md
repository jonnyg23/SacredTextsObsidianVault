 <p>1. He recites the Va<i>s</i>a hymn <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">1</font></a>, wishing, May everything be in my power.</p>  
 <p>2. They (its verses) are twenty-one <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for twenty-one are the parts (the lungs, spleen, &amp;c.) in the belly.</p>  
 <p>3. Then the Ekavi<i>m</i>sa is verily the support of all Stomas, and the belly the support of all food.</p>  
 <p>4. They consist of different metres. Verily, the intestines are confused, some small, some large.</p>  
 <p>5. He recites them with the pra<i>n</i>ava <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">3</font></a>, according to the metre <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and according to rule <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Verily, the intestines are according to rule, as it were; some shorter, some longer.</p>  
 <p>6. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins the joints; with breath.</p>  
 <p>7. After having recited that verse twelve times he</p>

 <p>leaves it off there. These prâ<i>n</i>as are verily twelvefold, seven in the head, two on the breast, three below. In these twelve places the prâ<i>n</i>as are contained, there they are perfect. Therefore he leaves it off there <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="sbe01200.htm#fn_480"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>8. The hymn indrâgnî yuva<i>m</i> su nah (Rv. VIII, 40) forms the two thighs (of the bird) belonging to Indra and Agni, the two supports with broad bones.</p>  
 <p>9. These (verses) consist of six feet, so that they may stand firm. Man stands firm on two feet, animals on four. He thus places man (the sacrificer), standing on two feet, among four-footed cattle.</p>  
 <p>10. The second verse has seven feet, and he makes it into a Gâyatrî and Anush<i>t</i>ubh. Gâyatrî is Brahman, Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech; and he thus puts together speech with Brahman.</p>  
 <p>11. He recites a Trish<i>t</i>ubh at the end. Trish<i>t</i>ubh is strength, and thus does he come round animals by strength. Therefore animals come near where there is strength (of command, &amp;c.); they come to be roused and to rise up, (they obey the commands of a strong shepherd.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_475"></a><a href="sbe01199.htm#fr_477">193:1</a> Having recited the verses which form the body, neck, head, wings, and tail of the bird, also the food intended for the bird, he now describes the Va<i>s</i>a hymn, i.e. the hymn composed by Va<i>s</i>a, Rv. VIII, 46. That hymn takes the place of the stomach which receives the food intended for the bird. Cf. Ait. Âr. V, 2, 5. In I, 5, 2, 4 it is called a Nivid.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_476"></a><a href="sbe01199.htm#fr_478">193:2</a> Verses 1-20 of the Vasa hymn, and one Sûdadohas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_477"></a><a href="sbe01199.htm#fr_479">193:3</a> Pra<i>n</i>âvam means 'with pra<i>n</i>ava,' i.e. inserting Om in the proper places.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_478"></a><a href="sbe01199.htm#fr_480">193:4</a> According as the metres of the different verses are fixed by <i>S</i>aunaka, Ait. Âr. V, 2, 5, who says that verse 15 is Dvipadâ, and that the last four words, nûnam atha, form an Ekapadâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_479"></a><a href="sbe01199.htm#fr_481">193:5</a> According to rule, i.e. so that they should come right as Â<i>s</i>valâyana has prescribed the recitation of Dvipadâ and Ekapadâ verses. In a Dvipadâ there should be a stop after the first foot, and Om at the end o f the second. Ira an Ekapadâ there should be Om at the beginning and at the end.</p>
