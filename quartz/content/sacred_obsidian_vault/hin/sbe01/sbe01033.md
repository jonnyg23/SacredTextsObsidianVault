 <p>1. Now follows the udgîtha of the dogs. Vaka Dâlbhya, or, as he was also called, Glâva Maitreya, went out to repeat the Veda (in a quiet place).</p>  
 <p>2. A white (dog) appeared before him, and other dogs gathering round him, said to him: 'Sir, sing and get us food, we are hungry.'</p>  
 <p>3. The white dog said to them: 'Come to me to-morrow morning.' Vaka Dâlbhya, or, as he was also called, Glâva Maitreya, watched.</p>  
 <p>4. The dogs came on, holding together, each dog keeping the tail of the preceding dog in his mouth, as the priests do when they are going to sing praises with the Vahishpavamâna hymn <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">2</font></a>. After they had settled down, they began to say Hiṅ.</p>  
 <p>5. 'Om, let us eat! Om, let us drink! Om, may the divine Varu<i>n</i>a, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, Savit<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">3</font></a> bring us food! Lord of food, bring hither food, bring it, Om!'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="sbe01032.htm#fr_114">21:1</a> There are certain etymological fancies for assigning each deity to a certain portion of the Sâma-veda ceremonial. Thus prâ<i>n</i>a is assigned to the prastâva, because both words begin with pra. Âditya is assigned to the udgîtha, because the sun is ut. Anna, food, is assigned to the pratihâra, because food is taken, pratih<i>ri</i>yate, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_114"></a><a href="sbe01033.htm#fr_115">21:2</a> This alludes to a ceremony where the priests have to walk in procession, each priest holding the gown of the preceding priest.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="sbe01033.htm#fr_116">21:3</a> The commentator explains Varu<i>n</i>a and Pra<i>g</i>âpati as epithets of Savit<i>ri</i>, or the sun, meaning rain-giver and man-protector.</p>
