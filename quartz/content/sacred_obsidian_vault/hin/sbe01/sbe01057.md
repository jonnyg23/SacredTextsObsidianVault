 <p>1. There are three branches of the law. Sacrifice, study, and charity are the first <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>2. Austerity the second, and to dwell as a Brahma<i>k</i>ârin in the house of a tutor, always mortifying the body in the house of a tutor, is the third. All these obtain the worlds of the blessed; but the Brahmasa<i>m</i>stha alone (he who is firmly grounded in Brahman) obtains immortality.</p>  
 <p>3. Pra<i>g</i>âpati brooded on the worlds. From them, thus brooded on, the threefold knowledge (sacrifice) issued forth. He brooded on it, and from it, thus brooded on, issued the three syllables, Bhû<i>h</i>, Bhuva<i>h</i>, Sva<i>h</i>.</p>  
 <p>4. He brooded on them, and from them, thus brooded on, issued the Om. As all leaves are attached to a stalk, so is all speech (all words) attached to the Om (Brahman). Om is all this, yea, Om is all this.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="sbe01057.htm#fr_157">35:1</a> Not the first in rank or succession, but only in enumerating the three branches of the law. This first branch corresponds to the second stage, the â<i>s</i>rama of the householder. Austerity is meant for the Vânaprastha, the third â<i>s</i>rama, while the third is intended for the Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, the student, only that the naish<i>th</i>ika or perpetual Brahma<i>k</i>ârin here takes the place of the ordinary student. The Brahmasa<i>m</i>stha would represent the fourth â<i>s</i>rama, that of the Sannyâsin or parivrâ<i>g</i>, who has ceased to perform any works, even the tapas or austerities of the Vânaprastha.</p>
