 <h3 align="CENTER">BABY'S WORLD</h3>
 <p>I wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby's very own world.</p>
 <p>I know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoops down to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows.</p>
 <p>Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they never could move, come creeping to his window with their stories and with trays crowded with bright toys.</p>
 <p>I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind, and out beyond all bounds;</p>
 <p>Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms of kings of no history;</p>
 <p>Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, and Truth sets Fact free from its fetters.</p>
