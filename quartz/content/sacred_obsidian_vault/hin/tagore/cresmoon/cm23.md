 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FURTHER BANK</h3>
 <p>I long to go over there to the further bank of the river,</p>
 <p>Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;</p>
 <p>Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;</p>
 <p>Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the riverside pasture;</p>
 <p>Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds,</p>
 <p>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferry when I am grown up.</p>
 <p>They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank,</p>
 <p>Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and thick reeds grow round the margins where waterbirds lay their eggs;</p>
 <p>Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny footprints upon the clean soft mud;</p>
 <p>Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with white flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.</p>
 <p>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.</p>
 <p>I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are bathing.</p>
 <p>When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon, I shall come running to you, saying, "Mother, I am hungry!"</p>
 <p>When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees, I shall come back in the dusk.</p>
 <p>I shall never go away from you into the town to work like father.</p>
 <p>Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.</p>
