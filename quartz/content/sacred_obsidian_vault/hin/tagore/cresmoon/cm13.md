 <h3 align="CENTER">THE JUDGE</h3>
 <p>Say of him what you please, but I know my child's failings.</p>
 <p>I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my little child.</p>
 <p>How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh his merits against his faults?</p>
 <p>When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my being.</p>
 <p>When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him.</p>
 <p>I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may chastise who loves.</p>
