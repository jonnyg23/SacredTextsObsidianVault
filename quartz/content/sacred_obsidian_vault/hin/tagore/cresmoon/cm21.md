 <h3 align="CENTER">PAPER BOATS</h3>

 <p align="CENTER">[Illustration: From a drawing by Surendranath Ganguli]</p>
 <p>Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running stream.</p>
 <p>In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of the village where I live.</p>
 <p>I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who I am.</p>
 <p>I load my little boats with <i>shiuli</i> flowers from our garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night.</p>
 <p>I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds setting their white bulging sails.</p>
 <p>I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race with my boats!</p>
 <p>When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.</p>
 <p>The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading is their baskets full of dreams.</p>
