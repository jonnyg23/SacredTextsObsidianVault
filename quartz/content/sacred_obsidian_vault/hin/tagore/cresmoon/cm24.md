 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FLOWER-SCHOOL</h3>
 <p>When storm clouds rumble in the sky and June showers come down,</p>
 <p>The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its bagpipes among the bamboos.</p>
 <p>Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.</p>
 <p>Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.</p>
 <p>They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand in a corner.</p>
 <p>When the rains come they have their holidays.</p>
 <p>Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.</p>
 <p>Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars are.</p>
 <p>Haven't you seen how eager they are to get there? Don't you know why they are in such a hurry?</p>
 <p>Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms: they have their mother as I have my own.</p>
