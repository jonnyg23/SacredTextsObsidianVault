 <h3 align="CENTER">DEFAMATION</h3>
 <p>Why are those tears in your eyes, my child?</p>
 <p>How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing?</p>
 <p>You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing--is that why they call you dirty?</p>
 <p>O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has smudged its face with ink?</p>
 <p>For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are ready to find fault for nothing.</p>
 <p>You tore your clothes while playing--is that why they call you untidy?</p>
 <p>O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles through its ragged clouds?</p>
 <p>Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.</p>
 <p>Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.</p>
 <p>They make a long list of your misdeeds. Everybody knows how you love sweet things--is that why they call you greedy?</p>
 <p>O, fie! What then would they call us who love you?</p>
