 <h3 align="CENTER">THE LAST BARGAIN</h3>
 <p>"Come and hire me," I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road.</p>
 <p>Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot.</p>
 <p>He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power."</p>
 <p>But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot.</p>
 <p>In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors.</p>
 <p>I wandered along the crooked lane.</p>
 <p>An old man came out with his bag of gold.</p>
 <p>He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money."</p>
 <p>He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.</p>
 <p>It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.</p>
 <p>The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."</p>
 <p>Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.</p>
 <p>The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.</p>
 <p>A child sat playing with shells.</p>
 <p>He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with nothing."</p>
 <p>From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.</p>
