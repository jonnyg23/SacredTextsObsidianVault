 <p>If people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish into the air.</p>
 <p>The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.</p>
 <p>The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.</p>
 <p>But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.</p>
 <p>It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the <i>tulsi</i> plant stands.</p>
 <p>The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.</p>
 <p>There is none in the world who can find her but myself.</p>
 <p>She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.</p>
 <p>She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand, and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.</p>
 <p>But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the <i>tulsi</i> plant stands.</p>
 <p>When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.</p>
 <p>I sit in the corner where the shadows of the walls meet together.</p>
 <p>Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she knows where the barber in the story lives.</p>
 <p>But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.</p>
 <p>It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the <i>tulsi</i> plant stands.</p>
