 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Hymns of the Atharva Veda</i>, by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1895], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">HYMN III</h3>  <h4 align="center">A glorification of the Odana or oblation of boiled rice</h4>  
 <p>   <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100301">1</a></font></span>1. Of that Odana Brihaspati is the head, Brahma the mouth.<br>    <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100302">2</a></font></span>2. Heaven and Earth are the ears, the Sun and Moon are the<br>    eyes, the seven Rishis are the vital airs inhaled and exhaled. <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a><br>    3. Vision is the pestle, Desire the mortar. 4. Diti is the<br>    winnowing basket, Aditi is she who holds it, Vāta is the sifter.<br>    5. Horses are the grains, oxen the winnowed ricegrains, gnats<br>    the husks. 6. Kabru is the husked grain, the rain cloud is the<br>    reed. 7. Grey iron is its flesh, copper its blood. 8. Tin is its<br>    ashes, gold its colour, the blue lotus flower its scent. 9. The<br>    threshing-floor is its dish, the wooden swords its shoulders,<br>    the car-shafts its backbones. 10. Collar-bones are its entrails,<br>    straps its intestines. 11. This earth, verily becomes the jar,<br>    and heaven the cover of the Odana as it is cooking.<br>    12. Furrows are its ribs, sandy soils the undigested contents<br>    of its stomach. 13. Law is its water for the hands and family<br>    custom its aspersion. 14. The jar covered with the Rich has<br>    been solemnly directed by the priestly office. 15. Received by<br>    the Brāhman, it has been carried round. 16. The Brihat is,<br>    the stirring-spoon, the Rathantara the ladle. 17. The Seasons<br>    are the dressers, the Groups of Seasons kindle the fire.<br>    18. The caldron flames round the oblation (<i>charu</i>) whose<br>    mouth consists of five openings.<br>    <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100319">19</a></font></span>19. The sacrificial word, all worlds are to be won with Odana.<br>    <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100320">20</a></font></span>20. Whereon in order rest the three, the ocean, and the heaven, and<br>    earth.<br>    <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100321">21</a></font></span>21. Within the residue whereof the Gods arranged six eightieth<br>    parts—<br>    <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100322">22</a></font></span>22. I ask thee, of this Odana what is the mighty magnitude.<br>    <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100323">23</a></font></span>23. He who may know the magnitude of the Odana. 24. Would say,<br>   Not small, nor devoid of moistening sauce; not this, nor any-<br>    thing whatever. 25. He would not declare it to be greater than<br>    the giver imagines it to be. 26. The theologians say, Thou<br>    hast eaten the averted Odana and the Odana turned hither-<br>    ward. 27. Thou hast eaten the Odana and the Odana will eat<br>    thee. 28. Thou hast eaten this averted; thy inward breath will<br>    leave thee; so he said to this one. 29. Thou hast eaten this<br>    turned hitherward; thy downward breath will leave thee; so<br>    he said to this one. 30. I indeed have not eaten the Odana,<br>    nor has the Odana eaten me. 31. The Odana has just eaten<br>    the Odana.</p>  <h4 align="center">2</h4>  
 <p>   <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1100332">32</a></font></span>32. And thence he said to this one, Thou hast eaten this with a<a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a><br>    different head from that with which the ancient Rishis ate:<br>    thy offspring, reckoning from the eldest, will die. I have eaten<br>    it neither turned downward, nor turned away, nor turned<br>    hitherward. With Brihaspati as head: with him I have eaten,<br>    with him have I come to it. Now this Odana is complete with<br>    all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his<br>    members, joints, and body is he who possess this knowledge.<br>    33. And thence he said to him, Thou hast eaten this with<br>    other ears than those with which the ancient Rishis ate it.<br>    Thou wilt be deaf. I have eaten it neither, etc. (as in verse 32).<br>    With Heaven and Earth as ears, with these I have eaten it,<br>    with these I have come to it. Now this Odana, etc. (as in 32).<br>    34. And thence he said to him. Thou hast eaten this with<br>    other eyes . . . thou wilt be blind. With Sun and Moon, etc.<br>    35. And thence, etc. . . with other month. Thy offspring will<br>    die, reckoning from the head . . . With Brahma as mouth.<br>    36. And thence, etc. . . . with other tongue . . . Thy tongue<br>    will die . . . With the tongue of Agni. 37. And thence, etc. . .<br>    With other teeth . . . Thy teeth will fall out . . . With the<br>    Seasons as teeth. 38. And thence, etc. . . . with other vital<br>    airs. . . . Thy vital airs will leave thee . . . With the Seven<br>    Rishis as the vital airs. 39. And thence, etc. . . . with other<br>    expanse . . . Consumption will destroy thee . . . With the<br>    firmament as expanse. 40 And thence, etc. . . . with other<br>    back. . . . Lightning will slay thee. . . With the heaven as<br>    back. 41. And thence, etc. . . . with other breast . . . Thou<br>    wilt fail in agriculture. . . . With the earth as breast. 42. And<br>    thence, etc. . . . with other belly . . . colic will destroy thee . . .<br>    With truth as belly. 43. And thence, etc. . . . with other<br>    abdomen . . . Thou wilt die in the water . . . With the sea as<br>    abdomen. 44. And thence, etc. . . . with other thighs . . .<br>    Thy thigh will perish . . . With Mitra-Varuna as thighs.<br>    45. And thence, etc. . . . with other knees . . . Thou wilt<br>    become a sick man . . . With the knees of Tvashtar. 46. And<br>    thence, etc. . . . with other feet . . . Thou wilt become a<br>    wanderer . . . With the feet of the Asvins. 47. And thence,<br>    etc. . . with other fore-parts of the feet . . . A serpent will<br>    kill thee . . . With the fore-parts of Savitar's feet. 48. And<br>    thence, etc. . . . with other hands . . . The Brāhmana (divine<br>    power) will kill thee . . . With the hands of Right. 49. And <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a><br>    thence, etc. . . . with other basis . . . Without standing-ground<br>    and resting-place thou wilt die . . . Having taken my stand on<br>    truth. With this I ate it, with this I came to it. Now this<br>    Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body.<br>    Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he<br>    who possesses this knowledge.</p>
