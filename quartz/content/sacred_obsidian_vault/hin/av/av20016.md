 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001601">1</a></font></span>Like birds who keep their watch, plashing in water, like the loud<br>    voices of the thundering rain-cloud,<br>   Like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to<br>   Brihaspati our hymns have sounded.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001602">2</a></font></span>The son of Angiras, meeting the cattle, as Bhaga, brought in<br>   Aryaman among us.<br>   As Friend of men he decks the wife and husband. As for the<br>    race, Brihaspati, nerve our coursers.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001603">3</a></font></span>Brihaspati, having won them from the mountains, strewed down,<br>    like barley out of winnowing-baskets,<br>   The vigorous, wandering cows who aid the pious, desired of all,<br>    of blameless form, well-coloured.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001604">4</a></font></span>As the Sun dews with meath the seat of Order, and casts a flam-<br>    ing meteor down from heaven,<br>   So from the rock Brihaspati forced the cattle, and cleft the<br>    earth's skin as it were with water.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001605">5</a></font></span>Forth from mid-air with light he draye the darkness, as the gale<br>    blows a lily from the river.<br>   Like the wind grasping at the cloud of Vala, Brihaspati gathered<br>    to himself the cattle.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001606">6</a></font></span>Brihaspati, when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the<br>    weapon of reviling Vala,<br>   Consumed him as tongues eat what teeth have compassed: he<br>    threw the prisons of the red cows open.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001607">7</a></font></span>That secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave<br>   Brihaspati discovered,<br>   And draye, himself, the bright kine from the mountain, like a<br>    bird's young after the eggs' disclosure.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001608">8</a></font></span>He looked around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who<br>    eyes a fish in scanty water.<br>   Brihaspati, cleaving through with varied clamour, brought it<br>    forth like a bowl from out the timber. <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></a><br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001609">9</a></font></span>He found the light of heaven, and fire, and Morning: with lucid<br>    rays he forced apart the darkness.<br>   As from a joint, Brihaspati took the marrow of Vala as he<br>    gloried in his cattle.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001610">10</a></font></span>As trees for foliage robbed by winter, Vala mourned for the<br>    cows Brihaspati had taken.<br>   He did a deed ne'er done, ne'er to be equalled, whereby the sun<br>    and moon ascend alternate.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001611">11</a></font></span>Like a dark steed adorned with pearl, the Fathers have decorat-<br>    ed heaven with constellations.<br>   They set the light in day, in night the darkness, Brihaspati cleft<br>    the rock and found the cattle.<br> <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2001612">12</a></font></span>This homage have we offered to the Cloud-God who thunders<br>    out to many in succession.<br>   May this Brihaspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and<br>    horses, men, and heroes.</p>
