 <p>5. (Meditation) thus being equal, there is combination (of gu<i>n</i>as); on account of non-difference of purport in the case of what subserves injunction.</p>
 <p>The meditation in all Vedânta-texts thus being the same, the qualities mentioned in one text are to be combined with those mentioned in another; 'on account of non-difference of purport in the case of what subserves injunction.' We find that in connexion with certain injunctions of meditation--such as the meditation on Vai<i>s</i>vânara, or the small ether within the heart--the text of some individual Vedânta-book mentions certain secondary matters (qualities, gu<i>n</i>a) which subserve that meditation; and as these gu<i>n</i>as are connected with the meditation they are to be comprised in it, so that they may accomplish their aim, i.e. of subserving the meditation. For the same reason therefore we have to enclose in the meditation gu<i>n</i>as mentioned in other Vedânta-texts; for being also connected with the meditation they subserve it in the same way.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'what is intimated by all Vedânta-texts.</p>
