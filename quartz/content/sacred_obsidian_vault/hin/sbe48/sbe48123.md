 <p>24. But with reference to the heart, men being qualified.</p>
 <p>In so far as the highest Self abides, for the purpose of devout meditation, in the heart of the devotee--which heart is of the measure of a thumb--it may itself be viewed as having the measure of a thumb. The individual soul also can be said to have the measure of a thumb only in so far as dwelling within the heart; for scripture directly states that its real size is that of the point of a goad, i.e. minute. And as men only are capable of devout meditation, and hence alone have a claim on scripture, the fact that the hearts of other living creatures also, such as donkeys, horses, snakes, &amp;c., have the same size, cannot give rise to any objection.--The discussion of this matter will be completed later on  <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="sbe48124.htm#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>
