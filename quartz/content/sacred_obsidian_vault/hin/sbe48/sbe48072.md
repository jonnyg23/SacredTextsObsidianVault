 <p>6. And on account of Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
 <p>'I dwell within the hearts of all, from me come memory and knowledge, as well as their loss'; 'He who free from delusion knows me to be the highest Person'; 'The Lord, O Ar<i>g</i>una, is seated in the heart of all Beings, driving round by his mysterious power all beings as if mounted on a machine; to him fly for refuge' (Bha. Gi. XV, 15, 19; XVIII, 61). These Sm<i>ri</i>ti-texts show the embodied soul to be the meditating subject, and the highest Self the object of meditation.</p>
