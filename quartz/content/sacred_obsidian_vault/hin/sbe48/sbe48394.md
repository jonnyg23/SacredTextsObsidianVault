 <p>10. On account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.</p>
 <p>The <i>Kh</i>ândogya and the Va<i>g</i>asaneyaka alike record a meditation on Pra<i>n</i>a; the object of meditation being Pra<i>n</i>a as possessing the qualities of being the oldest and the best, and also as possessing certain other qualities such as being the richest, and so on (<i>Kh</i>. Up. V, 1; B<i>ri</i>. Up. VI, 1). In the text of the Kaushîtakins, on the other hand, there is a meditation on Prâ<i>n</i>a which mentions the former qualities ('being the best' and 'being the oldest'), but not the latter ('being the richest,' and so on). This,the Pûrvapakshin maintains, constitutes a difference between the objects of meditation, and hence between the meditations themselves.--This view the Sûtra sets aside 'on account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.' There is no difference of meditation. Those qualities, viz. being the richest, and so on, are to be meditated upon in the other place also, viz. in the meditation on Prâ<i>n</i>a of the Kaushîtakins; 'since there is non-difference of everything,' i.e. since the text of the Kaushîtakins also exhibits the very same method, in all its details, for proving what it is undertaken to prove, viz. that Prâ<i>n</i>a is the oldest and best. And for that proof it is required that Prâ<i>n</i>a should be viewed as possessing also the quality of being the richest, and so on, and these qualities therefore have to be comprised in the meditation of the Kaushîtakins also. Hence there is no difference of meditation.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'non-difference of everything.'</p>
 <p>In the same way as the meditation on Prâ<i>n</i>a as the</p>
 <p><a name="page_637"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 637</font></a></p>
 <p>oldest and best cannot be accomplished without Prâ<i>n</i>a being also meditated upon as the richest, and so on. and as hence these latter qualities have to be comprised in the meditation on Prâ<i>n</i>a of the Kaushîtakins, although they are not expressly mentioned there; thus those qualities of Brahman also, without which the meditation on Brahman cannot be accomplished, must be included in all meditations on Brahman--this is the point to be proved next.</p>
