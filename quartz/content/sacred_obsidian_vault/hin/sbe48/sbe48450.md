 <p>3. On account of (such) conduct being seen.</p>
 <p>It is seen, viz in Scripture, that those who knew Brahman busied themselves chiefly with sacrifices.--A<i>s</i>vapati Kaikeya had a deep knowledge of the Self; but when three <i>Ri</i>shis had come to him to receive instruction regarding the Self, he told them 'I am about, to perform a sacrifice, Sirs' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from Sm<i>ri</i>ti that <i>G</i>anaka and other princes deeply versed in the knowledge of Brahman applied themselves to sacrificial works, 'By works only <i>G</i>anaka and others attained to perfection'; 'He also, well founded in knowledge, offered many sacrifices.' And this fact--that those who know Brahman apply themselves to works chiefly--shows that knowledge (or meditation) has no independent value, but serves to set forth the true nature of the active Self, and thus is subordinate to work.--An even more direct proof is set forth in the next Sûtra.</p>
