 <p>9. On the passing away of the effected (world of Brahma), together with its ruler, (the souls go) to what is higher than that; on account of scriptural declaration.</p>
 <p>On the passing away of the effected world of Brahma, together with its ruler Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha, who then recognises his qualification for higher knowledge, the soul also which had gone to Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha attains to true knowledge and thus reaches Brahman, which is higher than that,</p>

 <p>i.e. higher than the effected world of Brahmâ. This is known from the texts declaring that he who proceeds on the path of light reaches immortality and does not return; and is further confirmed by the text, 'They all, reaching the highest immortality, become free in the world of Brahman (Brahmâ) at the time of the great end ' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6).</p>
