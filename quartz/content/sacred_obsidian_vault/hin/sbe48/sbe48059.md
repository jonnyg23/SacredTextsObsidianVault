 <p>26. If it be objected that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the metre being denoted; (we reply) not so, because thus the direction of the mind (on Brahman) is declared; for thus it is seen.</p>
 <p>The previous section at first refers to the metre called Gâyatrî, 'The Gâyatrî indeed is everything' (III, 12, 1), and then introduces--with the words 'this is also declared by a <i>Rik</i> verse'--the verse, 'Such is the greatness of it (viz. the Gâyatrî),' &amp;c. Now, as this verse also refers to the metre, there is not any reference to the highest Person.--To this objection the second part of the Sûtra replies. The word 'Gâyatrî' does not here denote the metre only, since this cannot possibly be the Self of all; but the text declares the application of the idea of Gâyatrî to Brahman, i.e. teaches, to the end of a certain result being obtained, meditation on Brahman in so far as similar to Gâyatrî. For Brahman having four feet, in the sense indicated by the <i>rik</i>, may be compared to the Gâyatrî with its four (metrical) feet. The Gâyatrî (indeed has as a rule three feet, but) occasionally a Gâyatrî with four feet is met with; so, e.g., 'Indra<i>s</i> <i>s</i>a<i>k</i>îpati<i>h</i> | valena pî<i>d</i>ita<i>h</i> | du<i>sk</i>yavano v<i>ri</i>shâ | samitsu sâsahi<i>h</i>.' We see that in other passages also words primarily denoting metres are employed in other senses; thus, e.g., in the sa<i>m</i>vargavidyâ (<i>Kh</i>. Up. IV, 3, 8), where Virâ<i>g</i> (the name of a metre of ten syllables) denotes a group of ten divine beings.</p>

 <p>For this conclusion the next Sûtra supplies a further argument.</p>
