Such works as the Agnihotra must be performed, since there is no possibility of their results not clinging; for him who knows, those works have knowledge for their exclusive effect. This we learn from Scripture itself: 'Him Brâhma<i>n</i>as seek to know by the study of the Veda, by sacrifices, gifts, austerities, and fasting.'
