 <p>11. The presence, <i>G</i>aimini holds; because the text declares manifoldness.</p>
 <p>The teacher <i>G</i>aimini holds that the Released one has a body and senses; because the text declares manifoldness--'He is onefold, he is threefold, he is fivefold, he is sevenfold' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VII, 26, 2). The Self which is one and indivisible cannot be manifold, and the various forms of manifoldness of which the text speaks therefore must depend on the body. The text which speaks of the absence of a body refers to the absence of that body only which is due to Karman; for this latter body only is the cause of pleasure and pain. Next the Reverend Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a decides this point by the declaration of his own view.</p>
