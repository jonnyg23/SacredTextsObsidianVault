 <p>21. For both also speak of it as something different.</p>
 <p>Both, i.e. the Mâdhyandinas as well as the Kâ<i>n</i>vas, distinguish in their texts the embodied soul, together with speech and other non-intelligent things, from the Ruler within, representing it as an object of his rule. The Mâdhyandinas read, 'He who dwells in the Self, whom the Self does not know,' &amp;c.; the Kâ<i>n</i>vas, 'He who dwells</p>

 <p>within understanding', &amp;c. The declaration of the individual Self being ruled by the Ruler within implies of course the declaration of the former being different from the latter.</p>
 <p>The conclusion from all this is that the Ruler within is a being different from the individual soul, viz. the highest Self free from all evil, Nârâya<i>n</i>a.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'the internal Ruler'.</p>
