 <a href="sbe48004.htm">1. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48005.htm">The Small Pûrvapaksha</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48006.htm">The Small Siddhânta</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48007.htm">The Great Pûrvapaksha</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48008.htm">The Great Siddhânta.</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48009.htm">There is no proof of non-differenced substance</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48010.htm">Sabda proves difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48011.htm">Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48012.htm">The bhedâbheda view is untenable</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48013.htm">Inference also teaches difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48014.htm">Perception does not reveal mere being</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48015.htm">Plurality is not unreal</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48016.htm">Being and consciousness are not one</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48017.htm">The true meaning of Svayamprakâsatva</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48018.htm">Consciousness is not eternal</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48019.htm">There is no consciousness without object</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48020.htm">Consciousness is capable of change</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48021.htm">Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious self</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48022.htm">The view that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the ahamkâra, cannot be maintained</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48023.htm">The conscious subject persists in deep sleep</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48024.htm">The conscious subject persists in the state of release</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48025.htm">In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not stronger. The True cannot be known through the Untrue</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48026.htm">No scriptural texts teach a Brahman devoid of all difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48027.htm">Nor do Smriti and Purâna teach such a doctrine</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48028.htm">The theory of Nescience cannot be proved</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48029.htm">All knowledge is of the Real</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48030.htm">Neither Scripture nor Smriti and Purâna teach Nescience</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48031.htm"> Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a non-qualified Brahman.--the meaning of 'tat tvam asi.'</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48032.htm">Summary statement as to the way in which different scriptural texts are to reconciled</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48033.htm">Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman as the universal self</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48034.htm">The Vedântin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from Scripture,...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48035.htm">2. Brahman is that from which the origin of this world proceed</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48036.htm">3. Because Scripture is the source of the knowledge of Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48037.htm">4. The connexion of Scripture with the highest aim of man</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48038.htm">5. Seeing that which is not founded on Scripture...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48039.htm">6. ...the word 'seeing' has a secondary (figurative) meaning</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48040.htm">7. Because release is taught of him who takes his stand on it</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48041.htm">8. And because there is no statement of its having to be set aside</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48042.htm">9. And on account of the contradiction of the initial statement</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48043.htm">10. On account of (the individual soul) going to the Self</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48044.htm">11. On account of the uniformity of view</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48045.htm">12. And because it is directly stated in Scripture</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48046.htm">13. The Self consisting of Bliss is the highest Self on account of multiplication</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48047.htm">14. If, on account of its being a word denoting an effect...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48048.htm">15. And because he is declared to be the cause of thatra</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48049.htm">16. And because that (Brahman) which is referred to in the mantra...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48050.htm">17. Not the other, on account of impossibility</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48051.htm">18. And on account of the declaration of difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48052.htm">19. And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is inferred</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48053.htm">20. And Scripture teaches the joining of this with that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48054.htm">21. The one within the sun and the eye...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48055.htm">22. And on account of the declaration of difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48056.htm">23. Ether is Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48057.htm">24. For the same reason breath is Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48058.htm">25. The light is Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48059.htm">26. If it be objected that Brahman is not denoted...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48060.htm">27. And thus also, because thus only the designation of the beings...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48061.htm">28. If it be said that Brahman is not recognised...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48062.htm">29. Prâna is Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48063.htm">30. If it be said that Brahman is not denoted...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48064.htm">31. The instruction given by Indra about himself...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48065.htm">32. If it be said that Brahman is not meant...</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Second Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48066.htm">Second Pâda</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48067.htm">1. Everywhere; because there is taught what is known</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48068.htm">2. And because the qualities meant to be stated are possible in Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48069.htm">3. But, on account of impossibility, not the embodied soul</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48070.htm">4. And because there is (separate) denotation of the object and the agent</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48071.htm">5. On account of the difference of words</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48072.htm">6. And on account of Smriti</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48073.htm">7. Should it be said that the passage does not refer to Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48074.htm">8. Should it be said that there is attainment of fruition...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48075.htm">9. The eater is the highest Self on account of there being taken all that is movable and immovable</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48076.htm">10. And on account of the topic of the whole section</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48077.htm">11. The two entered into the cave...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48078.htm">12. And on account of distinctive qualities</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48079.htm">13. The Person within the eye is the highest Self...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48080.htm">14. And on account of the statement as to abode...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48081.htm">15. And on account of the text referring only to what is characterised by pleasure</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48082.htm">16. For that very reason that ether is Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48083.htm">17. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the Upanishads</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48084.htm">18. Not any other, on account of non-permanency of abode, and of impossibility</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48085.htm">19. The internal Ruler ... is the highest Self</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48086.htm">20. And not that which Smriti assumes...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48087.htm">21. For both also speak of it as something different</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48088.htm">22. That which possesses the qualities of invisibility...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48089.htm">23. Not the two others, on account of distinction and statement of difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48090.htm">24. And on account of the description of its form</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48091.htm">25. Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the highest Self...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48092.htm">26. That which the text refers to is an inferential mark--thus</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48093.htm">27. Should it be said that it is not so, on account of the word...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48094.htm">28. For the same reasons not the divinity and the element</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48095.htm">29. Gaimini thinks that there is no objection to the word 'Agni'...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48096.htm">30. On account of definiteness; thus Âsmarathya opines</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48097.htm">31. On account of meditation, Bâdari thinks</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48098.htm">32. On account of imaginative identification, thus Gaimini thinks...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48099.htm">33. Moreover, they record him in that</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Third Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48100.htm">Third Pâda: 1. The abode of heaven, earth is the highest Self...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48101.htm">2. And on account of its being declared that to which the released have to resort</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48102.htm">3. Not that which is inferred...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48103.htm">4. On account of the declaration of difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48104.htm">5. On account of the subject-matter</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48105.htm">6. And on account of abiding and eating</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48106.htm">7. The bhûman is the highest Self</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48107.htm">8. And on account of the suitability of the attributes</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48108.htm">9. The Imperishable is Brahman, on account of its supporting that which is the end of ether</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48109.htm">10. And this supporting springs from command...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48110.htm">11. And on account of the exclusion of what is of another nature than Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48111.htm">12. On account of his being designated as the object of seeing, the highest Self is that object</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48112.htm">13. The small ether is Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48113.htm">14. On account of the going and of the word...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48114.htm">15. And on account of there being observed in that small ether...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48115.htm">16. And on account of the settled meaning</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48116.htm">17. If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is meant; we say no...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48117.htm">18. ... the soul in so far as its true nature has become manifest</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48118.htm">19. And the reference has a different meaning</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48119.htm">20. If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of smallness...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48120.htm">21. And on account of the imitation of that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48121.htm">22. The same is declared by Smriti also</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48122.htm">23. On account of the term, the one measured</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48123.htm">24. But with reference to the heart, men being qualified</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48124.htm">25. Also beings above them, i.e. men...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48125.htm">26. If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny this</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48126.htm">27. If it be said that a contradiction will result with regard to words...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48127.htm">28. And for this very reason eternity of the Veda</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48128.htm">29. And on account of the equality of names and forms there is no contradiction...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48129.htm">30. On account of the impossibility of qualification...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48130.htm">31. And on account of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the Light</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48131.htm">33. That grief of him arose...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48132.htm">34. And on account of Gâna<i>s</i>ruti kshattriya-hood being understood</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48133.htm">35. On account of the inferential sign further on...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48134.htm">36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48135.htm">37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-being of that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48136.htm">38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance of (Vedic) matter</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48137.htm">39. And on account of Smriti</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48138.htm">40. On account of the trembling</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48139.htm">41. On account of light being seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48140.htm">42. The ether, on account of the designation of something different, and so on</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48141.htm">43. On account of difference in deep sleep and departing</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48142.htm">44. And on account of such words as Lord</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Fourth Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48143.htm">Fourth Pâda: 1. If it be said that some mention that which rests on Inference ...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48144.htm">2. But the subtle body, on account of its capability</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48145.htm">3. Matter in its subtle state subserves an end...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48146.htm">4. And on account of there being no statement of its being an object of knowledge</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48147.htm">5. ... the intelligent Self is meant...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48148.htm">6. And of three only there is this mention and question</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48149.htm">7. And as in the case of the 'Great.'</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48150.htm">8. On account of there being no special characteristic; as in the case of the cup</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48151.htm">9. But she begins with light; for thus some read in their text</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48152.htm">10. And on account of the teaching of formation ... there is no contradiction; as in the case of the honey</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48153.htm">11. Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the diversity and of the excess</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48154.htm">12. The breath, and so on, on the ground of the complementary passage</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48155.htm">13. By light, food not being mentioned in the text of some</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48156.htm">14. And on account of Brahman as described being declared to be the cause with regard to Ether, and so on</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48157.htm">15. From connexion</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48158.htm">16. Because it denotes the world</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48159.htm">17....the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48160.htm">18. But Gaimini thinks that it has another purport...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48161.htm">19. On account of the connected meaning of the sentences</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48162.htm">20. It is a mark indicating that the promissory statement is proved...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48163.htm">21. Because (the soul) when it will depart is such; thus Audulomi thinks</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48164.htm">22. On account of Brahman's abiding within the individual soul...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48165.htm">23. Brahman is the material cause...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48166.htm">24. And on account of the statement of reflection</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48167.htm">25. And on account of both being directly declared</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48168.htm">26. On account of the Self making itself</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48169.htm">27. Owing to modification</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48170.htm">28. And because it is called the womb</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48171.htm">29. Herewith all (texts) are explained, explained</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Second Adyaya</h3>
 
 <a name="section_006"></a>
 <h3 align="CENTER">First Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48172.htm">First Pâda: 1. ... want of room for other Smritis</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48173.htm">2. And on account of the non-perception of truth on the part of others</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48174.htm">3. Hereby the Yoga is refuted</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48175.htm">4. Not, on account of the difference of character of that; and its being such (appears) from Scripture</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48176.htm">5. But there is denotation of the superintending deities, on account of distinction and entering</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48177.htm">7. If it be said that the effect is non-existing; we say no</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48178.htm">8. On account of such consequences in reabsorption the Vedânta-texts would be inappropriate</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48179.htm">9. Not so; as there are parallel instances</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48180.htm">10. And on account of the objections to his view</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48181.htm">11. Also in consequence of the ill-foundedness of reasoning</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48182.htm">12. Should it be said that inference is to be carried on in a different way...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48183.htm">13. Thereby also the remaining theories which are not comprised within the Veda are explained</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48184.htm">14. If it be said that from Brahman becoming an enjoyer...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48185.htm">15. The non-difference of the world from that Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48186.htm">16. And because (the cause) is perceived in the existence of the effect</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48187.htm">17. And on account of the existence of that which is posterior</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48188.htm">19. And like a piece of cloth</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48189.htm">20. And as the different vital airs</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48190.htm">21. From the designation of the 'other' as non-different from Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48191.htm">22. But Brahman is additional, on account of the declaration of difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48192.htm">23. And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is impossibility of that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48193.htm">24. ... as in the case of milk</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48194.htm">25. And as in the case of the gods...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48195.htm">26. Or the consequence of the entire Brahman entering into the effect...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48196.htm">27. But on account of Scripture; Brahman's possession of various powers being founded upon the word</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48197.htm">28. And thus in the Self; for there are manifold powers</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48198.htm">29. And on account of the defects of his view also</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48199.htm">30. And the divinity is endowed with all powers, because that is seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48200.htm">31. Not, on account of the absence of organs...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48201.htm">32. Brahman is not the cause; on account of the world having the nature of what depends on a motive</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48202.htm">33. But it is mere sport, as in ordinary life</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48203.htm">34. Not inequality and cruelty...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48204.htm">35. If it be said 'not so, on account of non-distinction of deeds'...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48205.htm">36. And because all the attributes are proved to be present in Brahman</a><br>
 
 <a name="section_007"></a>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Second Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48206.htm">Second Pâda: 1. Not that which is inferred, on account of the impossibility of construction, and on account of activity</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48207.htm">2. If it be said--like milk or water; there also intelligence guides</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48208.htm">3. And because from the independence of the Pradhâna there would follow the non-existence of what is different from creation</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48209.htm">4. Nor like grass and so on; because milk does not exist elsewhere</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48210.htm">5. And if you say--as the man and the stone; thus also</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48211.htm">6. And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal and subordinate matter</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48212.htm">7. And if another inference be made the result remains unchanged...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48213.htm">8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48214.htm">9. And it is objectionable on account of the contradictions</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48215.htm">10. Or in the same way as the big and long from the short and the atomic</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48216.htm">11. On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being of the origination of the world</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48217.htm">12. And because owing to the acknowledgment of samavâya, there results a regressus in infinitum from equality</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48218.htm">13. And because the world also would thus be eternal</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48219.htm">14. And on account of the atoms having colour</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48220.htm">15. And as there are objections in both cases</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48221.htm">16. And as it is not accepted, it is altogether disregarded</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48222.htm">17. Even on the aggregate with its two causes...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48223.htm">18. If it be said that this is to be explained through successive causality...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48224.htm">19. And on account of the cessation of the preceding...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48225.htm">20. There not being a cause, there results contradiction...</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48345.htm">Second Pâda: 1. In the intermediate sphere the creation is effected by the soul</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48346.htm">2. And some state the soul to be the shaper...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48347.htm">3. But it is mere Mâyâ; on account of the true nature of the soul not being fully manifested</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48348.htm">4. But owing to the wish of the highest it is hidden; for from that are its bondage and the opposite state</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48349.htm">5. Or that (results) also from connexion with the body</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48350.htm">6. And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also declare</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48351.htm">7. The absence of that takes place in the nâdîs and in the Self</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48352.htm">8. Hence the awaking from that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48353.htm">9. But the same, on account of work, remembrance, text, and injunction</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48354.htm">10. In the swooning person there is half-combination...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48355.htm">11. Not on account of place even is there any imperfection of the Highest; for everywhere it is described as having twofold characteristics</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48356.htm">12. Should it be said 'on account of difference'...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48357.htm">13. Some also teach thus</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48358.htm">14. For Brahman is without form merely, since it is the principal agent with regard to that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48359.htm">15. And in the same way as a Brahman consisting of light; the texts thus not being devoid of meaning</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48360.htm">16. And the text says so much only</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48361.htm">17. This Scripture also shows, and it is also stated in Smriti</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48362.htm">18. For this very reason comparisons, such as reflected images of the sun and the like</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48363.htm">19. But because it is not apprehended like water, there is no equality</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48364.htm">20. The participation on Brahman's part in increase and decrease...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48365.htm">21. For the text denies the previously declared so-muchness; and declares more than that</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48366.htm">22. That is unmanifested; for this Scripture declares</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48367.htm">23. Also in perfect conciliation, according to Scripture and Smriti</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48368.htm">24. And there is non-difference...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48369.htm">25. Hence (Brahman is distinguished) by what is infinite...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48370.htm">26. But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its coils</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48372.htm">28. Or else in the manner stated above</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48373.htm">29. And on account of denial</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48375.htm">31. But on account of resemblance</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48376.htm">32. It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the case of the feet</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48377.htm">33. Owing to difference of place, as in the case of light, and so on</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48378.htm">34. And on account of possibility</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48379.htm">35. Thus, from the denial of anything else</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48380.htm">36. The omnipresence possessed by that, understood from the declaration of extent</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48381.htm">37. From thence the reward; on account of possibility</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48382.htm">38. And on account of scriptural declaration</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48383.htm">39. For the same reasons <i>G</i>aimini (thinks it to be) religious action</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48386.htm">2. If it be said that the vidyâs are not one on account of difference...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48387.htm">3. For the sirovrata concerns the mode of the study of the Veda...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48388.htm">4. Scripture also declares this</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48389.htm">5. (Meditation) thus being equal, there is combination of gunas</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48390.htm">6. If it be said that there is difference on account of the text; we say no; on account of non-difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48391.htm">7. Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case of the attribute of being higher than the high</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48392.htm">8. If that be declared on account of name; we object</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48393.htm">9. And this is appropriate, on account of the extension</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48394.htm">10. On account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48395.htm">11. Bliss and other qualities, as belonging to the subject of the qualities</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48396.htm">12. Such qualities as having joy for its head, and so on, are not established...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48397.htm">13. But the others, on account of equality with the thing</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48398.htm">14. For meditation, owing to the absence of purpose</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48399.htm">15. And on account of the term 'Self.'</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48400.htm">16. There is reference to the Self, as in other places...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48401.htm">17. If it be said 'on account of connexion'...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48402.htm">18. The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what has to be done</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48403.htm">19. And (the qualities) thus being equal, on account of non-difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48404.htm">20. On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48405.htm">21. Or not so, on account of difference</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48406.htm">22. The text also declares this</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48407.htm">23. And for the same reason the holding together and the pervading the sky</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48408.htm">24. And although they both be meditations on man...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48409.htm">25. On account of the difference of sense of piercing...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48410.htm">26. But in the case of the getting rid of it has to be combined with the obtaining...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48411.htm">27. At departing; there being nothing to be reached...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48412.htm">28. As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of either</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48413.htm">29. There is meaning of the soul's going only on the twofold hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradiction</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48414.htm">30. That assumption is justified; on account of the perception of things which are marks of that; as in ordinary experience</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48415.htm">31. Of those who have a certain office there is subsistence (of their works) as long as the office lasts</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48416.htm">32. There is no restriction since all have to go on that path</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48417.htm">33. But the conceptions of the Imperishable are to be comprised in all meditations</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48418.htm">34. So much; on account of reflection</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48419.htm">35. Should it be said that the former reply refers to that Self to which the aggregate of material things belongs...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48420.htm">36. There is interchange of ideas, for the texts distinguish; as in other cases</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48421.htm">37. For one and the same highest divinity ... is the subject of that meditation</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48424.htm">40. In the case of him who has approached Brahman...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48425.htm">41. There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen; for there is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48426.htm">42. Just as in the case of the offerings...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48427.htm">43. On account of the plurality of indicatory marks...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48428.htm">44. There is option with regard to what precedes...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48429.htm">45. And on account of the transfer</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48430.htm">46. But it is a meditation only, on account of assertion and what is seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48431.htm">47. And on account of the greater strength of direct statement, and so on, there is no refutation</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48432.htm">48. On account of connexions and the rest, as in the case of the separateness of other cognitions</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48433.htm">49. Not so, on account of this being observed on account of similarity also; as in the case of Death; for the person in yonder orb does not occupy the worlds of Death</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48434.htm">50. And by a subsequent Brâhmana also the 'being of such a kind' of the word is proved...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48435.htm">51. Some, on account of the existence of a Self within a body</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48436.htm">52. But this is not so, but rather difference; since it is of the being of that; as in the case of intuition</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48437.htm">53. But those meditations which are connected with members of sacrifices are not restricted to particular sâkhâs, but rather belong to all sâkhâs</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48438.htm">54. Or there is no contradiction as in the case of mantras and the rest</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48439.htm">55. There is pre-eminence of plenitude, as in the case of the sacrifice; for thus Scripture shows</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48440.htm">56. The meditations are separate, on account of the difference of words, and so on</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48441.htm">57. Option, on account of the non-difference of result</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48453.htm">6. On account of injunction for such a one</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48454.htm">7. On account of definite rule</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48455.htm">8. But on account of the teaching of the different one...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48456.htm">9. But the declarations are equal.</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48457.htm">10. (It is) non-comprehensive</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48458.htm">11. There is distribution, as in the case of the hundred</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48459.htm">12. Of him who has merely read the Veda</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48460.htm">13. Not so, on account of non-specification</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48461.htm">14. Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48462.htm">15. Some also, by proceeding according to their liking</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48463.htm">16. And destruction</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48464.htm">17. And of him who is chaste...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48465.htm">18. A reference only ... on account of absence of injunction</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48466.htm">19. It is to be accomplished, ... on account of scriptural statement of equality</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48467.htm">20. Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48468.htm">21. If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their reference; not so, on account of the newness</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48469.htm">22. And on account of the words denoting becoming</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48470.htm">23. .. the stories told in the Upanishads ...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48471.htm">24. This follows also from the textual connexion of those stories with injunctions</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48472.htm">25. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the fire...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48473.htm">26. And there is need of all works...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48474.htm">27. But all the same he must be possessed of calmness...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48475.htm">28. And there is permission of all food in the case of danger of life ...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48476.htm">29. And on account of non-sublation</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48477.htm">30. This is said in Smriti also</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48478.htm">31. ... as to non-proceeding according to liking</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48479.htm">32. The works of the â<i>s</i>ramas ...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48480.htm">33. And on account of co-operativeness</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48481.htm">34. In any case they are the same, on account of twofold inferential signs</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48482.htm">35. ... knowledge not to be overpowered</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48483.htm">36. Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48484.htm">37. Smriti also states this</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48485.htm">38. And there is the promotion of knowledge through special acts of duty</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48486.htm">39. But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential mark</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48487.htm">40. But of him who has become that there is no becoming not that...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48488.htm">41. Nor the expiatory performance...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48489.htm">42. A minor one, thus some; and hence they hold the existence of expiation, as in the case of eating.</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48490.htm">43. But in either case such men stand outside...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48491.htm">45. They are the priest's work...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48492.htm">46. There is injunction of other auxiliary means...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48493.htm">47. But on account of the existence of knowledge in all, there is winding up with the householder</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48494.htm">48. On account of the others also being taught...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48495.htm">49. Not manifesting itself; on account of the connexion</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48496.htm">50. What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as this is seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48497.htm">51. In the same way there is non-determination...</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">First Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48498.htm">First Pâda: 1. Repetition...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48499.htm">2. And on account of an inferential mark</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48500.htm">3. But as the Self...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48501.htm">4. Not in the symbol...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48502.htm">5. The view of Brahman, on account of superiority</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48503.htm">6. And the ideas of Âditya and the rest on the member</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48504.htm">7. Sitting; on account of possibility</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48505.htm">8. And on account of meditation</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48506.htm">9. And with reference to immobility</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48507.htm">10. And Sm<i>ri</i>ti texts say the same</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48508.htm">11. Where concentration of mind is possible...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48509.htm">12. Up to death; for there also it is seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48510.htm">13. On the attainment of this, there result the non-clinging and the destruction of later and earlier sins</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48511.htm">14. Of the other also there is thus non-clinging; but at death</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48512.htm">15. But only those former works the effects of which have not yet begun...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48513.htm">16. But the Agnihotra and the rest...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48514.htm">17. According to some a class of good works other than these, of both kinds</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Second Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48517.htm">Second Pâda: 1. Speech with mind...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48518.htm">2. And for the same reason all follow after</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48519.htm">3. That mind in breath...</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48525.htm">9. And the subtle body persists</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48526.htm">10. Hence not in the way of destruction of bondage</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48527.htm">11. And to that very subtle body there belongs the warmth</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48528.htm">12. ... From the embodied soul...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48529.htm">13. Smriti also declares this</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48546.htm">10. And on account of Smriti</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48547.htm">11. The Highest ... on account of primariness of meaning</a><br>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Fourth Pâda</h3>
 <a href="sbe48552.htm">Fourth Pâda: 1. On the soul's having approached the highest light there is manifestation</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48553.htm">2. The released one; on account of the promise</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48554.htm">3. The Self, on account of subject-matter</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48555.htm">4. In non-division; because that is seen</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48556.htm">5. In a nature like that of Brahman</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48557.htm">6. In the sole nature of intelligence; as that is its Self...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48558.htm">7. Thus also, on account of existence of the former qualities as proved by suggestion, Bâdarayana holds absence of contradiction</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48559.htm">8. By the mere will...</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48562.htm">11. The presence...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48563.htm">12. For this reason Bâdarâyana holds him to be of both kinds; as in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48565.htm">14. When there is a body, as in the waking state</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48566.htm">15. The entering is as in the case of a lamp</a><br>

 <a href="sbe48568.htm">17. With the exception of world-energy...</a><br>
 <a href="sbe48569.htm">18. ... that which abides within the spheres of those entrusted with special functions</a><br>
