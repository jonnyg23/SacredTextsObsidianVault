 <p>25. On account of the difference of sense of piercing and so on.</p>
 <p>The text of the Âtharva<i>n</i>ikas exhibits at the beginning of their Upanishad some mantras, 'Pierce the <i>s</i>ukra, pierce the heart.' The followers of the Sâma-veda read at the beginning of their rahasya-brâhma<i>n</i>a 'O God Savit<i>ri</i>, promote the sacrifice.' The Kâ<i>th</i>akas and the Taittirîyakas have 'May Mitra be propitious to us, may Varu<i>n</i>a be propitious.' The Sâ<i>t</i>yâyanins have 'Thou art a white horse, a tawny and a black one!' The Kaushîtakins have a Brâhma<i>n</i>a referring to the Mahavrata-ceremony, 'Indra having slain V<i>ri</i>tra became great.' The Kaushîtakins also have a Mahâvrata-brâhma<i>n</i>a. 'Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year; his Self is that Mahâvrata.' The Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyins have a Brâhma<i>n</i>a referring to the Pravargya, 'The gods sat</p>

 <p>down for a sattra-celebration.' With reference to all this a doubt arises whether these mantras and the sacrificial works referred to in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a texts form parts of the meditations enjoined in the Upanishads or not.--The Pûrvapakshin affirms this, on the ground that as the mantras and works are mentioned in the immediate neighbourhood of the meditations the idea of their forming parts of the latter naturally presents itself. Such mantras as 'pierce the heart' and works such as the pravargya may indeed--on the basis of direct statement (<i>s</i>ruti), inferential mark (linga), and syntactical connexion (vâkya), which are stronger than mere proximity--be understood to be connected with certain actions; but, on the other hand, mantras such as 'May Varu<i>n</i>a be propitious' have no application elsewhere, and are suitable introductions to meditations. We therefore take them to be parts of the meditations, and hence hold that those mantras are to be included in all meditations.--This view the Sûtra sets aside 'on account of the difference of sense of piercing, and so on.' The inferential marks contained in texts such as 'pierce the <i>s</i>ukra, pierce the heart'; 'I shall speak the right, I shall speak the true,' show that the mantras have an application in connexion with certain magical practices, or else the study of the Veda, and the like, and do not therefore form part of meditations. That is to say--in the same way as the mantra 'pierce the heart' enables us to infer that also the mantra 'pierce the <i>s</i>ukra' belongs to some magical rite, so we infer from the special meaning of mantras such as 'I shall speak the right,' &amp;c., that also mantras such as 'May Mitra be propitious' are connected with the study of the Veda, and do not therefore form part of meditations. That mantras of this kind and Brâhma<i>n</i>a passages relative to the Pravargya and the like are placed at the beginning of Upanishads is owing to their having, like the latter, to be studied in the forest.--Herewith terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'piercing and the like.'</p>
