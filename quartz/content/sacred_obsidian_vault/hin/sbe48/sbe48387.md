 <p>3. For (the <i>s</i>irovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda; also on account of (that rite) being a heading in the samâ<i>k</i>âra; and the restriction is like that of the libations.</p>
 <p>What the text says as to a restriction connected with the 'vow of the head,' does not intimate a difference of vidyâs. For that vow does not form part of the vidyâ. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of the <i>study</i> of the Veda on the part of the Âtharva<i>n</i>ikas, being meant to establish that they should possess that special qualification which the rite produces; but it does not affect the vidyâ itself. This is proved by the subsequent clause, 'a man who has not performed that rite may not <i>read</i> the text,' which directly connects the rite with the studying of the text. And it is further proved by the fact that in the book of the Âtharva<i>n</i>ikas, called 'sâmâ<i>k</i>ara, 'that rite is referred to as a rite connected with the Veda (not with the special vidyâ set forth in the Mu<i>nd</i>aka), viz. in the passage, 'this is explained already by the Veda-observance' (which extends the details of the <i>s</i>irovrata, there called veda-vrata, to other observances). By the <i>knowledge of Brahman</i> (referred to in the Mu<i>nd</i>aka-text 'let a man tell this science of Brahman to those only,' &amp;c.), we have therefore to understand knowledge of the Veda in general. And that restriction is 'like that of the libations'--i.e. it is analogous to the restriction under which the sava-libations, beginning with the Saptasûrya-libation, and terminating with the <i>S</i>ataudana-libation, are offered in the one fire which is used by the followers of the Atharvan, and not in the ordinary three fires.</p>
