 <p>6. (Him who meditates on) the effected Brahman, (thus opines) Bâdari; because for him going is possible.</p>
 <p>The following question now presents itself for consideration. Does the troop of conducting divinities, Agni and the rest, lead on those who meditate on the effected Brahman, i.e. Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha; or those only who meditate on the highest Brahman; or those who meditate on the highest Brahman and those who meditate on the individual Self as having Brahman for its Self?--The teacher Bâdari is of opinion that the divinities lead on those only who meditate on the effected Brahman. For he only who meditates on Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha can move; while a person meditating on the highest Brahman which is absolutely complete, all-knowing, present everywhere, the Self of all, cannot possibly be conceived as moving to some other place in order to reach Brahman; for him Brahman rather is something already reached. For him the effect of true knowledge is only to put an end to that Nescience which has for its object Brahman, which, in reality, is eternally reached. He, on the other hand,who meditates on Hira<i>n</i>yagarbha may be conceived as moving in ordfer to reach his object, which is something abiding within a special limited place. It is he therefore who is conducted on by Agni and the other escorting deities.</p>
