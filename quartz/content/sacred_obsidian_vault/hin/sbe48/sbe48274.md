 <p>Scripture even states quite directly that knowledge is something distinct from the knowing subject, viz. in the passage 'For there is not known any intermission of the knowing of the knower' (B<i>ri.</i> Up. IV, 3, 30).--It has been said that in passages such as 'he who abiding in knowledge' (B<i>ri.</i> Up. III, 7, 22); 'Knowledge performs the sacrifice' (Taitt. Up. II, 5, 1); 'having knowledge for its nature, absolutely free from stain,'Scripture speaks of the Self as being mere knowledge (not a knower). This point the next Sûtra elucidates.</p>
