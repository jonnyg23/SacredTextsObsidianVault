 <p>14. And on account of the statement as to abode, and so on.</p>
 <p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p>
 <p>Abiding within the eye, ruling the eye, and so on are predicated by scripture of the highest Self only, viz. in B<i>ri</i>. Up. III, 7, 18, 'He who dwells within the eye, who rules the eye within.' We therefore recognise that highest Self in the text, 'That Person which is seen within the eye.' The argument founded on reference to 'something well known' thus suits the highest Self very well; and also the clause which denotes immediate perception ('is seen') appears quite suitable, since the highest Self is directly intuited by persons practising mystic concentration of mind (Yoga).</p>
