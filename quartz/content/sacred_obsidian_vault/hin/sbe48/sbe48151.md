 <p>9. But she begins with light; for thus some read in their text.</p>
 <p>The 'but' has assertory force. 'Light' in the Sûtra means Brahman, in accordance with the meaning of the term as known from texts such as 'On him the gods meditate, the light of lights' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. X, 4, 16); 'That light which shines beyond heaven' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. III, 13, 7). 'She begins with light' thus means 'she has Brahman for her cause.'--'For thus some read in their text,' i.e. because the members of one <i>S</i>âkhâ, viz the Taittiriyas read in their</p>

 <p>text that this 'a<i>g</i>â' has Brahman for her cause. The Mahânârâya<i>n</i>a-Upanishad (of the Taittirîyas) at first refers to Brahman abiding in the hollow of the heart as the object of meditation. 'Smaller than the small, greater than the great, the Self placed in the hollow of this creature'; next declares that all the worlds and Brahma and the other gods originated from that Self; and then says that there sprung from it also this a<i>g</i>â which is the cause of all 'The one a<i>g</i>â (goat), red, white and black, which gives birth to numerous offspring of the same shape, one a<i>g</i>a (he-goat) loves and lies by her; another one forsakes her after having enjoyed her.' The subject-matter of the entire section evidently is to give instruction as to the whole aggregate of things other than Brahman originating from Brahman and thus having its Self in it; hence we conclude that also the a<i>g</i>â which gives birth to manifold creatures like her, and is enjoyed by the soul controlled by karman, while she is abandoned by the soul possessing true knowledge is, no less than vital airs, seas, mountains, &amp;c., a creature of Brahman, and hence has its Self in Brahman. We then apply to the interpretation of the <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatara-text the meaning of the analogous Mahânâraya<i>n</i>a-text, as determined by the complementary passages, and thus arrive at the conclusion that the a<i>g</i>â in the former text also is a being having its Self in Brahman. That this is so, moreover, appears from the <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatara itself. For in the early part of that Upanishad, we have after the introductory question, 'Is Brahman the cause?' the passage 'The sages devoted to meditation and concentration have seen the person whose Self is the divinity, hidden in its own qualities' (I, 1, 3); which evidently refers to the a<i>g</i>â. as being of the nature of a power of the highest Brahman. And as further on also (viz. in the passages 'From that the Mâyin creates all this, and in this the other is bound up through Mâya'; 'Know then Prak<i>ri</i>ti to be Mâyâ and the Great Lord the ruler of Mâyâ'; and 'he who rules every place of birth,' V, 9-11) the very same being is referred to, there remains not even a shadow of proof for the assertion that the mantra under discussion</p>
 <p><a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 368</font></a></p>
 <p>refers to an independent Prak<i>ri</i>ti as assumed by the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas.</p>
 <p>But a further objection is raised, if the Prak<i>ri</i>ti denoted by a<i>g</i>â begins with, i.e. is caused by Brahman, how can it be called a<i>g</i>â, i.e. the non-produced one; or, if it is non-produced, how can it be originated by Brahman? To this the next Sûtra replies.</p>
