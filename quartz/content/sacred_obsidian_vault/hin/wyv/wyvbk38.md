 <p>BY impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,<br> with the Hands of Pûshan.<br> A zone for Aditi art thou.<br> 2 Idâ, come hither. Aditi, come hither. Sarasvatî, come<br> hither.<br> Come hither, So-and-So. Come hither, So-and-So. Come<br> hither, So-and-So.<br> 3 Thou art a zone for Aditi, a diadem for Indrânî. Pûshan art<br> thou. Spare some for the Gharma.<br> 4 Overflow for the Asvins. Overflow for Sarasvatî. Overflow<br> for Indra<br> All-hail, what belongs to Indra! All-hail, what belongs to<br> Indra! All-hail, what belongs to Indra!<br> 5 That breast of thine, exhaustless, fount of pleasure, wealth-giver,<br> treasure-finder, free-bestower,<br> Wherewith thou rearest all things that are choicest,bring<br> that, Sarasvatî, that we may drain it.<br> Throughout the spacious middle air I travel.<br> 6 Thou art Gâyatra metre. Thou art Trishtup metre. With<br> Heaven and Earth I grasp thee. With the Firmament I<br> raise thee up.<br> Indra and Asvins, drink ye the hot draught of sweet honey:<br> sacrifice, ye Vasus. Vât! All-hail to the rain-winning<br> beam of the Sun!</p>

Overflow for energy. Overflow for the<br> Priesthood. Overflow for the Nobility. Overflow for<br> Heaven and Earth. Thou, O duteous one, art Duty.<br> Innocent one, in us establish manly powers; establish the<br> People.</p>

Do not thou injure me.<br> 17 Thy far-spread majesty, instinct with wisdom, hath<br> surpassed this heaven,<br> And, with its glorious fame, the earth.<br> Seat thee, for thou art mighty: shine, best entertainer of<br> the Gods.<br> Worthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke ruddy<br> and beautiful to see.<br> 18 Gharma, that heavenly light of thine in Gâyatrî, in the<br> Soma-store,<br> May it increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.<br> Gharma, that light of thine in air, in Trishtup, in the sacred<br> hearth,<br> May it increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.<br> Gharma, that light of thine on earth, in Jagatî, of the priest's<br> shed,<br> May that increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.<br> 19 Thee for the sure protection of the Nobles. Guard thou<br> from injury the Brahman's body.<br> We follow thee in interest of the People, for the renewal of<br> our peace and comfort.</p>

 <p>20 Square, far-spread is the sacrifice's navel: it spreads for us<br> wide, full of all existence, spreads wide for us full of<br> complete existence.<br> We turn against the hate and guiles of him who keeps an<br> alien law.<br> 21 This, Gharma! is thy liquid store. Swell out and wax in<br> strength thereby.<br> May we too grow in strength and wax to greatness.<br> 22 Loudly the tawny Stallion neighed, mighty, like Mitra fair to see.<br> Together with the Sun the sea, the store shone out with<br> flashing light.<br> 23 To us let Waters and let Plants be friendly; to him who<br> hates us, whom we hate, unfriendly.<br> 24 Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come<br> To Sûrya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent.<br> 25 A brand art thou, fain would we thrive, Fuel art thou, and<br> splendour: Give me splendour,<br> 26 Far as the heaven and earth are spread in compass, far as<br> the Seven Rivers are extended,<br> So vast thy cup which I with strength am taking, Indra,<br> unharmed in me, uninjured ever.<br> 27 In me be that great hero power, in me be strength and<br> mental force:<br> The Gharma shines with triple light, with lustre fulgent<br> far away, with holy lore, with brilliancy.<br> 28 Brought hither is the seed of milk. Through each succeeding<br> year may we enjoy the bliss of draining it.<br> Invited, I enjoy a share of that which hath been offered me,<br> the savoury draught by Indra drunk and tasted by Prajâpati.</p>
