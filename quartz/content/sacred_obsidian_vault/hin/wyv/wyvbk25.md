 <p>16 We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the<br> friendly Daksha, Mitra, Aditi,<br> Aryaman, Varuna, Soma, the Asvins. May Sarasvatî, auspicious,<br> grant felicity.<br> 17 May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth<br> our Mother give it, and our Father Heaven,<br> And the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. Asvins,<br> may ye, for whom our spirits long, hear this.<br> 18 Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all<br> that stands or moves, inspirer of the soul,<br> That Pûshan may promote the increase of our wealth, our<br> keeper and our guard infallible for our good.<br> 19 Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may Pûshan<br> prosper us, the Master of all wealth.<br> May Târkshya with uninjured fellies prosper us: Brihaspati<br> vouchsafe to us prosperity.<br> 20 The Maruts, Sons of Prisni, borne by spotted steeds, moving<br> in glory, oft visiting holy rites,<br> Sages whose tongue is Agni and their eyes the Sun,hither<br> let all the Gods for our protection come.<br> 21 Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with<br> our eyes see what is good, ye Holy Ones.<br> With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the<br> term of life appointed by the Gods.<br> 22 A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within<br> whose space ye bring our bodies to decay;<br> Within whose space our sons become fathers in turn.

 <p>Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath<br> been born and shall be born.<br> 24 Slight us not Varuna, Aryaman, or Mitra, Ribhukshan,<br> Indra, Âyu, or the Maruts,<br> When we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the<br> Strong Steed, God-descended.<br> 25 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with<br> trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation,<br> The dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the<br> place dear to Indra and to Pûshan.<br> 26 Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pûshan, is first led<br> forward with the vigorous Courser,<br> While Tvashtar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable<br> for sacrifice, to glory.<br> 27 When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who<br> goeth to the Gods as meet oblation,<br> The goat precedeth him, the share of Pûshan, and to the<br> Gods the sacrifice announceth.<br> 28 Invoker, ministering priest, stoner, fire-kindler, Soma-presser,<br> sage, reciter,<br> With this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full<br> the channels of the rivers.<br> 29 The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those<br> who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake;<br> Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,may<br> the approving help of these promote our work.<br> 30 Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his<br> smooth back is come; my prayer attends him.<br> In him rejoice the singer and the sages. A good friend<br> have we won for the Gods banquet.</p>

 <p>31 May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the headstall<br> and the girths and cords about him,<br> And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,among<br> the Gods, too, let all these be with thee.<br> 32 What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left<br> sticking to the post or hatchet,<br> Or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,among the<br> Gods, tog, may all this he with thee.<br> 33 Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of<br> raw flesh remaining,<br> This let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice<br> with perfect cooking.<br> 34 What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou<br> art set upon the spit, distilleth,<br> Let not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing<br> Gods let all be offered.<br> 35 They who, observing that the Horse is ready, call out and<br> say, The smell is good; remove it;<br> And, craving meat, await the distribution,may their<br> approving help promote our labour.<br> 36 The trial-fork of the flesh cooking caldron, the vessels out<br> of which the broth is sprinkled,<br> The warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks,<br> carving-boards,all these attend the Charger.<br> 37 Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor<br> glowing caldron smell and break to pieces.<br> Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,such Charger<br> do the Gods accept with favour.<br> 38 The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes<br> wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened,<br> The water that he drank, the food he tasted,among the<br> Gods, too, may all these attend thee.<br> 39 The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the<br> upper covering and the golden trappings,<br> The halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,all<br> these, as grateful to the Gods, they offer.<br> 40 If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his<br> heel or with his whip distressed thee,<br> All these thy woes, as with oblation's ladle at sacrifices,<br> with my prayer I banish.<br> 41 The four-and-thirty ribs of the swift Courser, kin to the<br> Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>Cut ye with skill so that the parts be flawless, and piece by<br> piece declaring them dissect them.<br> 42 Of Tvashtar's Courser there is one dissector: this is the<br> custom: two there are who guide him.<br> Such of his limbs as I divide in order, all these, amid the<br> lumps, in fire I offer.<br> 43 Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the<br> hatchet linger in thy body.<br> Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints,<br> mangle thy limbs unduly.<br> 44 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by easy<br> paths to Gods thou goest.<br> Both Bays, both Spotted Mares are now thy fellows, and to<br> the Ass's pole is yoked the Courser.<br> 45 May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in<br> good kine, good horses, manly offspring.<br> Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us; the Steed with<br> our oblations gain us lordship!<br> 46 We will, with Indra and all Gods to help us, bring these<br> existing worlds into subjection.<br> With the Âdityas, with the band of Maruts, may Indra<br> give us medicine to heal us.<br> Our sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspring may Indra<br> regulate with the Âdityas.<br> 47 O Agni, be our nearest Friend, etc., as in III. 25.<br> To thee then, O Most Bright, etc., as in III. 26.</p>
