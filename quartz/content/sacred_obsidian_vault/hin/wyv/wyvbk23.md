 <p>IN the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc:<br> 2 Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee welcome to Prajâpati.<br> This is thy place: Sûrya thy majesty.<br> The majesty that has accrued to thee in the day, in a year,<br> that majesty which has accrued in the wind, in the firmament,<br> to that majesty of thine, to Prajâpati, to the Gods,<br> All-hail!<br> 3 Who, by his, grandeur hath become sole Ruler of all the.<br> moving world that breathes and slumbers;<br> He who is Sovran of these men and cattlewhat God shall<br> we adore with our oblation?<br> 4 Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee welcome to Prajâpati,<br> This is thy place: the Moon thy majesty.<br> Thy majesty that has accrued to thee by night, in a year,<br> thy majesty that has accrued in the earth, in Agni, in the<br> stars and in the Moon, to that majesty of thine, to Prajâpati<br> and to the Gods, All-hail!<br> 5 They who stand round hills as he moves harness the bright,<br> the ruddy Steed:<br> The lights are shining in the sky.<br> 6 On both sides to the car they yoke the two. Bay Coursers<br> dear to him,<br> Bold; tawny, bearers of the Chief.<br> 7 When, swift as wind, the Horse has reached the form that<br> Indra loves, the flood,<br> Again, O singer, by this path bring thou our Courser hitherward.</p>

 <p>8 Let the Vasus anoint thee with Gâyatrî metre. Let the<br> Rudras anoint thee with Trishtup metre. Let the Âdityas<br> anoint thee with Jagatî metre. Earth! Ether! Heaven!<br> O Gods, eat this food, parched grains and groats in the<br> product of barley and in the product of cows: eat this<br> food, Prajâpati.<br> 9 Who moveth single and alone? Who is brought forth to life<br> again?<br> What is the remedy of cold, or what the great receptacle?<br> 10 The Sun moves single and alone. The Moon is brought to<br> life again,<br> Fire is the remedy of cold; Earth is the great receptacle.<br> 11 What was the antecedent thought? What was the bird of<br> mighty size?<br> The slippery matron, who was she? Who was the<br> reddish-coloured one?<br> 12 Heaven was the antecedent thought. The Courser was the<br> mighty bird.<br> The slippery matron was the earth, Night was the<br> reddish-coloured one.<br> 13 Vâyu help thee with cooked viands! Blackneck with goats;<br> Nyagrodha with cups; Salmali with increase; this Stallion<br> here, good for the chariotlet him verily come with<br> his four feet. Brahmâkrishna help us! Obeisance to Agni!</p>

 <p>14 The car is fitted with the rein, the steed is fitted with the rein.<br> Fitted in waters, water-born, is Brahmâ following Soma's lead.<br> 15 Steed, from thy body, of thyself, sacrifice and accept thyself.<br> Thy greatness can be gained by none but thee.<br> 16 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by<br> fair paths to the Gods thou guest,<br> May Savitar the God in that world place thee where dwell<br> the pious, whether they have journeyed.<br> 17 Agni was the victim. With him they sacrificed. He won this<br> world in which Agni is. This shall become thy world.<br> This shalt thou win. Drink these waters. Vâyu was the<br> victim. With him they sacrificed. He won this world<br> in which Vâyu is. This shall become, etc., as above.<br> Sûrya was the victim, etc, He won the world in which<br> Sûrya is. This shall become, etc.<br> 18 To vital breath, Hail! To out-breathing, Hail! To diffusive<br> breath, Hail!<br> Ambâ! Ambikâ! Ambâlikâ! No one is taking me away.<br> The sorry horse will lie beside another, as Subhadrâ, the<br> dweller in Kâmpila.</p>

 <p>37 They, made of silver, gold, and lead, are used as helpers in<br> the work.<br> As lines on the strong Courser's skin may they console and<br> give thee rest.<br> 38 What then? As men whose fields are full of barley, etc., as<br> in X. 32.<br> 39 Who flays thee? Who dissects thee? Who prepares thy limbs<br> for sacrifice?<br> Who is the Sage that slaughters thee?<br> 40 In due time let the seasons as thy Slaughterers divide thy<br> joints,<br> And with the splendour of the Year sacrifice thee with holy<br> rites.<br> 41 Let the Half-months and let the Months, while sacrificing,<br> flay thy limbs:<br> Let Day and Night and Maruts mend each fault in sacrificing<br> thee.<br> 42 Let the divine Adhvaryus flay thy body and dissect thy<br> frame,<br> And let the sacrificing lines prepare thy members joint by<br> joint,<br> 43 May Sky, Earth, Air, and Wind supply each failing and<br> defect of thine:<br> May Sûrya with the Stars of heaven duly prepare a world<br> for thee.<br> 44 Well be it with thine upper parts, well be it with the parts<br> below!<br> Well he it with thy bones and with thy marrow and with all<br> thy frame!<br> 45 Who moveth singly? etc., as in verse 9.<br> 46 The Sun moves singly, etc., as in verse 10.<br> 47 What lustre is like Sûrya's light? What lake is equal to the<br> Sea?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>  
 <p>What is more spacious than the Earth? What thing is that<br> which naught can mete?<br> 48 Brahma is lustre like the Sea. Heaven is a flood to match<br> the Sea.<br> Indra is vaster than the Earth. Beyond all measure is the<br> Cow.<br> 49 Friend of the Gods, I ask, for information, if thou in spirit<br> hast obtained the knowledge,<br> Hath Vishnu this whole Universe pervaded in the three steps<br> wherein the God is worshipped?<br> 50 I also am in those three steps of Vishnu wherewith this Universe <br> he permeated.<br> The earth and heaven I circle in a moment and this heaven's<br> summit with a single organ.<br> 51 What are the things which Purusha hath entered? What<br> things hath Purusha contained within him?<br> This riddle we propound to thee, O Brahman. Why dost<br> thou give no answer to my question?<br> 52 Within five things hath Purusha found entrance; these<br> Purusha hath within himself connected.<br> This is the thought which I return in answer. Thou art<br> not my superior in wisdom.<br> 53 What was the antecedent thought? etc., as in verse 11.<br> 54 Heaven was the antecedent thought, etc., as in 12.<br> 55 Who, tell me, is the yellowish she? Who is the darkly-<br> yellowish?<br> Who moves with rapid spring and bound? Who glides and<br> winds along the path?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>56 The she-goat, Sir, is yellowish, dark-yellowish is the porcupine.<br> The hare moves swift with leap and bound: the snake creeps<br> winding on the path.<br> 57 How many different forms hath this, how many syllables,<br> burnt-oblations, brands for kindling?<br> Here, of the rites of sacrifice I ask thee. How many Hotars<br> in due season worship?<br> 68 Sixfold its form, its syllables a hundred, eighty burnt-offerings,<br> just three brands for kindling.<br> To thee I tell the rites of sacrificing. Seven Hotars worship<br> in appointed season.<br> 59 Who knoweth this world's central point? Who knoweth the<br> heaven, the earth, and the wide air between them?<br> Who knows the birthplace of the mighty Sûrya? Who knows<br> the Moon, whence he was generated?<br> 60 I know the centre of the world about us. I know heaven,<br> earth, and the wide air between them.<br> I know the birthplace of the mighty Sûrya. I know the<br> Moon, whence he was generated.<br> 61 I ask thee of the earth's extremest limit, where is the<br> centre of the world, I ask thee.<br> I ask thee of the Stallion's genial humour, I ask of highest<br> heaven where Speech abideth.<br> 62 This altar is the earth's extremest limit; this sacrifice of<br> ours is the world's centre.<br> This Soma is the Stallion's genial humour, this Brahman<br> highest heaven where Speech abideth.</p>

 <p>63 The Strong, the Self-existent One, the First, within the<br> mighty flood<br> Laid down the timely embryo from which Prajâpati was born.<br> 64 Let the Hotar sacrifice to Prajâpati from the Mahiman-Soma.<br> Let him accept. Let him drink the Soma. Hotar, sacrifice.<br> 65 Prajâpati, thou only, etc., as in X. 20.</p>
