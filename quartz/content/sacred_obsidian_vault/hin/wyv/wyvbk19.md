Accept<br> the sacrifice arranged with portions.<br> 68 Now let us pay this homage to the Fathers, to those who<br> passed of old and those who followed,<br> Those who have rested in the earthly region and those who<br> dwell among the Mighty Races.<br> 69 As in the days of old our ancient Fathers speeding the work<br> of holy worship, Agni!<br> Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises, they cleft<br> the ground and made red Dawns apparent.<br> 70 Right gladly do we set thee down, right gladly make thee<br> burn and glow.<br> Gladly bring yearning Fathers nigh to eat the food of<br> sacrifice.<br> 71 Indra, with waters foam didst thou wrench off the head of<br> Namuchi,<br> Subduing all contending hosts.<br> 72 King Soma, pressed, the Drink of Life, left Death behind<br> with Soma-dregs.<br> By Law came truth and Indra-power, the pure bright drinking-off<br> of juice. The power of Indra was this sweet immortal<br> milk.<br> 73 The Snipe of Angiras by thought from out the waters<br> drank up milk.<br> By Law came truth, etc., as in 72.</p>

By Law, etc.<br> 76 The generative part enters the <i>yoni:</i> it leaves aside the<br> <i>retas</i> and the <i>mûtra</i>.<br> The caul-invested embryo leaves by its birth the covering<br> folds. By Law, etc.<br> 77 Viewing both forms Prajâpati gave truth and falsehood<br> different shapes.<br> Prajâpati assigned the lack of faith to falsehood, faith to<br> truth. By Law, etc.<br> 78 By holy lore Prajâpati drank up both forms, pressed and<br> unpressed.<br> By Law, etc.<br> 79 Seeing the farming liquor's sap, Prajâpati with the bright<br> drank nut the bright the milk, the Soma juice.
