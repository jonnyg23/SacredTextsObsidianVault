 <p align="center">(Sanskrit form MĀṆIKYA VĀCHAKA)</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the days when the powerful Pāndyan Kings flourished in Madura, there was once a prime minister who early became convinced of the transitoriness of this world's life and its riches. When on a visit to Perundurai, now Āvudaiyārkoil in the Tanjore District, he suddenly and completely came under the influence of a Brahman religious teacher, who for him was the manifestation of the very God Himself. Then and there he began to sing the "Sacred Utterance" (Tiruvāsaham), and was named by his preceptor "Utterer of Jewels" (Māṇikka Vāsahar). Returning to Madura, he forsook his high office with all its rewards, to become a religious poet wandering without earthly attachments from shrine to shrine. The stories clustering around his religious experience can be read by English readers in Dr. Pope's great edition of his work. We find him practising austerities at Chidambaram, or miraculously giving the gift of speech to the dumb daughter of the Chōl̤a king, or defeating in disputation a band of Buddhists from Ceylon, but of certain historical information about him we have practically none. Even the question of the century in which he lived is a battleground of the antiquarians. Tradition places him in the fifth century, earlier than the writers of the Dēvāram;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>but the opinion of scholars seems to be converging on the view that he lived in the latter half of the ninth, or the first half of the tenth century of our era. Another of his works is the Tirukkōvaiyār, an erotic poem of four hundred stanzas. Among Tamil Śaivite writers none makes a stronger devotional appeal than Māṇikka Vāsahar. There is a common Tamil saying that nothing can melt the heart of the man who is not melted by the Tiruvāsaham.</p>

 <p>Stanzas 80-92 are samples from an opening poem of one hundred stanzas, each ten of which has its own metre and is fairly complete in itself. They fairly reflect the saint's varying moods. Notice the importance he attaches to emotion; his worst self-reproach is for feeling no frenzy. As to his conception of God, see how the word 'grace' recurs in nearly every stanza. And yet that God of grace is called (in No. 84) both being and non-existence.</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Hundred Verses</span></h5>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">80.

I cry with anguish torn.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">84. The sky, earth, wind, the light, our very flesh and life art Thou,<br> Being art Thou, non-being too, Thou king, who see’st how<br> Men dance like puppets with their foolish thoughts of 'I' and 'Mine,'<br> While Thou the cords dost pull. What words can tell Thy praise divine?</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">85. At sound of cries like this, "O Bull-rider whose spreading hair<br> The falling stream receives!

Ah! wretched that I am, who only moan!<br> My two eyes are unfeeling wood, my heart a great dead stone!</div>

 <p></p><hr width="50%">  
 <p>Our next five stanzas, taken from a hymn of fifty, are full of the pathos expressed in the title, which is a refrain recurring in every verse. Only flashes of the light of the presence of God pierce the prevailing gloom. The saint cannot free himself from sensuality,</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">98. Whether I praise or curse Thee, still I'm stained with sin and sorrowing.<br>   Yet, wilt Thou leave me?

 <p>Our poet made songs which maidens might sing in their rhythmical games, or as they sat at the grinding-stone. In India the boatman sings as he rows, the ryot sings as he draws from the well, the sepoy sings on his march. A feature of such songs is the refrain, which is usually a mere collection of euphonic syllables, though it may have a meaning. Here are specimens of a few songs intended for women. The refrain of the first, "Ēlōrembāvāy" probably means "Receive and ponder what I say, O lady." The Grinding song, strangely enough, is used at funerals, as also is the 'Antiphony.' The song of 'The Three Castles’ Destruction' is supposed to accompany play with a ball or a kind of shuttle called 'undī.' For the legend of the Three Castles, see page <a href="htss02.htm#page_7">7</a>. 'The Shoulder-Play' is for some ancient game in which women grasped each other's shoulders.</p>

 <p>In the poetry of all lands lovers have appealed to birds to be their messengers to the distant loved one. This is so common in Indian poetry as to have become a recognised convention. Here the saint sends his message of love and devotion, in one case by a humming bee, in the other by the Indian cuckoo, to Śiva who dwells in Tillai, i.e. Chidambaram.</p>

 <p>One of the little childishnesses involved in idolatry is that every morning with solemn ceremony the idol must be wakened from his sleep, bathed, and dressed.

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">121. Caught am I in passion's snare from women's liquid eyes;<br>   Stabbed at heart, a cur. O wisdom's light, no aid I see.<br> Only lord, whose lady's feet are softer than the down,<br>   How I long to hear Thy coral lips speak cheer to me.</div>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Longings For Death</span></h5>

Our lord supreme, both earth and heav’n indwelling,<br>   See how I have no other help but Thee.<br> Thou king of Śiva's world, bright beyond telling,<br>   Dweller in Perunduṛai, look on me.<br> Who'll hear my cry, who list to my complaining,<br>   If Thou Thy grace deny, who saved’st me?<br> I find in sea-girt earth no joy remaining.<br>   Now let Thy grace speak, bid me come to Thee.</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">124.

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">127. I ask not fame, wealth, earth or heav’n. No birth, no death for me.<br> None will I touch who love not Śiva.

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">128. Art Thou like honey on the branch too high for me to climb?<br> Or art Thou nectar ocean-churned? O Hara, King sublime,<br> In Perunduṛai, circled with moist fields, I can set Thee<br> With form ash-smeared, the spotless. Can I bear my ecstasy?</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">129. Many in this great earth who live do penance; I alone<br> Bearing this frame of flesh, a barren jungle-tree have grown.<br> Dweller in Perunduṛai old where blooms the kondai tree,<br> May I the sinner cry "Wilt Thou not grant Thyself to me"?</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">131. I fear no javelin's gory blade;<br> Nor sidelong glance of bangled maid;<br> But when I see men void of grace<br> Drinking no sweetness from the praise<br> Of my unchiselled Gem, whose dance<br> In Tillai's hail is seen, whose glance<br> Melts men's whole frame in ecstasy<br> Terror such sight inspires in me.</div>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I Cling to Thee</span></h5>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">136. I had no virtue, penance, knowledge, self-control. A doll to turn<br>   At others’ will I danced, whirled, fell. But me He filled in every limb<br> With love's mad longing, and that I might climb there whence is no return,<br>   He shewed His beauty, made me His. Ah me, when shall I go to Him?</div>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Wonder of Grace</span></h5>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">137. Fool's friend was I, none such may know<br>   The way of freedom; yet to me<br> He shew’d the path of love, that so<br>   Fruit of past deeds might ended be.<br>     Cleansing my mind so foul, He made me like a god.<br>     Ah who could win that which the Father hath bestowed?</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">138. Thinking it right, sin's path I trod;<br>   But, so that I such paths might leave,<br> And find His grace, the dancing God,<br>   Who far beyond our thought doth live,<br>     O wonder passing great!—to me His dancing shewed.<br>     Ah who could win that which the Father hath bestowed?</div>
