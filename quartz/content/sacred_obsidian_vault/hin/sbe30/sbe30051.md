 <p>in the morning and in the evening he brings (to his teacher) the food which he has received as alms and a pot of water; every day (he fetches) a bundle of firewood; in the morning and in the evening, or daily in the evening he puts fuel on (the fire, in the following way):</p>  
 <p>3. <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">3</font></a> Before sprinkling (water) round (the fire), he wipes (with his wet hand) from left to right round (the fire) with the verse, 'As you have loosed, O Vasus, the buffalo-cow' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. IV, 7, 15, 7), and sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.</p>  
 <p>4. <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">4</font></a> (Then) he puts (four) pieces of wood (on the fire) with the single (Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis) and with (the three Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis) together, and (four other pieces) with (the following four verses),</p>  
 <p>'This fuel is thine, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we grow and gain vigour. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'May Indra give me insight; may Sarasvatî, the goddess, (give) insight; may both A<i>s</i>vins, wreathed with lotus, bestow insight on me. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'The insight that dwells with the Apsaras, the mind that dwells with the Gandharvas, the divine insight and that which is born from men: may that insight, the fragrant one, rejoice in me! Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>'May insight, the fragrant one, that assumes all shapes, the gold-coloured, mobile one, come to me. Rich in sap, swelling with milk, may she, insight, the lovely-faced one, rejoice in me! Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">5</font></a> Having wiped round (the fire) in the same way, he sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.</p>

 <p>6. <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">6</font></a> He worships the fire with the Mantras, 'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. III, 5, 3, 2), and 'On me may insight, on me offspring' (Taitt. Âra<i>n</i>yaka X, 44).</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">7</font></a> After the lapse of those three days (Sûtra 1) he serves in the same way the three kinds of food (stated above) to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' and discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras) with (the necessary) alterations, 'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow' (see above, I, 2, 7, 8).</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">8</font></a> He keeps the same observances afterwards (also),</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">9</font></a> Dwelling in his teacher's house. He may eat, (however,) pungent and saline food and vegetables.</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">10</font></a> He wears a staff, has his hair tied in one knot, and wears a girdle,</p>  
 <p>11. Or he may tie the lock on the crown of the head in a knot.</p>

 <p>twenty-four (years), or twelve (years), or until he has learnt (the Veda).</p>  
 <p>15. He should not, however, omit keeping the observances.</p>  
 <p>16. <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_541"><font size="1">16</font></a> At the beginning and on the completion of the study of a Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (of the Black Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda he sacrifices) with (the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful one, the friend of Indra, the dear one, I have entreated for the gift of insight. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>In the second place the <i>Ri</i>shi of the Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (receives an oblation).</p>  
 <p>(Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu<i>n</i>a;' 'For this I entreat thee;' 'Thou, Agni;' 'Thus thou, Agni;' 'Thou, Agni, art quick;' 'Pra<i>g</i>âpati!' and, 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice.' Here some add as subordinate oblations the <i>G</i>aya, Abhyâtâna, and Râsh<i>t</i>rabh<i>ri</i>t (oblations) as above.</p>
