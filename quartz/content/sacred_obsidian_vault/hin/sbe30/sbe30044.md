 <p>have his hair shaven, and after (the boy) has bathed and has been decked with ornaments</p>  
 <p>8. He should dress him in a (new) garment which has not yet been washed.</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">9</font></a> In a place inclined towards the east, (or) inclined towards the north, (or) inclined towards northeast, or in an even (place), he raises (the surface on which he intends to sacrifice), sprinkles it with water,</p>  
 <p>10. Kindles fire by attrition, or fetches common (worldly) fire, puts the fire down, and puts wood on the fire.</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">11</font></a> He strews eastward-pointed Darbha grass round the fire;</p>  
 <p>12. Or (the grass which is strewn) to the west and to the east (of the fire), may be northward-pointed.</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">13</font></a> He (arranges the Darbha blades so as to) lay the southern (blades) uppermost, the northern ones below, if their points are turned (partly) towards the east and (partly) towards the north.</p>

 <p>17. <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">17</font></a> A stone, a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, a skin (of an antelope, or a spotted deer, &amp;c.), a threefold-twisted girdle of Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass if he is a Brâhma<i>n</i>a (who shall be initiated), a bowstring for a Râ<i>g</i>anya, a woollen thread for a Vai<i>s</i>ya, a staff of Bilva or of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood for a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, of Nyagrodha wood for a Râ<i>g</i>anya, of Udumbara wood for a Vai<i>s</i>ya.</p>  
 <p>18. <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">18</font></a> He binds together the fuel, twenty-one pieces of wood, or as many as there are oblations to be made.</p>  
 <p>19. Together with that fuel he ties up the (three) branches of wood which are to be laid round the fire, (which should have the shape of) pegs.</p>  
 <p>20. <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">20</font></a> (He gets ready, besides, the spoon called) Darvî, a bunch of grass, the Â<i>g</i>ya pot, the pot for the Pra<i>n</i>îta water, and whatever (else) is required;</p>

 <p>22. <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">22</font></a> At that time the Brahman suspends the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, sips water, passes by the fire, on its west side, to the south side, throws away a grass blade from the Brahman's seat, touches water, and sits down with his face turned towards the fire.</p>

 <p>24. <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">24</font></a> Having consecrated the Proksha<i>n</i>î water by means of the purifiers as before, having placed the vessels upright, and having untied the fuel, he sprinkles (the sacrificial vessels) three times with the whole (Proksha<i>n</i>î water).</p>  
 <p>25. <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">25</font></a> Having warmed the Darvî spoon (over the fire), having wiped it, and warmed it again, he puts it down.</p>  
 <p>26. Having besprinkled (with water) the Darbha grass with which the fuel was tied together, he throws it into the fire.</p>

The statement commonly given in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras and Dharma-sûtras is, that the initiation of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall take place in his eighth year, though there are differences of opinion whether in the eighth year after conception, or after birth (Â<i>s</i>valâyana-G<i>ri</i>hya I, 19, 1. 2). Mât<i>ri</i>datta states that the rule given here in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra refers to the seventh year after birth. In the Dharma-sûtra (comp. Âpastamba I, 1, 18) it is stated that the initiation of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall take place in the eighth year after his conception.
