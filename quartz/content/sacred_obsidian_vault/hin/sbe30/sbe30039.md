 <p>1. <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">1</font></a> Let him select the site for building his house</p>  
 <p>2. On even ground, which is covered with grass, which cannot be destroyed (by inundations, &amp;c.),</p>  
 <p>3. On which the waters flow off to the east or to the north,</p>  
 <p>4. On which plants grow which have no milky juice or thorns, and which are not acrid.</p>  
 <p>5. The earth should be white, if he is a Brâhma<i>n</i>a,</p>  
 <p>6. Red, if he is a Kshatriya,</p>  
 <p>7. Black, if he is a Vai<i>s</i>ya.</p>  
 <p>8. (The soil should be) compact, one-coloured, not dry, not salinous, not surrounded by sandy desert, not swampy.</p>  
 <p>9. (Soil) on which Darbha grass grows, (should be chosen) by one who is desirous of holy lustre,</p>  
 <p>10. (Soil covered) with big sorts of grass, by one who is desirous of strength,</p>  
 <p>11. (Soil covered) with tender grass, by one who is desirous of cattle.</p>

 <p>12. (The site of the house) should have the form of a brick,</p>  
 <p>13. Or it should have the form of a round island.</p>  
 <p>14. Or there should be natural holes (in the ground) in all directions.</p>  
 <p>15. On such (ground) one who is desirous of fame or strength, should build his house with its door to the east;</p>  
 <p>16. One who is desirous of children or of cattle, (should build it) with its door to the north;</p>  
 <p>17. One who is desirous of all (those things), (should build it) with its door to the south.</p>  
 <p>18. Let him not build it with its door to the west.</p>  
 <p>19. <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">19</font></a> And a back-door.</p>

 <p>30. Or (only) milk-rice.</p>  
 <p>31. Having mingled together the fat (of the animal), Â<i>g</i>ya, its flesh, and the milk-rice,</p>  
 <p>32. He should take eight portions (of that mixture) and should sacrifice (the following eight oblations):</p>  
 <p>33. The first (verse, accompanying the first oblation), is, 'Vâstoshpati!' (MB. II, 6, 1).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_422"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_422">120:1</a> 7, 1 seq. Comp. Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 2, 6 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_423"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_423">121:19</a> 19-21. I have translated the words of these Sûtras without trying to express any meaning. According to the commentary the meaning is the following: 19. He should not build a house which has its door on the back-side, or which has one front-door and one back-door. 20. The house-door should not face the door of another house. 21. The house-door should be so constructed that the householder cannot be seen by <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âlas, &amp;c., when he is performing religious acts or when dining in his house. Or, if instead of sa<i>m</i>lokî the reading sa<i>m</i>loki is accepted, the Sûtra means: the house-door should be so constructed, that valuable objects, &amp;c., which are in the house, cannot be seen by passers-by.The commentary on Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 2, 15 contains the remark: dvâradvaya<i>m</i> (var. lectio, dvâra<i>m</i> dvâra<i>m</i>) parasparam <i>ri</i><i>g</i>u na syâd iti ke<i>k</i>it. This seems to me to lead to the right understanding of these Sûtras. I think we ought to read and to divide in this way: (19) anudvâra<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a. (20. 21) g<i>ri</i>hadvâra<i>m</i> yathâ na sa<i>m</i>loki syât. 'And (let him construct) a back-door, so that it does not face the (chief) house-door.' The Khâdira MSS. have the readings, asallokî, asandraloke, sa<i>m</i>loka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_424"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_424">122:22</a> 22-24. These are <i>S</i>lokas to which the commentary very appropriately, though not exactly in the sense in which it was originally set down, applies the dictum so frequently found in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a texts: na hy ekasmâd aksharâd virâdhayanti. Dr. Knauer's attempts to restore correct <i>S</i>lokas are perhaps a little hazardous; he inserts in the third verse <i>k</i>a after plakshas, and in the second he changes the first brûyât into <i>k</i>a, whereby the second foot of the hemistich loses its regular shape <a name="img_12200"></a>
 <img src="img/12200.jpg">, and receives instead of it the form <a name="img_12201"></a>
 <img src="img/12201.jpg">.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_425"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_425">122:25</a> He should remove an A<i>s</i>vattha tree from the east-side, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_426"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_426">122:26</a> He should sacrifice to the deities to whom the transplanted trees are sacred.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_427"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_427">122:27</a> 27 seq. Here begins the description of the vâstu<i>s</i>amana, which extends to Sûtra 43. As to the animal sacrifice prescribed in this Sûtra, comp. Dr. Winternitz's essay, Einige Bemerkungen über das Bauopfer bei den Indern (Sitzungsbericht der Anthrop. Gesellschaft in Wien, 19 April, 1887), p. 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_428"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_428">123:34</a> Comp. above, chap. 6, 7 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_429"></a><a href="sbe30039.htm#fr_429">123:36</a> The commentary says: 'The last oblation should be offered with the formula, "To Pra<i>g</i>âpati svâhâ!"' Probably we ought to correct the text, Pra<i>g</i>âpata ity uttamâ, 'the last (verse) is, "Pra<i>g</i>âpati!" (MB. II, 5, 8);' see above, IV, 6, 9; Khâdira-G<i>ri</i>hya IV, 2, 20.</p>
