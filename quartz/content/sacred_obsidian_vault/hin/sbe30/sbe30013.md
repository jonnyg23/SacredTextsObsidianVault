 <p>1. <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">1</font></a> Under a propitious Nakshatra let him take a wife</p>  
 <p>2. <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">2</font></a> Who should possess the auspicious characteristics in due way.</p>  
 <p>3. If he can find no such (woman, he should take) earth-clods</p>  
 <p>4. <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">4</font></a> From an altar, a furrow, a pool, a cow-stable, a place where four roads meet, a gambling-place, a place where corpses are burnt, and from sterile soil;</p>  
 <p>5. A ninth (earth-clod) mixed of all.</p>  
 <p>6. (These he should make) equal (and should) make marks at them.</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">7</font></a> Taking them in his hand he should offer them to the girl, and (reciting the formula): 'Right alone is the first; right nobody oversteps; on right this earth is founded. May N.N. become this universe!'he should pronounce her name and should say: 'Take one of these.'</p>  
 <p>8. If she takes one of the first four (clods), he should marry her,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>9. <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">9</font></a> And according to some (teachers) also, if (she takes) the mixed one.</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">10</font></a> After she has been washed with Klîtaka, barley and beans, a friend should besprinkle her three times at her head, so that her whole body becomes wet, with Surâ of first quality, with (the formula), 'Kâma! I know thy name. Intoxication thou art by name,' &amp;c. (Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 2). (In the passage of the formula), 'Bring hither N.N.,' he should pronounce the husband's name. (The Mantras should have) the word Svâhâ at their end. With the two following verses he should wash her private parts.</p>  
 <p>11. That has to be done by (female) relatives (of the bride).</p>  
 <p>12. At the wedding wood has been put on the fire to the east of the house, on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung).</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">13</font></a> Then one of the people who assist at the wedding, fills a cup with 'firm' water, and having walked with the water-pot round the fire on its front side, silent, wrapped in his robe, he stations himself to the south (of the fire), facing the north</p>  
 <p>14. Another person with a goad (walks in the same way and stations himself in the same place).</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>15. They place roasted grain mixed with <i>S</i>amî leaves, to the amount of four handfuls, in a winnowing basket behind the fire,</p>  
 <p>16. And an upper mill-stone.</p>  
 <p>17. <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">17</font></a> Now (the girl) whose hand he is going to seize, has been washed, (her whole body) including her head.</p>  
 <p>18. The husband should put on her a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, with the verse, 'They who spun' (Mantra-Brâhma<i>n</i>a I, 1, 5), and with (the verse), 'Put on her, dress her' (l.l. 6).</p>  
 <p>19. Leading forward (from the house to the sacred fire, the bride) who is wrapped in her robe and wears the sacrificial cord over her left shoulder, he should murmur (the verse), 'Soma gave her to the Gandharva' (MB. I, 1, 7).</p>  
 <p>20. <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">20</font></a> While she, to the west of the fire, pushes forward with her foot a rush-mat or something else of that kind, veiled (with clothes), he should make her say: 'May the way which my husband goes, be open to me.'</p>  
 <p>21. If she does not murmur (these words out of shame, &amp;c.), he should murmur (them, saying), 'To her' (instead of 'To me').</p>  
 <p>22. She should make the end of the rush-mat (Sûtra 20) reach the end of the Barhis.</p>  
 <p>23. On the east end of the rush-mat she sits down to the right of the bridegroom.</p>

 <p>24. <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">24</font></a> While she touches his right shoulder with her right hand, he sacrifices six oblations of Â<i>g</i>ya with (the verse), 'May Agni go as the first,' and the following (verses) (MB. I, 1, 9-14)</p>  
 <p>25. And (three oblations) with the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, one by one;</p>  
 <p>26. A fourth with (the four Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis) together.</p>
