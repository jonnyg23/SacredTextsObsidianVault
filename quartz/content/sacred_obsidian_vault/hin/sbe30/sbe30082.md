 <p>'With the waters that spring in the east and those that come from the north: with the waters, the supporters of the whole world, I interpose another one between (myself and) my father. Svadhâ! Adoration!</p>  
 <p>'I interpose (another one) through the mountains;</p>  
 <p>'I interpose through the wide earth; through the sky and the points of the horizon, through infinite bliss I interpose another one between (myself and) my grandfather. Svadhâ! Adoration!</p>
