 <p>1. 'As the wind blows, as the ocean waves, thus may the embryo move; may it come forth together with the after-birth'with (this verse) he strokes (her body) from above downwards.</p>  
 <p>2. When the child is born, he lays an axe on a stone, and a piece of gold on that axe; after he has turned these things upside down (so that the stone lies uppermost), he holds the boy over them with (the two verses),</p>  
 <p>'Be a stone, be an axe, be insuperable gold. Thou indeed art the Veda called son; so live a hundred autumns.</p>

 <p>'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou indeed art the self (âtman) called son; so live a hundred autumns.'</p>

 <p>4. They take the Aupâsana (or regular G<i>ri</i>hya) fire away, and they bring the Sûtikâgni (or the fire of the confinement).</p>  
 <p>5. That (fire) is only used for warming (dishes, etc.).</p>  
 <p>6. No ceremonies are performed with it except the fumigation (see the next Sûtra).</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">7</font></a> He fumigates (the child) with small grains mixed with mustard seeds. These he throws into the coals (of the Sûtikâgni) (eleven times, each time with one of the following Mantras):</p>  
 <p>(a) 'May <i>S</i>a<i>n</i><i>d</i>a and Marka, Upavîra, <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikera, Ulûkhala, <i>K</i>yavana vanish from here. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(b) 'Âlikhat, Vilikhat, Animisha, Ki<i>m</i>vadanta, Upa<i>s</i>ruti. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(c) 'Aryam<i>n</i>a, Kumbhin, <i>S</i>atru, Pâtrapâ<i>n</i>i, Nipu<i>n</i>i. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(d) 'May Ântrîmukha, Sarshapâru<i>n</i>a vanish from here. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(e) 'Ke<i>s</i>inî, <i>S</i>valominî, Ba<i>g</i>âbo<i>g</i>â, Upakâ<i>s</i>inigo away, vanish from here. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(f) 'The servants of Kuvera, Vi<i>s</i>vavâsa (?), sent by the king of demons, all of one common origin,</p>

 <p>walk through the villages, visiting those who wake (?). Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(g) '"Kill them! Bind them!" thus (says) this messenger of Brahman. Agni has encompassed them. Indra knows them; B<i>ri</i>haspati knows them; I the Brâhma<i>n</i>a know them who seize (men), who have prominent teeth, rugged hair, hanging breasts. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(h) 'The night-walkers, wearing ornaments on their breasts, with lances in their hands, drinking out of skulls! Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(i) 'Their father U<i>k</i><i>k</i>ai<i>h</i><i>s</i>râvyakar<i>n</i>aka walks (?) at their head, their mother walks in the rear, seeking a vikhura (?) in the village. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(k) 'The sister, the night-walker, looks at the family through the rift (?)she who wakes while people sleep, whose mind is turned on the wife that has become mother. Svâhâ!</p>  
 <p>(l) 'O god with the black path, Agni, burn the lungs, the hearts, the livers of those (female demons); burn their eyes. Svâhâ!'</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">8</font></a> Then he washes his hands and touches the ground with (the verses), 'O thou whose hair is well parted! Thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon: of that immortality impart to us. May I not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my sons.</p>  
 <p>'I know thy heart, O earth, that dwells in heaven, in the moon: thus may I, the lord of immortality, not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my sons.'</p>

 <p>of intelligence). With (an instrument of) gold over which he has laid a Darbha shoot tied (to that piece of gold) he gives to the child, which is held so that it faces the east, ghee to eat, with the formulas, 'Bhû<i>h</i>! I sacrifice the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as over thee! Bhuva<i>h</i>! I sacrifice the Ya<i>g</i>us over thee! Suva<i>h</i>! I sacrifice the Sâmans over thee! Bhûr bhuva<i>h</i> suva<i>h</i>! I sacrifice the Atharvan and Aṅgiras hymns over thee!'</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">10</font></a> He then bathes the child with lukewarm water with (the following Mantras):</p>  
 <p>'From chronic disease, from destruction, from wile, from Varu<i>n</i>a's fetter I release thee. I make thee guiltless before the Brahman; may both Heaven and Earth be kind towards thee.</p>  
 <p>'May Agni together with the waters bring thee bliss, Heaven and Earth together with the herbs; may the air together with the wind bring thee bliss; may the four quarters of the heaven bring thee bliss.</p>  
 <p>'Rightly have the gods released the sun from darkness and from the seizing demon; they have dismissed him from guilt; thus I deliver this boy from chronic disease, from curse that comes from his kin, from wile, from Varu<i>n</i>a's fetter.'</p>
