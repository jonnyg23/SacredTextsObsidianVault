 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)</i>, by Hermann Oldenberg, [1892], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">KÂ<i>N</i><i>D</i>IKÂ 2.</h3>  
 <p>1. <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">1</font></a> On the following day the Anvash<i>t</i>akya (ceremony is performed),</p>  
 <p>2. Or on the day which follows after that.</p>  
 <p>3. To the south-east (of the house), in the intermediate direction (between south and east), they partition off (a place with mats or the like).</p>  
 <p>4. The long-side (of that place should lie) in the same (direction).</p>  
 <p>5. They should perform (the ceremonies) turning their faces towards the same (direction).</p>  
 <p>6. (It should measure) at least four prakramas (i.e. steps).</p>  
 <p>7. (It should have) its entrance from the west.</p>  
 <p>8. <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">8</font></a> In the northern part of that enclosure they make the Laksha<i>n</i>a and carry the fire (to that place).</p>  
 <p>9. To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks, holding his left hand uppermost, one handful of rice-grains which he has seized with one grasp.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. When (the rice) has been husked,</p>  
 <p>11. He should once carefully remove the husks.</p>  
 <p>12. <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">12</font></a> And then he should cut off a lump of flesh from that thigh and should cut it in small pieces on a new slaughtering-bench,</p>  
 <p>13. (With the intention) that the Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>as (or lumps of food offered to the Manes) should be thoroughly mixed up with flesh.</p>  
 <p>14. <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">14</font></a> On the same fire he cooks one mess of rice-grains and one of meat, stirring up the one and the other separately, from right to left, with the two pot-ladles.</p>  
 <p>15. <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">15</font></a> After he has cooked them, he should pour (Â<i>g</i>ya) on them, should take them from the fire towards the south, and should not pour (Â<i>g</i>ya) on them again.</p>  
 <p>16. In the southern part of the enclosure (Sûtras 3 seq.) he should have three pits dug, so that the eastern (pit is dug) first,</p>  
 <p>17. One span in length, four inches in breadth and in depth.</p>  
 <p>18. <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">18</font></a> Having made the Laksha<i>n</i>a to the east of the eastern pit, they carry the fire (to that place).</p>  
 <p>19. Having carried the fire round the pits on their west side, he should put it down on the Laksha<i>n</i>a.</p>  
 <p>20. He strews (round the fire) one handful of Darbha grass which he has cut off in one portion.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>21. And (he strews it into) the pits,</p>  
 <p>22. Beginning with the eastern (pit).</p>  
 <p>23. To the west of the pits he should have a layer spread out,</p>  
 <p>24. Of southward-pointed Ku<i>s</i>a grass,</p>  
 <p>25. Inclined towards the south.</p>  
 <p>26. And he should put a mat on it.</p>  
 <p>27. <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">27</font></a> To that (layer of grass) they fetch for him (the following sacrificial implements), one by one, from right to left:</p>  
 <p>28. The two pots in which sacrificial food has been cooked (Sûtra 14), the two pot-ladles (Sûtra 14), one brazen vessel, one Darvî (spoon), and water.</p>  
 <p>29. <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">29</font></a> (The sacrificer's) wife places a stone on the Barhis and pounds (on that stone the fragrant substance called) Sthagara.</p>  
 <p>30. <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">30</font></a> And on the same (stone) she grinds some collyrium, and anoints therewith three Darbha blades, including the interstices (between the single blades?).</p>  
 <p>31. <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">31</font></a> He should also get some oil made from sesamum seeds,</p>  
 <p>32. <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">32</font></a> And a piece of linen tape.</p>  
 <p>33. <a name="fr_367"></a><a href="#fn_367"><font size="1">33</font></a> After he has invited an odd number of blameless Brâhma<i>n</i>as, whose faces should be turned towards the north, to sit down on a pure spot,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>34. <a name="fr_368"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">34</font></a> And has given them Darbha grass (in order that they may sit down thereon),</p>  
 <p>35. <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">35</font></a> He gives them (pure) water and afterwards sesamum-water, pronouncing his father's name, 'N.N.! To thee this sesamum-water, and to those who follow thee here, and to those whom thou followest. To thee Svadhâ!'</p>  
 <p>36. <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">36</font></a> After he has touched water, (he does) the same for the other two.</p>  
 <p>37. <a name="fr_371"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">37</font></a> In the same way (he gives them) perfumes.</p>  
 <p>38. <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">38</font></a> The words in which he addresses (the Brâhma<i>n</i>as) when going to sacrifice, are, 'I shall offer it into the fire.'</p>  
 <p>39. After they have replied, 'Offer it,' he should cut off (the prescribed portions) from the two messes of cooked food (Sûtra 14), (and should put those portions) into the brazen vessel. He then should sacrifice, picking out (portions of the Havis) with the pot-ladle, the first (oblation) with (the words), 'Svâhâ to Soma Pit<i>ri</i>mat,' the second with (the words), 'Svâhâ to Agni Kavyavâhana' (MB. II, 3, 1. 2).</p>
