 <p>1. <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">1</font></a> 'To him who comes (to us), we have come. Drive ye away death! May we walk with him safely; may he walk here in bliss; (may he) walk in bliss until (he returns) to his house'this (verse the teacher repeats) while (the boy) walks round the fire so as to keep his right side turned towards it.</p>  
 <p>2. <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">2</font></a> (The teacher) then causes him to say, 'I have come hither to be a student. Initiate me! I will be a student, impelled by the god Sâvitrî.'</p>  
 <p>3. (The teacher then) asks him:</p>  
 <p>4. 'What is thy name?'</p>  
 <p>5. <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">5</font></a> He says, 'N.N!'what his name is.</p>  
 <p>6. <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">6</font></a> (The teacher says), 'Happily, god Savit<i>ri</i>, may I attain the goal with this N.N.'here he pronounces (the student's) two names.</p>  
 <p>7. <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">7</font></a> With (the verse), 'For bliss may the goddesses afford us their protection; may the waters afford drink to us. With bliss and happiness may they overflow us'both wipe themselves off.</p>

 <p>8. <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">8</font></a> Then (the teacher) touches with his right hand (the boy's) right shoulder, and with his left (hand) his left (shoulder), and draws (the boy's) right arm towards himself with the Vyâh<i>ri</i>tis, the Sâvitrî verse, and with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i>, with the arms of the two A<i>s</i>vins, with Pûshan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.!'</p>  
 <p>9. <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">9</font></a> He then seizes with his right hand (the boy's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the words), 'Agni has seized thy hand; Soma has seized thy hand; Savit<i>ri</i> has seized thy hand; Sarasvatî has seized thy hand; Pûshan has seized thy hand; B<i>ri</i>haspati has seized thy hand; Mitra has seized thy hand; Varu<i>n</i>a has seized thy hand; Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> has seized thy hand; Dhât<i>ri</i> has seized thy hand; Vish<i>n</i>u has seized thy hand; Pra<i>g</i>âpati has seized thy hand.'</p>  
 <p>10. <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">10</font></a> 'May Savit<i>ri</i> protect thee. Mitra art thou by rights; Agni is thy teacher.</p>  
 <p>'By the impulse of the god Savit<i>ri</i> become B<i>ri</i>haspati's pupil. Eat water. Put on fuel. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time'thus (the teacher) instructs him.</p>  
 <p>11. <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">11</font></a> Then (the teacher) gradually moves his right</p>

 <p>hand down over (the boy's) right shoulder and touches the place of his heart with (the formulas), 'Thy heart shall dwell in my heart; my mind thou shalt follow with thy mind; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may B<i>ri</i>haspati join thee to me!</p>  
 <p>'To me alone thou shalt adhere. In me thy thoughts shall dwell. Upon me thy veneration shall be bent. When I speak, thou shalt be silent.'</p>  
 <p>12. With (the words), 'Thou art the knot of all breath; do not loosen thyself'(he touches) the place of his navel.</p>  
 <p>13. <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">13</font></a> After (the teacher) has recited over him (the formula),</p>  
 <p>'Bhû<i>h</i>! Bhuva<i>h</i>! Suva<i>h</i>! By offspring may I become rich in offspring! By valiant sons, rich in valiant sons! By splendour, rich in splendour! By wealth, rich in wealth! By wisdom, rich in wisdom! By pupils, rich in holy lustre!'</p>  
 <p>And (again the formulas),</p>  
 <p>'Bhû<i>h</i>! I place thee in the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i>as, in Agni, on the earth, in voice, in the Brahman, N.N.!</p>  
 <p>'Bhuva<i>h</i>! I place thee in the Ya<i>g</i>us, in Vâyu, in the air, in breath, in the Brahman, N.N.!</p>  
 <p>'Suva<i>h</i>! I place thee in the Sâmans, in Sûrya, in heaven, in the eye, in the Brahman, N.N.!</p>  
 <p>'May I be beloved (?) and dear to thee, N.N.!</p>

 <p>14. <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">14</font></a> He then seizes with his right hand (the boy's) right hand together with the thumb, with the five sections, 'Agni is long-lived.'</p>  
 <p>15. 'May (Agni) bestow on thee long life everywhere' (Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. I, 3, 14, 4)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_505"></a><a href="sbe30048.htm#fr_505">151:8</a> The word which I have translated 'draws . . . towards himself' is the same which is also used in the sense of 'he initiates him' (upanayate). Possibly we should correct the text: dakshi<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> bâhum anv abhyâtmam upanayate, 'he turns him towards himself from left to right (literally, following his right arm).'

 <p><a name="fn_509"></a><a href="sbe30048.htm#fr_509">152:13</a> The reading of the last Mantra is doubtful. Ish<i>t</i>atas should possibly be ish<i>t</i>as, but the genitive analasya, or, as some of the MSS. have, ana<i>l</i>asya (read, analasasya?), points rather to a genitive like i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>atas.
