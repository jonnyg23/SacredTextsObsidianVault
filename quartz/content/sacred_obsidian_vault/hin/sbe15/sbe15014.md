 <p>1. 'There is a town with eleven <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a> gates belonging to the Unborn (Brahman), whose thoughts are never crooked. He who approaches it, grieves no more, and liberated (from all bonds of ignorance) becomes free. This is that.'</p>  
 <p>2. 'He (Brahman) <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the swan (sun), dwelling in the bright heaven; he is the Vasu (air), dwelling in the sky; he is the sacrificer (fire), dwelling on the hearth; he is the guest (Soma), dwelling in the sacrificial jar; he dwells in men, in gods (vara), in the sacrifice (<i>ri</i>ta), in heaven; he is born in the water, on earth, in the sacrifice (<i>ri</i>ta), on the mountains; he is the True and the Great.'</p>  
 <p>3. 'He (Brahman) it is who sends up the breath (prâ<i>n</i>a), and who throws back the breath (apâna). All the Devas (senses) worship him, the adorable (or the dwarf), who sits in the centre.'</p>

 <p>8. 'He, the highest Person, who is awake in us while we are asleep, shaping one lovely sight after another, that indeed is the Bright, that is Brahman, that alone is called the Immortal.
