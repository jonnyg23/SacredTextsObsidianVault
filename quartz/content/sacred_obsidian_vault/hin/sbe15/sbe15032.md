 <p>1. After having taught the Veda, the teacher instructs the pupil: 'Say what is true! Do thy duty! Do not neglect the study of the Veda! After having brought to thy teacher his proper reward, do not cut off the line of children! Do not swerve from the truth! Do not swerve from duty! Do not neglect what is useful! Do not neglect greatness! Do not neglect the learning and teaching of the Veda!</p>  
 <p>2. 'Do not neglect the (sacrificial) works due to the Gods and Fathers! Let thy mother be to thee like unto a god! Let thy father be to thee like unto a god! Let thy teacher be to thee like unto a god! Let thy guest be to thee like unto a god! Whatever actions are blameless, those should be regarded, not others. Whatever good works have been performed by us, those should be observed by thee,--</p>  
 <p>3. 'Not others. And there are some Brâhma<i>n</i>as better than we. They should be comforted by thee by giving them a seat. Whatever is given should be given with faith, not without faith,--with joy, with modesty, with fear, with kindness. If there should</p>

 <p>4. 'In that case conduct thyself as Brâhma<i>n</i>as who possess good judgment conduct themselves therein, whether they be appointed or not <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">1</font></a>, as long as they are not too severe, but devoted to duty. And with regard to things that have been spoken against, as Brâhma<i>n</i>as who possess good judgment conduct themselves therein, whether they be appointed or not, as long as they are not too severe, but devoted to duty,</p>  
 <p>(1-7) Thus conduct thyself 'This is the rule. This is the teaching. This is the true purport (Upanishad) of the Veda. This is the command. Thus should you observe. Thus should this be observed.'</p>
