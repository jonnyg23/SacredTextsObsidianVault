 <p>THIS Upanishad is called the Pra<i>s</i><i>ñ</i>a or Sha<i>t</i>-pra<i>s</i><i>ñ</i>a-upanishad, and at the end of a chapter we find occasionally iti pra<i>s</i><i>ñ</i>aprativa<i>k</i>anam, i.e. thus ends the answer to the question. It is ascribed to the Atharva-veda, and occasionally to the Pippalâda-<i>s</i>âkhâ, one of the most important <i>s</i>âkhâs of that Veda. Pippalâda is mentioned in the Upanishad as the name of the principal teacher.</p>  
 <p><i>S</i>aṅkara, in the beginning of his commentary, says:</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Mantroktasyârthasya vistarânuvâdidam Brâhma<i>n</i>am ârabhyate, which would mean 'this Brâhma<i>n</i>a is commenced as more fully repeating what has been declared in the Mantra.' This, however, does not, I believe, refer to a Mantra or hymn in the Atharva-veda-samhitâ, but to the Mu<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-upanishad, which, as written in verse, is sometimes spoken of as a Mantra, or Mantropanishad. This is also the opinion of Ânandagiri, who says, I one might think that it was mere repetition (punarukti), if the essence of the Self, which has been explained by the Mantras, were to be taught here again by the Brâhma<i>n</i>a.' For he adds, 'by the Mantras "Brahma devânâm," &amp;c.,' and this is evidently meant for the beginning of the Mu<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-upanishad, 'Brahmâ devânâm.' Ânandagiri refers again to the Mu<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka in order to show that the Pra<i>s</i><i>ñ</i>a is not a mere repetition, and if <i>S</i>aṅkara calls the beginning of it a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, this must be taken in the more general sense of 'what is not Mantra <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' Mantropanishad is a name used of several Upanishads which are written in verse, and some of which, like the Î<i>s</i>â, have kept their place in the Sa<i>m</i>hitâs.</p>
