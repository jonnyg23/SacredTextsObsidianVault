 <p>1. Then Kausalya Â<i>s</i>valâyana asked: 'Sir, whence is that Prâ<i>n</i>a (spirit) born? How does it come into this body? And how does it abide, after it has divided itself? How does it go out? How does it support what is without <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and how what is within?'</p>  
 <p>2. He replied: 'You ask questions more difficult, but you are very fond of Brahman, therefore I shall tell it you.</p>  
 <p>3. This Prâ<i>n</i>a (spirit) is born of the Self. Like the shadow thrown on a man, this (the prâ<i>n</i>a) is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></a></p>  
 <p>spread out over it (the Brahman) <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">1</font></a>. By the work of the mind <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">2</font></a> does it come into this body.</p>  
 <p>4. As a king commands officials, saying to them: Rule these villages or those, so does that Prâ<i>n</i>a (spirit) dispose the other prâ<i>n</i>as, each for their separate work.</p>  
 <p>5. The Apâna (the down-breathing) in the organs of excretion and generation; the Prâ<i>n</i>a himself dwells in eye and ear, passing through mouth and nose. In the middle is the Samâna <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">3</font></a> (the on-breathing); it carries what has been sacrificed as food equally (over the body), and the seven lights proceed from it.</p>  
 <p>6. The Self <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">4</font></a> is in the heart. There are the 101 arteries, and in each of them there are a hundred (smaller veins), and for each of these branches there are 72,000 <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">5</font></a>. In these the Vyâna (the back-breathing) moves.</p>

 <p>7. Through one of them, the Udâna (the out-breathing) leads (us) upwards to the good world by good work, to the bad world by bad work, to the world of men by both.</p>  
 <p>8. The sun rises as the external Prâ<i>n</i>a, for it assists the Prâ<i>n</i>a in the eye <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The deity that exists in the earth, is there in support of man's Apâna (down-breathing). The ether between (sun and earth) is the Samâna (on-breathing), the air is Vyâna (back-breathing).</p>  
 <p>9. Light is the Udâna (out-breathing), and therefore he whose light has gone out comes to a new birth with his senses absorbed in the mind.</p>  
 <p>10. Whatever his thought (at the time of death) with that he goes back to Prâ<i>n</i>a, and the Prâ<i>n</i>a, united with light <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">2</font></a>, together with the self (the <i>g</i>îvâtmâ) leads on to the world, as deserved.</p>  
 <p>11. He who, thus knowing, knows Prâ<i>n</i>a, his offspring does not perish, and he becomes immortal. Thus says the <i>S</i>loka:</p>  
 <p>12. He who has known the origin <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the entry, the place, the fivefold distribution, and the internal state <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the Prâ<i>n</i>a, obtains immortality, yes, obtains immortality.'</p>

Samâna is here supposed to be between prâ<i>n</i>a and apâna, and to distribute the food equally, samam, over the body. The seven lights are explained as the two eyes, the two ears, the two nostrils, and the mouth.</p>

Ânandagiri makes the sum total, 72 ko<i>t</i>is, 72 lakshas, six thousands, two hundred and one, where the six of the thousands seems to be a mistake for da<i>s</i>asahasram. In the B<i>ri</i>hadâr.
