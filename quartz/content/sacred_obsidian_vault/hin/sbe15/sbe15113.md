 <p>1. Then the Saint <i>S</i>âkâyanya, well pleased, said to the King: 'Great King B<i>ri</i>hadratha, thou banner of the race of Ikshvâku, quickly obtaining a knowledge of Self, thou art happy, and art renowned by the name of Marut, the wind <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">1</font></a>. This indeed is thy Self <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_942"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>'Which <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="#fn_943"><font size="1">3</font></a>, O Saint,' said the King.</p>  
 <p>Then the Saint said to him:</p>  
 <p>2. 'He <a name="fr_947"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">4</font></a> who, without stopping the out-breathing <a name="fr_948"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">5</font></a>, proceeds upwards (from the sthûla to the sûkshma <i>s</i>arîra), and who, modified (by impressions), and yet not modified <a name="fr_949"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">6</font></a>, drives away the darkness (of error), he is the Self. Thus said the Saint Maitri <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">7</font></a>.' And <i>S</i>âkâyanya said to the King B<i>ri</i>hadratha: 'He who in perfect rest, rising from this body (both from the sthûla and sûkshma), and reaching the highest</p>

 <p>light <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">1</font></a>, comes forth in his own form, he is the Self <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_949"><font size="1">2</font></a> (thus said <i>S</i>âkâyanya); this is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>3. 'Now then this is the science of Brahman, and the science of all Upanishads, O King, which was told us by the Saint Maitri <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_950"><font size="1">3</font></a>. I shall tell it to thee:</p>  
 <p>'We hear (in the sacred records) that there were once the Vâlakhilyas <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_951"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who had left off all evil, who were vigorous and passionless. They said to the Pra<i>g</i>âpati Kratu: "O Saint, this body is without intelligence, like a cart. To what supernatural being belongs this great power by which such a body has been made intelligent? Or who is the driver? What thou knowest, O Saint, tell us that <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_952"><font size="1">5</font></a>."' Pra<i>g</i>âpati answered and said:</p>  
 <p>4. 'He who in the Sruti is called "Standing above," like passionless ascetics <a name="fr_956"></a><a href="#fn_953"><font size="1">6</font></a> amidst the objects of the world, he, indeed, the pure, clean, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless, bodiless <a name="fr_957"></a><a href="#fn_954"><font size="1">7</font></a>, endless, imperishable, firm, everlasting, unborn, independent one, stands in his own greatness, and by him has this body been made intelligent, and he is also the driver of it.'</p>

 <p><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="green">p. 292</font></a></p>  
 <p>They said: 'O Saint, How has this been made intelligent by such a being as this which has no desires <a name="fr_958"></a><a href="#fn_955"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and how is he its driver?' He answered them and said:</p>  
 <p>5. 'That Self which is very small, invisible, incomprehensible, called Purusha, dwells of his own will here in part <a name="fr_959"></a><a href="#fn_956"><font size="1">2</font></a>; just as a man who is fast asleep awakes of his own will <a name="fr_960"></a><a href="#fn_957"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And this part (of the Self) which is entirely intelligent, reflected in man (as the sun in different vessels of water), knowing the body (kshetra<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a), attested by his conceiving, willing, and believing <a name="fr_961"></a><a href="#fn_958"><font size="1">4</font></a>, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati (lord of creatures), called Vi<i>s</i>va. By him, the intelligent, is this body made intelligent, and he is the driver thereof.'</p>  
 <p>They said to him: 'O Saint <a name="fr_962"></a><a href="#fn_959"><font size="1">5</font></a>, if this has been made intelligent by such a being as this, which has no desires, and if he is the driver thereof, how was it?' He answered them and said:</p>  
 <p>6. 'In the beginning Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the lord of creatures) stood alone. He had no happiness, when alone. Meditating <a name="fr_963"></a><a href="#fn_960"><font size="1">6</font></a> on himself, he created many</p>

 <p>creatures. He looked on them and saw they were, like a stone, without understanding, and standing like a lifeless post. He had no happiness. He thought, I shall enter <a name="fr_964"></a><a href="#fn_961"><font size="1">1</font></a> within, that they may awake. Making himself like air (vâyu) <a name="fr_965"></a><a href="#fn_962"><font size="1">2</font></a> he entered within. Being one, he could not do it. Then dividing himself fivefold, he is called Prâ<i>n</i>a, Apâna, Samâna, Udâna, Vyâna. Now that <a name="fr_966"></a><a href="#fn_963"><font size="1">3</font></a> air which rises upwards, is Prâ<i>n</i>a. That which moves downwards, is Apâna. That by which these two are supposed to be held, is Vyâna. That <a name="fr_967"></a><a href="#fn_964"><font size="1">4</font></a> which carries the grosser material of food to the Apâna, and brings the subtler material to each limb, has the name Samâna. [After these (Prâ<i>n</i>a, Apâna, Samâna) comes the work of the Vyâna, and between them (the Prâ<i>n</i>a, Apâna, and Samâna on one side and the Vyâna on the other) comes the rising of the Udâna.] That which brings up or carries down <a name="fr_968"></a><a href="#fn_965"><font size="1">5</font></a> what has been drunk and eaten, is the Udâna <a name="fr_969"></a><a href="#fn_966"><font size="1">6</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Now the Upâ<i>m</i>su-vessel (or prâ<i>n</i>a) depends on the Antaryâma-vessel (apâna) and the Antaryâma-vessel</p>

This heat is the purusha (person), and this purusha is Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara. And thus it is said elsewhere <a name="fr_972"></a><a href="#fn_969"><font size="1">3</font></a>: "Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the fire within man by which the food that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise is that which one hears, if one covers one's ears. When a man is on the point of departing this life, he does not hear that noise."</p>  
 <p>Now he <a name="fr_973"></a><a href="#fn_970"><font size="1">4</font></a>, having divided himself fivefold, is hidden in a secret place (buddhi), assuming the nature of mind, having the prâ<i>n</i>as as his body, resplendent, having true concepts, and free like ether <a name="fr_974"></a><a href="#fn_971"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Feeling even thus that he has not attained his object, he thinks from within the interior of the heart <a name="fr_975"></a><a href="#fn_972"><font size="1">6</font></a>, "Let me enjoy objects." Therefore, having first broken open these five apertures (of the senses), he enjoys the objects by means of the five reins. This means that these perceptive organs (ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose) are his reins; the active organs (tongue (for speaking), hands, feet, anus, generative organ) his horses; the body his chariot, the mind the charioteer, the whip being the temperament. Driven by that whip, this body goes round like the</p>

 <p>wheel driven by the potter. This body is made intelligent, and he is the driver thereof.</p>  
 <p>This <a name="fr_976"></a><a href="#fn_973"><font size="1">1</font></a> is indeed the Self, who seeming to be filled with desires, and seeming to be overcome <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_974"><font size="1">2</font></a> by bright or dark fruits of action, wanders about in every body (himself remaining free). Because he is not manifest, because he is infinitely small, because he is invisible, because he cannot be grasped, because he is attached to nothing, therefore he, seeming to be changing, an agent in that which is not (prak<i>ri</i>ti), is in reality not an agent and unchanging. He is pure, firm, stable, undefiled <a name="fr_978"></a><a href="#fn_975"><font size="1">3</font></a>, unmoved, free from desire, remaining a spectator, resting in himself Having concealed himself in the cloak of the three qualities he appears as the enjoyer of <i>ri</i>ta, as the enjoyer of <i>ri</i>ta (of his good works).'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_945"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_948">290:5</a> One might read âvish<i>t</i>ambhanena, in the sense of while preventing the departure of the vital breath, as in the B<i>ri</i>h. Âr. VI, 3, prâ<i>n</i>ena rakshann avaram kulâyam.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_946"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_949">290:6</a> M. reads vyathamâno 'vyathamânas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_947"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_950">290:7</a> M. leaves out Maitri<i>h</i>-ity eva<i>m</i> hyâha. The commentator explains Maitrir by mitrâyâ apatyam <i>ri</i>shir maitrir maitreya. In a later passage (II, 3) M. reads Bhagavatâ Maitre<i>n</i>a, likewise the Anubhûtiprakâ<i>s</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_948"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_951">291:1</a> M. adds svaya<i>m</i> gyotir upasampadya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_949"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_952">291:2</a> M. reads esha for ity esha, which seems better.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_950"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_953">291:3</a> M. reads Maitre<i>n</i>a vyâkhyâtâ.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_952"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_955">291:5</a> M. adds: brûhîti te ho<i>k</i>ur Bhagavan katham anena vâsya<i>m</i> yat Bhagavan vetsy etad asmâka<i>m</i> brûhîti tân hovâ<i>k</i>eti.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_953"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_956">291:6</a> The commentator allows ûtrdhvaretasasa<i>h</i> to be taken as a vocative also.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_954"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_957">291:7</a> Nirâtmâ is explained by the commentator as thoughtless, without volition, &amp;c. But âtmâ is frequently used for body also, and this seems more appropriate here. M., however, reads anî<i>s</i>âtmâ, and this is the reading explained in the Anubhûtiprakâ<i>s</i>a, p. 228, ver. 60. This might mean the Âtman which has not yet assumed the quality of a personal god. See VI, 28; VI, 31.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_955"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_958">292:1</a> The reading anish<i>th</i>ena is explained by the commentator as free from any local habitation or attachment. He also mentions the various readings anish<i>t</i>ena, free from wishes, and anish<i>th</i>ena, the smallest. M. reads ani<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ena, and this seems better than anish<i>t</i>ena. The Anubhûtiprakâ<i>s</i>a reads likewise ani<i>k</i><i>kh</i>asya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_956"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_959">292:2</a> I read buddhipûrvam, and again with M. suptasyeva buddhipûrvam. I also read a<i>m</i>sena without iti, as in M. The simile seems to be that a man, if he likes, can wake himself at any time of night, and this 'if he likes' is expressed by buddhipûrvam. See Anubhûtiprakâ<i>s</i>a, vv. 67, 68.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_957"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_960">292:3</a> M. reads vibodhayati, atha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_958"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_961">292:4</a> See Maitr. Up. V, 2; Cowell's Translation, pp. 246, 256; Vedântaparibhâshâ, ed. A. Venis, in the Pandit, IV, p. 100.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_959"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_962">292:5</a> M. adds: bhagavann îd<i>ri</i><i>s</i>asya katham a<i>m</i><i>s</i>ena vartanam iti tân hovâ<i>k</i>a.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_964"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_967">293:4</a> M. reads: yo 'ya<i>m</i> sthavish<i>th</i>am anna<i>m</i> dhâtum annasyâpâne sthâpayaty a<i>n</i>ish<i>th</i>a<i>m</i> <i>k</i>âṅge 'ṅge sa<i>m</i>nayati esha vâva sa samâno 'tha yo 'yam. Leaving, out annam, this seems the right reading. The whole sentence from uttaram to udânasya is left out in M.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_966"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_969">293:6</a> The views of these five kinds of wind differ considerably. Here the commentator explains that the prâ<i>n</i>a and apâna, the up-breathing and down-breathing, keep the bodily warmth alive, as bellows keep up a fire. The food cooked in it is distributed by the Samâna, so that the coarse material becomes ordure, the middle flesh, the subtle material mind (manas). The udâna brings up phlegm, &amp;c., while the Vyâna gives strength to the whole body.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_967"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_970">294:1</a> Two sacrificial vessels (graha) placed on either side of the stone on which the Soma is squeezed, and here compared to the Prâ<i>n</i>a and Apâna, between which the Self (<i>k</i>aitanyâtmâ) assumes heat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_968"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_971">294:2</a> M. reads tayor antarâ<i>l</i>e <i>k</i>aush<i>n</i>yam prâsuvat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_969"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_972">294:3</a> See B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka Up. V, 9; <i>Kh</i>ând. Up. III, 13, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_970"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_973">294:4</a> The Vai<i>s</i>vânara or purusha, according to the commentator, but originally the Pra<i>g</i>âpati, who had made himself like air, and divided himself into five vital airs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_971"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_974">294:5</a> Thus the âtmâ, with his own qualities and those which he assumes, becomes a living being.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_972"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_975">294:6</a> M. reads esho 'sya h<i>ri</i>dantare tish<i>th</i>ann.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_973"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_976">295:1</a> M. reads: Sa vâ esha âtmeti ho<i>s</i>ann iva sitâsitai<i>h</i>. This seems better than u<i>s</i>anti kavaya<i>h</i>, which hardly construes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_974"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_977">295:2</a> M. reads abhibhûyamânay iva, which again is better than anabhibhûta iva, for he seems to be overcome, but is not, just as he seems to be an agent, but is not. See also III, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_975"></a><a href="sbe15113.htm#fr_978">295:3</a> M. has alepo.</p>
