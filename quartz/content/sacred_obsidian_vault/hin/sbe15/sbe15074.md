 <p>1. <i>G</i>anaka Vaideha, descending from his throne, said: 'I bow to you, O Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya, teach me.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Your Majesty, as a man who wishes to make a long journey, would furnish himself with a chariot or a ship, thus is your mind well</p>  
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>furnished by these Upanishads <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">1</font></a>. You are honourable, and wealthy, you have learnt the Vedas and been told the Upanishads. Whither then will you go when departing hence?'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'Sir, I do not know whither I shall go.'</p>  
 <p>Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'Then I shall tell you this, whither you will go.'</p>  
 <p><i>G</i>anaka Vaideha said: 'Tell it, Sir.'</p>  
 <p>2. Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya said: 'That person who is in the right eye <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he is called Indha, and him who is Indha they call indeed <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">3</font></a> Indra mysteriously, for the gods love what is mysterious, and dislike what is evident.</p>  
 <p>3. 'Now that which in the shape of a person is in the right eye, is his wife, Virâ<i>g</i> <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Their meeting-place <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">5</font></a> is the ether within the heart, and their food the red lump within the heart. Again, their covering <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">6</font></a> is that which is like net-work within the heart, and the road on which they move (from sleep to waking) is the artery that rises upwards from the heart. Like a hair divided into a thousand parts, so are the veins of it, which are called Hita <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">7</font></a>, placed</p>

 <p>firmly within the heart. Through these indeed that (food) flows on flowing, and he (the Tai<i>g</i>asa) receives as it were purer food <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">1</font></a> than the corporeal Self (the Vai<i>s</i>vânara).</p>  
 <p>4. 'His (the Tai<i>g</i>asa's) Eastern quarter are the prâ<i>n</i>as (breath) which go to the East;</p>  
 <p>'His Southern quarter are the prâ<i>n</i>as which go to the South;</p>  
 <p>'His Western quarter are the prâ<i>n</i>as which go to the West;</p>  
 <p>'His Northern quarter are the prâ<i>n</i>as which go to the North;</p>  
 <p>'His Upper (Zenith) quarter are the prâ<i>n</i>as which go upward;</p>  
 <p>'His Lower (Nadir) quarter are the prâ<i>n</i>as which go downward;</p>  
 <p>'All the quarters are all the prâ<i>n</i>as. And he (the Âtman in that state) can only be described by No <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">2</font></a>, no! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended; he is undecaying, for he cannot decay; he is not attached, for he does not attach himself; he is unbound, he does not suffer, he does not perish. O <i>G</i>anaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness,'--thus said Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>G</i>anaka said: 'May that fearlessness come to you also who teachest us fearlessness. I bow to you. Here are the Videhas, and here am I (thy slave).'</p>
