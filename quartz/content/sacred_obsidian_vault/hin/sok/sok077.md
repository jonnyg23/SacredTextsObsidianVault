 <p>III. 48. <i>tû surat nain nihâr</i></p> 
 <p>OPEN your eyes of love, and see Him who pervades this world I consider it well, and know that this is your own country.<br> When you meet the true Guru, He will awaken your heart;<br> He will tell you the secret of love and detachment, and then you will know indeed that He transcends this universe. <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a><br> This world is the City of Truth, its maze of paths enchants the heart:<br> We can reach the goal without crossing the road, such is the sport unending.<br> Where the ring of manifold joys ever dances about Him, there is the sport of Eternal Bliss.<br> When we know this, then all our receiving and renouncing is over;<br> Thenceforth the heat of having shall never scorch us more.</p> 
 <p>He is the Ultimate Rest unbounded:<br> He has spread His form of love throughout all the world.<br> From that Ray which is Truth, streams of new forms are perpetually springing: and He pervades those forms.<br> All the gardens and groves and bowers are abounding with blossom; and the air breaks forth into ripples of joy. <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a><br> There the swan plays a wonderful game,<br> There the Unstruck Music eddies around the Infinite One;<br> There in the midst the Throne of the Unheld is shining, whereon the great Being sits--<br> Millions of suns are shamed by the radiance of a single hair of His body.<br> On the harp of the road what true melodies are being sounded! and its notes pierce the heart:<br> There the Eternal Fountain is playing its endless life-streams of birth and death.<br> They call Him Emptiness who is the Truth of truths, in Whom all truths are stored!</p> 
 <p>There within Him creation goes forward, which is beyond all philosophy; for philosophy cannot attain to Him: <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a><br> There is an endless world, O my Brother! and there is the Nameless Being, of whom naught can be said.<br> Only he knows it who has reached that region: it is other than all that is heard and said.<br> No form, no body, no length, no breadth is seen there: how can I tell you that which it is?<br> He comes to the Path of the Infinite on whom the grace of the Lord descends: he is freed from births and deaths who attains to Him.<br> Kabîr says: "It cannot be told by the words of the mouth, it cannot be written on paper:<br> It is like a dumb person who tastes a sweet thing--how shall it be explained?"</p>
