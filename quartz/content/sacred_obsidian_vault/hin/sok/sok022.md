 <p>II. 33. <i>ghar ghar dîpak barai</i></p> 
 <p>LAMPS burn in every house, O blind one! and you cannot see them.<br> One day your eyes shall suddenly be opened, and you shall see: and the fetters of death will fall from you.<br> There is nothing to say or to hear, there is nothing to do: it is he who is living, yet dead, who shall never die again.</p> 
 <p>Because he lives in solitude, therefore the Yogi says that his home is far away. <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></a><br> Your Lord is near: yet you are climbing the palm-tree to seek Him.<br> The Brâhman priest goes from house to house and initiates people into faith:<br> Alas! the true fountain of life is beside you., and you have set up a stone to worship.<br> Kabîr says: "I may never express how sweet my Lord is. Yoga and the telling of beads, virtue and vice--these are naught to Him."</p>
