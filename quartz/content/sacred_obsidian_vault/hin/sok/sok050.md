 <p>I. 105. <i>jo dîsai, so to hai nâhî<u>n</u></i></p> 
 <p>THAT which you see is not: and for that which is, you have no words.<br> Unless you see, you believe not: what is told you you cannot accept.<br> He who is discerning knows by the word; and the ignorant stands gaping. <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></a><br> Some contemplate the Formless, and others meditate on form: but the wise man knows that Brahma is beyond both.<br> That beauty of His is not seen of the eye: that metre of His is not heard of the ear.<br> Kabîr says: "He who has found both love and renunciation never descends to death."</p>
