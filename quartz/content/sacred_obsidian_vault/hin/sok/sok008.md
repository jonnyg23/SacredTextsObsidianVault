 <p>I. 85. <i>Sâdho, Brahm alakh lakhâyâ</i></p> 
 <p>WHEN He Himself reveals Himself, Brahma brings into manifestation That which can never be seen.<br> As the seed is in the plant, as the shade is in the tree, as the void is in the sky, as infinite forms are in the void--<br> So from beyond the Infinite, the Infinite comes; and from the Infinite the finite extends.</p> 
 <p>The creature is in Brahma, and Brahma is in the creature: they are ever distinct, yet ever united.<br> He Himself is the tree, the seed, and the germ. <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a><br> He Himself is the flower, the fruit, and the shade.<br> He Himself is the sun, the light, and the lighted.<br> He Himself is Brahma, creature, and Maya.<br> He Himself is the manifold form, the infinite space;<br> He is the breath, the word, and the meaning.<br> He Himself is the limit and the limitless: and beyond both the limited and the limitless is He, the Pure Being.<br> He is the Immanent Mind in Brahma and in the creature.</p> 
 <p>The Supreme Soul is seen within the soul,<br> The Point is seen within the Supreme Soul,<br> And within the Point, the reflection is seen again. <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a><br> Kabîr is blest because he has this supreme vision!</p>
