 <p>II. 87. <i>Kabîr kab se bhaye vairâgî</i></p> 
 <p>GORAKHNATH asks Kabîr:<br> "Tell me, O Kabîr, when did your vocation begin? Where did your love have its rise?"<br> Kabîr answers:<br> "When He whose forms are manifold had not begun His play: when there was no Guru, and no disciple: when the world was not spread out: when the Supreme One was alone--<br> Then I became an ascetic; then, O Gorakh, my love was drawn to Brahma.<br> Brahma did not hold the crown on his head; the god Vishnu was not <a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a> anointed as king; the power of Shiva was still unborn; when I was instructed in Yoga.</p> 
 <p>I became suddenly revealed in Benares, and Râmânanda illumined me;<br> I brought with me the thirst for the Infinite, and I have come for the meeting with Him.<br> In simplicity will I unite with the Simple One; my love will surge up.<br> O Gorakh, march thou with His music!"</p>
