 <p>II. 56. <i>dariyâ kî lahar dariyâo hai jî</i></p> 
 <p>THE river and its waves are one<br> surf: where is the difference between the river and its waves?<br> When the wave rises, it is the water; and when it falls, it is the same water again. Tell me, Sir, where is the distinction?<br> Because it has been named as wave, shall it no longer be considered as water?</p> 
 <p>Within the Supreme Brahma, the worlds are being told like beads:<br> Look upon that rosary with the eyes of wisdom.</p>
