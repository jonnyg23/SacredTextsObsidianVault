 <p>2. But there is (a scriptural statement of the origination of ether).</p>  
 <p>The conjunction 'but' indicates the adoption of another alternative.--The origin of ether may not be stated in the <i>Kh</i>ândogya; but it <i>is</i> stated in other scriptural passages. For the text of the Taittirîyakas, after having introduced Brahman as the general subject-matter,--in the words, 'The true, knowledge, without end is Brahman,'--goes on to say, 'From that Self sprang ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 1).--Hence there arises a conflict of scriptural passages, the creation sometimes being said to begin with fire, sometimes with ether.--But may we not appropriately assume the two scriptural passages to form one syntactical whole?--It would be well indeed if we could do so, but a unity of the kind desired cannot be admitted, because the creator who is mentioned only once--in the passage 'he sent forth fire'--cannot be connected with two things to be created, as if the construction were 'He sent forth fire, he sent forth ether.'--But--an objection may be raised--we see that sometimes an agent, although^ mentioned once only, is yet</p>

 <p>connected with two objects; as when we say 'after having cooked broth he now cooks rice.' We therefore may combine the two scriptural sentences into one, 'Brahman having created ether created fire.'--Such a combination of sentences, we reply, is not admissible here, because the <i>Kh</i>ândogya intimates that fire was created first, while the Taittirîyaka assigns the same position to ether, and because it is impossible that both should have been created first.--The same remarks apply to a further contradiction involved in the other scriptural passage, 'From that Self sprang ether,' &amp;c.; for there also the material cause and the fact of origination, being mentioned only once, cannot he connected with fire as well as ether, so as to effect a sentence of the following kind, 'from that there sprang ether, from that there sprang fire.' Moreover the Taittirîyaka states separately that 'fire (sprang) from air <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">1</font></a>."--With regard to this conflict of statements somebody now maintains the following view.</p>
