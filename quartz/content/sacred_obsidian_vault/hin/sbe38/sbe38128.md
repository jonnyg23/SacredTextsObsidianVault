 <p>25. And as in the case of (physical) light and the like, there is non-distinction (of the two Selfs), the light (i.e. the intelligent Self) (being divided) by its activity; according to the repeated declarations of scripture.</p>  
 <p>As light, ether, the sun and so on appear differentiated as it were through their objects such as fingers, vessels, water and so on which constitute limiting adjuncts <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">2</font></a>, while in reality they preserve their essential non-differentiatedness; so the distinction of different Selfs is due to limiting adjuncts only, while the unity of all Selfs is natural and original. For on the doctrine of the non-difference of the individual soul and the highest Self the Vedânta-texts insist again and again. <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

The 'karma<i>n</i>i,' which is <a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 173</font></a> as good as passed over by him, is explained by Go. Ân. as 'dhyânâdikarma<i>n</i>y upâdhau.' Ân.
