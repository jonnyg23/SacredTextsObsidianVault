 <p>15. Moreover there are seven (hells).</p>  
 <p>Moreover, the purâ<i>n</i>a-writers record that there are seven hells, Raurava, &amp;c., by name, which serve as abodes of enjoyment of the fruits of evil deeds. As those who do not sacrifice, &amp;c. go there, how should they reach the moon?--But, an objection is raised, the assertion that evil doers suffer punishments allotted by Yama is contradicted by the circumstance that Sm<i>ri</i>ti mentions different other beings, such as <i>K</i>itragupta, &amp;c., who act as superintendents in Raurava and the other hells.--This objection the next Sûtra refutes.</p>
