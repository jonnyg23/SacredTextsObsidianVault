 <p>38. And the promotion (of knowledge is bestowed on them) through special acts.</p>  
 <p>Also for widowers, &amp;c., the favour of knowledge is possible through special acts of duty, such as praying, fasting, propitiation of divinities, &amp;c., which are not opposed to their â<i>s</i>rama-less condition and may be performed by any man as such. Thus Sm<i>ri</i>ti says, 'By mere prayer no doubt the Brâhma<i>n</i>a perfects himself. May he perform other works or not, the kindhearted one is called Brâhma<i>n</i>a (Manu Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 87), which passage shows that where the works of the â<i>s</i>ramas are not possible prayer qualifies for knowledge. Moreover knowledge may be promoted by â<i>s</i>rama works performed in previous births. Thus Sm<i>ri</i>ti also declares, 'Perfected by many births he finally goes the highest way' (Bha. Gîtâ VI, 45); which passage shows that the aggregate of the different purificatory ceremonies performed in former births promotes knowledge.--Moreover knowledge--as having a seen result (viz. the removal of ignorance)--qualifies any one who is desirous of it for learning and so on, through the mere absence of obstacles <a name="fr_201"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Hence there is no contradiction in admitting qualification for knowledge on the part of widowers and the like.</p>
