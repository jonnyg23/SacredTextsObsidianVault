 <p>56. Or else there is no contradiction (implied in our opinion); as in the case of mantras and the like.</p>  
 <p>Or else we may put the matter as follows. There is no reason whatever to suspect a contradiction if we declare certain vidyâs enjoined in one <i>S</i>âkhâ to be valid for the udgîtha and so on belonging to other <i>S</i>âkhâs also; for there is no more room for contradiction than in the case of mantras. We observe that mantras, acts, and qualities of acts which are enjoined in one <i>S</i>âkhâ are taken over by other <i>S</i>âkhâs also. So e.g. the members of certain Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda <i>S</i>âkhâs do not exhibit in their text the mantra, 'Thou art the ku<i>t</i>aru <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">1</font></a>', which accompanies the taking of the stone (with which the rice-grains are ground); all the same we meet in their text with the following injunction of application, 'Thou art the cock, with this mantra he takes the stone; or else with the mantra, Thou art the ku<i>t</i>aru.'</p>

 <p>Again, the text of some <i>S</i>âkhâ does not contain a direct injunction of the five offerings called prayâ<i>g</i>as which are made to the fuel and so on, but it contains the injunction of secondary matters connected with the prayâ<i>g</i>as, viz. in the passage, 'the seasons indeed are the prayâ<i>g</i>as; they are to be offered in one and the same spot <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="sbe38200.htm#fn_171"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'--Again, the text of some <i>S</i>âkhâ does not contain an injunction as to the species of the animal to be sacrificed to Agnîshomau--such as would be 'a he-goat is sacrificed to Agnîshomau <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="sbe38200.htm#fn_172"><font size="1">2</font></a>;'--but in the same <i>S</i>âkhâ we meet with a mantra which contains the required specification, 'Hot<i>ri</i>', recite the anuvâkyâ, for the fat of the omentum of the he-goat <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="sbe38200.htm#fn_173"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' Similarly mantras enjoined in one Veda only, such as 'O Agni, promote the hautra, promote the sacrifice,' are seen to be taken over into other Vedas also. Another example (of the transference of mantras) is supplied by the hymn, 'He who as soon as born showed himself intelligent,' &amp;c. (<i>Ri</i><i>k</i>. Sa<i>m</i>h. II, 12), which although read in the text of the Bahv<i>ri</i>kas is employed in the Taittirîya Veda also, according to Taitt. Sa<i>m</i>h. VII, 5, 5, 2, 'The Sa<i>g</i>anîya hymn is to be recited.'--Just as, therefore, the members of sacrificial actions on which certain vidyâs rest are valid everywhere, so the vidyâs themselves also which rest on those members are valid for all <i>S</i>âkhâs and Vedas.</p>
