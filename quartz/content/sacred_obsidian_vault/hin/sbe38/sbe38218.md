 <p>In reply to the averment made in Sûtra 3, we point out that there are declarations of scripture, of equal weight, in favour of the view that knowledge is not complementary to action.

'Thus far goes immortality. Having said so Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya went away into the forest' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 5, 15). With reference to the indicatory sign (as to the dependence of knowledge to work) which is implied in the passage, 'Sirs, I am going to perform a sacrifice,' we remark that it belongs to a section which treats of Vai<i>s</i>vânara. Now, the text may declare that a vidyâ of Brahman as limited by adjuncts is accompanied by works; but all the same the vidyâ does not stand in a subordinate relation to works since 'leading subject-matter' and the other means of proof are absent.</p>  
 <p>We now reply to the averment made in Sûtra 4.</p>
