 <p>alone is all this' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'The Self is all this' (<i>Kh</i>. Up. VII, 25, 2): 'In it there is no diversity' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'He to whom there is nothing superior, from whom there is nothing different' (<i>S</i>vet. Up. III, 9); 'This is the Brahman without cause and without effect, without anything inside or outside' (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 5, 19).--And that there is no other Self within the highest Self, follows from that scriptural passage which teaches Brahman to be within everything (B<i>ri</i>. Up. II, 5, 19).</p>
