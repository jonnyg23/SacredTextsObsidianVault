Haradatta explains the term 'avara,' translated by 'men of later ages,' to mean 'men like ourselves' (asmadâdi). In his comment on the parallel passage of Âpastamba be renders it by idânîntana, 'belonging to our times;' and in his notes on Âpastamba I, 2, 5, 4, he substitutes arvâ<i>k</i>îna kaliyugavartin, 'men of modern times living in the Kaliyuga.' The last explanation seems to me the most accurate, if it is distinctly kept in mind that in the times of Gautama the Kaliyuga was not a definite period of calculated duration, but the Iron Age of sin as opposed to the happier times when justice still dwelt on earth.</p>

The above translation follows the reading of my MSS. mu<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>g</i>a<i>t</i>ila<i>s</i>ikhâ<i>g</i>a<i>t</i>â vâ, which seems more in accordance with the Sûtra style. It must, however, be understood that the arrangement of the hair is not regulated by the individual choice of the student, but by the custom of his family, school, or country. In the commentary, as given by one of my MSS., it is stated the custom of shaving the whole head prevailed among the <i>Kh</i>andogas. Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 53; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_814"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_815">178:28</a> The above translation agrees with Professor Stenzler's text and Manu V, 143. But according to Haradatta the meaning of. the Sûtra is not so simple. His explanation is as follows: 'If while holding things in his hands he becomes impure, i.e. he is defiled by urine, fæces, leavings of food, and the like (impurities) which are causes for sipping water, then he shall sip water after placing those things on the ground. This refers to uncooked food, intended to be eaten. And thus Vasish<i>th</i>a (III, 4, 3, Benares edition) declares: "If he who is occupied with eatables touches any impure substance, then he shall place that thing on the ground, sip water, and afterwards again use it." But the following text of another Sm<i>ri</i>ti, "A substance becomes pure by being sprinkled with water after having been placed on the ground," refers to cooked food, such as boiled rice and the like. Or (the above Sûtra may mean), "If he becomes impure while holding things in his hands, then he shall sip water without laying them on the ground." And thus Manu (V, 143) says: "He who carries in any manner anything in his hands and is touched by an impure substance shall cleanse himself by sipping water without laying his burden down." This rule refers to things not destined to be eaten, such as garments. And in the (above) Sûtra the words, "He who becomes impure shall sip water," must be taken as one sentence, and (the whole), " If while holding things in his hands he becomes impure, <a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a> he shall sip water without laying (them) down," must be taken as a second.'</p>  
 <p>Though it may be doubted if the yogavibhâga, or ' division of the construction,' proposed by Haradatta, is admissible, still it seems to me not improbable that Gautama intended his Sûtra to be taken in two different ways. For, if according to the ancient custom it is written without an Avagraha and without separating the words joined by Sandhi, dravyabasta u<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ish<i>t</i>onidhâyâ<i>k</i>âmet, the latter group may either stand for u<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ish<i>t</i>o nidhâya â<i>k</i>âmet or for u<i>k</i><i>kh</i>is<i>t</i>o anidhâya â<i>k</i>âmet. As the Sûtra-kâras aim before all things at brevity, the Sûtra may have to be read both ways. If that had to be done, the correct translation would be: 'If while holding things in his hands, be becomes impure, he shall (purify himself by) sipping water, either laying (his burden) down (or) not laying it down, (as the case may require.)'</p>

The purification of these two is the same as that of wood, i.e. by scraping (or planing). How is it proper that, since the author has declared (Sûtra 29) that objects made of wood shall be purified by planing, the expression "like wood" should be substituted (in this Sûtra)? (The answer is that), as the author uses the expression "like wood," when he ought to have said "like objects made of wood," he indicates thereby that the manner of purification is the same for the material as for the object made thereof.'--Haradatta. The <a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180</font></a> Sûtra is, therefore, a so-called <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>apaka, intended to reveal the existence of a general rule or paribhâshâ which has not been given explicitly.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_818"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_819">180:32</a> 'Scattering over, i.e. heaping on (earth) after bringing it from another spot is an additional method of purifying earth. With regard to this matter Vasish<i>th</i>a (III, 57) says: "Earth is purified by these four (methods, viz.) by digging, burning scraping, being trodden on by cows, and, fifthly, by being smeared with cowdung."'--Haradatta.</p>  
 <p>What Haradatta and probably Gautama mean, is that the mud floors of houses, verandahs, and spots of ground selected for sitting on, if defiled, should be scraped, and that afterwards fresh earth should be scattered over the spot thus cleansed. See, however, Manu V, 125, who recommends earth for the purification of other things also. The Sûtra may also be interpreted so as to agree with his rule. </p>
 <p><a name="fn_819"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_820">180:33</a> 'Chips (vidala), i.e. something made of chips of ratan-cane or bamboo, or, according to others, something made of feathers.'--Haradatta.</p>

For the explanation of the expression 'very much' Haradatta refers to Vasish<i>th</i>a III, 58, with which Manu V, 123 may be compared.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_821"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_822">180:35</a> 'The alternative (position) depends on the pleasure of the performer.'--Haradatta.</p>

 <p><i>a</i>. 'How many times? Three times or four times; the alternative <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a> depends upon the pleasure of the performer. Another (commentator says): When, according to a special rule of the Vedas the sipping must be accompanied by the recitation of sacred texts, then the act shall be repeated four times, else three times.'--Haradatta.</p>  
 <p><i>b</i>. The custom of touching the lips twice is noted as the opinion of some, by Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 4.</p>  
 <p><i>c</i>. '"Sprinkle his feet and." On account of the word "and" he shall sprinkle his head also.'--Haradatta.</p>  
 <p><i>d</i>. '"Touch the cavities, &amp;c." Here the word "and" indicates that each organ is to be touched separately.'--Haradatta. Regarding the manner of touching, see Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 5 and 7 note.</p>  
 <p><i>e</i>. '"(And finally) place," &amp;c. Because the word "and" is used, he shall touch the navel and the head with all the fingers'--Haradatta. Regarding the whole Â<i>k</i>amanakalpa, see Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 1 seq.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_826"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_827">181:40</a> 'As the author ought to have said, "If they become detached, <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a> he is purified by merely swallowing them," the addition of the words "he should know" and "as in the case of saliva" is intended to indicate that in the case of saliva, too, he becomes pure by swallowing it, and that purification by sipping need not be considered necessary.'--Haradatta. This Sûtra consists of the second half of a verse, quoted by Baudhâyana I, 5, 8, 25, and Vasish<i>th</i>a III, 41.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_828"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_829">182:42</a> In explanation of the term amedhya, 'unclean substances,' Haradatta quotes Manu V, 135.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_832"></a><a href="sbe0265.htm#fr_833">182:46</a> This and the following rules refer chiefly to the teaching of the Sâvitrî, which forms part of the initiation.

After the initiation follows the study of the Sâvitrî. The touching of the organs of sense and the other (acts mentioned) form part of this (study). But the rules prescribed in the three Sûtras, the first of which is Sûtra 52, and the rule to direct the eye and mind towards the teacher (Sûtra 47), must be constantly kept in mind.

The commentator adds that the somewhat different rule, given by Manu IV, 126, may be reconciled with the above, by referring the former to the study for the sake of remembering texts recited by the teacher (dhâra<i>n</i>âdhyayana), and the latter to the first instruction in the sacred texts.</p>
