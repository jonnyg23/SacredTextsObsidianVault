 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_573">111:1</a> <b>5</b>. This rule refers to the Upâkarma, to be performed yearly by householders. In our days, too, the custom is observed, and the whole Brahminical community change on this occasion their <i>G</i>envîs or sacrificial cords in the month of Srâva<i>n</i>a. The adherents of the various <i>S</i>âkhâs of the Vedas, however, perform the ceremony on different days. According to Haradatta, the Upanishads are named, in order to show that they are of the highest importance. See also <i>S</i>atapatha-brâhma<i>n</i>a X, 3, 5, 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_574">111:2</a> Others consider that this Sûtra refers to the annual Upâkarma of the householder. In that case the translation would be, 'And after having performed the Upâkarma,' &amp;c. Probably Âpastamba means to give a general rule, applicable both to householders and to students who have returned home.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_575">112:4</a> 'Though he may suspect that the teacher had been defiled by the touch of a <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla or the like, still he shall not show disgust nor wash himself.'--Haradatta. Regarding the rule of receiving guests, see below, II, 4, 8, 6 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_576">112:6</a> According to Haradatta, the repetition of the word â<i>k</i>âryam, 'the teacher,' in this Sûtra, indicates that the rule holds good not only when the teacher comes as a guest to his former pupil, but on every occasion when he receives water for sipping.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_576"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_577">112:7</a> 'He is called samudeta, "possessed of all (good qualities) together," who is endowed with (good) birth, disposition, behaviour, (great) learning, and a (venerable) age.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_577"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_578">112:8</a> The word syât is to be understood from Sûtra 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_578"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_579">113:13</a> Haradatta states that 'speaking evil' is forbidden here once more in order that it should be particularly avoided.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_579"></a><a href="sbe0240.htm#fr_580">113:14</a> 'For example, he shall not say, "The <a href="errata.htm#0"><i>Ri</i><i>g</i>-veda</a> is sweet to the ear, the other Vedas grate on the ear," or "the Taittirîya-veda is a <i>S</i>âkhâ consisting of leavings," or "the Brâhma<i>n</i>a proclaimed by Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya is of modern origin."'--Haradatta. The second sentence refers to the story that Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya vomited the Black Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, and his fellow-students, becoming partridges, picked it up. Regarding the third sentence, see Vârttika on Pâ<i>n</i>ini IV, 3, 105, and Max Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, P. 363.</p>
