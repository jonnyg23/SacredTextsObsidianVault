 <p>A Brâhma<i>n</i>a declares: Since a devout student takes away from women, who refuse (to give him alms, the merit gained) by (<i>S</i>rauta)-sacrifices, by gifts, (and) by burnt-offerings (offered in the domestic fire), as well as their offspring, their cattle, the sacred learning (of their families), therefore, indeed, (a woman) should not refuse (alms) to the crowd of students; for amongst those (who come to beg), there might be one of that (devout) kind, one who thus (conscientiously) keeps his vow.</p>  
 <p>27. Alms (shall) not (be considered) leavings (and be rejected) by inference from their appearance), but on the strength of ocular or oral testimony (only). <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall beg, prefacing (his request) by the word 'Lady'; <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. A Kshatriya (inserting the word) 'Lady' in the middle (between the words 'give alms');</p>  
 <p>30. A Vai<i>s</i>ya, adding the word 'Lady' (at the end of the formula).</p>  
 <p>31. (The pupil) having taken those (alms) shall place them before his teacher and offer them to him. <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">31</font></a></p>

 <p>33. If the teacher is absent, the pupil (shall offer the food) to (a member of) the teacher's family.</p>  
 <p>34. If the (family of the teacher) is (also) absent, the pupil (may offer the food) to other learned Brâhma<i>n</i>as (<i>S</i>rotriyas) also (and receive from them the permission to eat). <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">34</font></a></p>

 <p>36. After he has eaten, he himself shall clean his dish. <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">36</font></a></p>

 <p>38. If he cannot (eat all that he has taken in his dish), he shall bury (the remainder) in the ground;</p>  
 <p>39. Or he may throw it into the water;</p>  
 <p>40. Or he may place (all that remains in a pot), and put it down near an (uninitiated) Ârya; <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">40</font></a></p>  
 <p>41. Or (he may put it down) near a <i>S</i>ûdra slave (belonging to his teacher).</p>

 <p>a part of the alms into the fire and eat (the remainder).</p>  
 <p>43. Alms are declared to be sacrificial food. In regard to them the teacher (holds the position which) a deity (holds in regard to food offered at a sacrifice).</p>  
 <p>44. And (the teacher holds also the place which) the Âhavanîya fire occupies (at a sacrifice, because a portion of the alms is offered in the fire of his stomach). <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">44</font></a></p>

Haradatta: 'Apapâtras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &amp;c. are unfit for the use of the four castes. . . . Since Âpastamba says, In the evening and in the morning, food obtained in the evening must not be used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the morning for the evening meal."'

 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="sbe0206.htm#fr_163">12:31</a> The words with which be announces the alms are, Idam ittham âh<i>ri</i>tam, 'this much have I received.' Manu II, 51; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 2, 7; Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>. Sû. I, 22, 10.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="sbe0206.htm#fr_165">13:34</a> Regarding the term <i>S</i>rotriya, see below, II, 3, 6. 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_165"></a><a href="sbe0206.htm#fr_166">13:35</a> 'The meaning of this Sûtra is, that the rule given, Sûtra 42 (below), for a pupil who is on a journey, shall hold good also for a pupil who is at home, if (in the absence of his teacher) no <i>S</i>rotriyas are to be found (from whom he can receive the permission to eat).'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="sbe0206.htm#fr_167">13:36</a> 'He commits no sin, if he has the alms-pot cleaned by somebody else. Some say that the Sûtra refers to both vessels (the alms-pot and his own dish).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="sbe0206.htm#fr_168">13:40</a> An Ârya is a person belonging to one of the first three castes (see below). The Ârya must be a boy who is not initiated, because children are kâmabhakshâ<i>h</i>, i.e. allowed to eat what they like, even leavings.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="sbe0206.htm#fr_169">13:42</a> This rule holds good if no <i>S</i>rotriyas are near. If <i>S</i>rotriyas are to be found, Sûtra 34 applies. Agni, the god of fire, is considered to be of the Brahminical caste, and hence he takes the place of the teacher or of the <i>S</i>rotriyas.
