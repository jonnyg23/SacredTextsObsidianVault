 <p>1. (The lawful occupations common) to (all) twice-born men are studying the (Veda), offering sacrifices (for their own sake), and giving (alms). <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. Teaching, performing sacrifices for others, and receiving alms (are) the additional (occupations) of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. But the former (three) are obligatory (on him). <a name="fr_1090"></a><a href="#fn_1089"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. Instruction in the Veda (may be given) without the above-mentioned (vows and ceremonies) in case a teacher, blood relations, friends or Gurus (receive it), and in case (the Veda) is exchanged for money or learning. <a name="fr_1091"></a><a href="#fn_1090"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p>6. Likewise lending money at interest.</p>

 <p>13. And (to take) measures for ensuring victory (is another duty of a king), <a name="fr_1097"></a><a href="#fn_1096"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. Especially when danger (from foes threatens the kingdom);</p>

 <p>18. Excepting those who have lost their horses, charioteers, or arms, those who join their hands (in supplication), those who flee with flying hair, those who sit down with averted faces, those who have climbed (in flight) on eminences or trees, messengers, and those who declare themselves to be cows or Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>  
 <p>19. If another Kshatriya is supported by (the king), he shall follow the same occupations as his (master).</p>

 <p>22. And a preferential share, except when the booty has been gained in single combat. <a name="fr_1101"></a><a href="#fn_1100"><font size="1">22</font></a></p>  
 <p>23. But the king shall equitably divide (all) other (spoils).</p>

 <p>25. Some declare, that (there is a tax) also on cattle and gold, (viz.) one-fiftieth (of the stock). <a name="fr_1103"></a><a href="#fn_1102"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. In the case of merchandise one-twentieth (must be paid by the seller) as duty, <a name="fr_1104"></a><a href="#fn_1103"><font size="1">26</font></a></p>

 <p>28. For it is the duty (of the king) to protect the (tax-payers). <a name="fr_1106"></a><a href="#fn_1105"><font size="1">28</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. But to (the collection of) these (taxes) he shall always pay particular attention. <a name="fr_1107"></a><a href="#fn_1106"><font size="1">29</font></a></p>

Haradatta says that some believe the term 'twice-born' to have been used in order to indicate that the three occupations may be lawfully followed after the second birth, i.e. the initiation only. But he declares that alms may be given even by an uninitiated Âryan, while studying the Veda and sacrificing are specially forbidden to him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1088"></a><a href="sbe0274.htm#fr_1089">227:2</a> Âpastamba II, 5, 10, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1089"></a><a href="sbe0274.htm#fr_1090">227:3</a> Manu X, 76. The former, i.e. the three beginning with studying (Sûtra 1), must necessarily be followed. If he neglects them, he commits sin; if he follows them, he will be exalted. But the other occupations, teaching, &amp;c., shall be followed if there is occasion for them. No sin is committed by neglecting them, nor any greatness gained by following them. They are merely means of livelihood.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1090"></a><a href="sbe0274.htm#fr_1091">227:4</a> Âpastamba I, 4, 13, 15-18. The expression 'above-mentioned' refers to the whole of the rules regarding a pupil's conduct given above, I, 52-II, 51. It is difficult to understand what is intended by 'the exchange of the Veda for wealth or money,' if it is not the bh<i>ri</i>takâdhyâpana or teaching for money which Manu III, 156 blames so severely. It seems to me unlikely that Gautama means simply to sanction this practice. It is more probable that his rule refers to the case of Brâhma<i>n</i>as in distress, who avail themselves of the permission given above, VII, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1091"></a><a href="sbe0274.htm#fr_1092">228:5</a>-6. These rules which allow Brâhma<i>n</i>as to be gentlemen farmers and sleeping partners in mercantile or banking firms, managed by Vai<i>s</i>yas, do not occur in other Sm<i>ri</i>tis. But they agree with the practice followed at present in many parts of India, and the praise bestowed in Vedic works on those who present land to Brâhma<i>n</i>as as well as the numerous ancient land grants show that from early times many Brâhma<i>n</i>as were holders of land, which, as a rule, was cultivated by <i>S</i>ûdras.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1094"></a><a href="sbe0274.htm#fr_1095">228:11</a> Haradatta takes this Sûtra differently. He says: 'The immunity from taxes which has been granted to Brâhma<i>n</i>as and others by former kings he shall maintain in the same manner as formerly! But I think that 'akara' must be taken as a Bahuvrîhi compound, and is used to designate widows, orphans, ascetics, &amp;c.; see Âpastamba II, 10, 26, 10-7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1095"></a><a href="sbe0274.htm#fr_1096">228:12</a> Haradatta observes that others explain upakurvâ<i>n</i>a, 'temporary students,' opposed to naish<i>th</i>ika, 'permanent students,' to mean 'men who benefit the people,' i.e. physicians and the like.</p>

Persons who declare themselves to be cows or Brâhma<i>n</i>as become inviolable on account of the sacred character of the beings they personate. Historical instances are narrated where conquered kings were forced to appear before their victors, holding grass in their mouths or dancing like peacocks in order to save their lives.</p>

He says, 'Adhika, "additional," means the money which is paid on account of (the additional occupations) which have been explained above (Sûtra 7 seq.) "To protect all created beings," &amp;c. Thereon shall he live, he himself, his servants, his elephants, horses, and his other (animals).' If this explanation is adopted, the Sûtra ought to be translated thus, 'He shall live on (the taxes paid for his) additional (occupations).' It seems, however, more probable that Gautama means to say that the king shall live on the surplus which remains after providing for the external and internal security of the kingdom, and that his object is to forbid the application of the whole revenue to the personal expenses of the ruler.</p>

But I am inclined to consider it spurious: first, because there is no proper commentary; secondly, because the enumeration of the Sa<i>m</i>skâras given here does not agree with <a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 233</font></a> that given above, VIII, 14; and thirdly, because, according to the practice of Gautama, this Sûtra should begin with 'tasyâpi' instead of with 'Sûdrasyâpi,' and the 'tasyâpi' in the next would become superfluous. The rule agrees however with Manu X, 63, 127.</p>
