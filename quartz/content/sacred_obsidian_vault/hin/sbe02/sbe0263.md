 <p><a name="fn_780"></a><a href="sbe0263.htm#fr_781">168:1</a> <b>28</b>. This Sûtra shows that the system of leasing land against a certain share of the crops, which now prevails generally in Native States, and is not uncommon in private contracts on British territory, was in force in Âpastamba's times.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_781"></a><a href="sbe0263.htm#fr_782">168:2</a> See Colebrooke, Digest, Book III, Text lxviii, for this Sûtra and the following two. Another commentator, quoted by Haradatta, connects this Sûtra with the preceding, and refers it to a poor lessee of land, who cannot pay the value of the crop which was lost through his negligence. A third explanation refers the Sûtra to a cultivator who neglects to till his land. <i>G</i>agannâtha's authorities, the <i>K</i>intâma<i>n</i>i and Ratnâkara, agree with Haradatta's first explanation.</p>
