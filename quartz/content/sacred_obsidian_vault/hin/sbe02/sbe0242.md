 <p>1. This reception of guests is an everlasting (<i>S</i>rauta)-sacrifice offered by the householder to Pra<i>g</i>âpati. <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. The fire in the stomach of the guest (represents) the Âhavanîya, (the sacred fire) in the house of the host represents the Gârhapatya, the fire at which the food for the guest is cooked (represents) the fire used for cooking the sacrificial viands (the Dakshi<i>n</i>âgni). <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. He who eats before his guest consumes the food, the prosperity, the issue, the cattle, the merit which his family acquired by sacrifices and charitable works.</p>  
 <p>4. Food (offered to guests) which is mixed with milk procures the reward of an Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sacrifice. Food mixed with clarified butter procures the reward of an Ukthya, food mixed with honey the reward of an Atirâtra, food accompanied by meat the reward of a Dvâda<i>s</i>âha, (food and) water numerous offspring and long life. <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. It is declared in the Veda, 'Both welcome and indifferent guests procure heaven (for their host).'</p>

 <p>6. When he gives food in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, (these gifts) are the Savanas (of that sacrifice offered to Pra<i>g</i>âpati). <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. When he rises after his guest has risen (to depart), that act represents the Udavasânîyâ ish<i>t</i>i (of a Vedic sacrifice). <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. When he addresses (the guest) kindly, that kind address (represents) the Dakshi<i>n</i>â. <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. When he follows (his departing guest, his steps represent) the steps of Vishnu. <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. When he returns (after having accompanied his guest), that (act represents) the Avabh<i>ri</i>tha, (the final bath performed after the completion of a sacrifice.)</p>  
 <p>11. Thus (a Brâhma<i>n</i>a shall treat) a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, (and a Kshatriya and a Vai<i>s</i>ya their caste-fellows.)</p>  
 <p>12. If a guest comes to a king, he shall make (his Purohita) honour him more than himself. <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. If a guest comes to an Agnihotrin, he himself <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>

 <p>shall go to meet him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, where didst thou stay (last night)?' (Then he offers water, saying): 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, here is water.' (Next he offers milk or the like, saying): 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may (these fluids) refresh (thee).'</p>  
 <p>14. (If the guest stays at the time of the Agnihotra, he shall make him sit down to the north of the fire and) murmur in a low voice, before offering the oblations: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy heart desires;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy will is;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy wish is;' 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy desire is.' <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">14</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. If a guest comes, after the fires have been placed (on the altar), but before the oblations have been offered, (the host) himself shall approach him and say to him: 'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows give me permission; I wish to sacrifice.' Then he shall sacrifice, after having received permission. A Brâhma<i>n</i>a declares that he commits a sin if he sacrifices without permission. <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">15</font></a></p>  
 <p>16. He who entertains guests for one night obtains earthly happiness, a second night gains the middle air, a third heavenly bliss, a fourth the world of unsurpassable bliss; many nights procure endless worlds. That has been declared in the Veda.</p>  
 <p>17. If an unlearned person who pretends to be</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> (worthy of the appellation) 'guest' comes to him, he shall give him a seat, water, and food, (thinking) 'I give it to a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a.' Thus (the merit) of his (gift) becomes (as) great (as if a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a had received it).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_593"></a><a href="sbe0242.htm#fr_594">117:2</a> in the first Sûtra the reception of guests had been compared to an everlasting Vedic sacrifice. This analog is traced further in detail in this Sûtra. One of the chief characteristics of a Vedic sacrifice is the vitâna, or the use of three sacred fires. Hence Âpastamba shows that three fires also are used in offering hospitality to guests. </p>
 <p><a name="fn_594"></a><a href="sbe0242.htm#fr_595">117:4</a> Regarding the Agnish<i>t</i>oma and the other sacrifices mentioned, see Aitareya-brâhma<i>n</i>a III, 8; IV, 1; IV, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_595"></a><a href="sbe0242.htm#fr_596">118:6</a> The morning, midday, and evening offerings offered at the great Vedic sacrifices are called Savanas. The object of this Sûtra is to prescribe the hospitable reception of guests at a times of the day, and to further describe the similarity of a guest-offering to a Vedic sacrifice.</p>
