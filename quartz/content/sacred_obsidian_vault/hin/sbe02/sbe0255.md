 <p><a name="fn_717"></a><a href="sbe0255.htm#fr_718">151:3</a> The reason why the constellation Tishya has been chosen for this rite seems to be that Tishya has another name, Pushya, i.e. 'prosperous'. This sacrifice is to begin on the Tishya-day of the month called Taisha or Pausha (December-January), and to continue for one year.</p>
