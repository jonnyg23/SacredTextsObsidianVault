 <p>4. And both (the householder and his wife) shall fast on (the days of) the new, and full moon,</p>  
 <p>5. To eat once (on those days in the morning) that also is called fasting. <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. And they may eat (at that meal) until they are quite satisfied.</p>  
 <p>7. And on (the anniversary of) that (wedding)-day they may eat that food of which they are fond. <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. And (on the night of that day) they shall sleep on the ground (on a raised heap of earth). <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>

 <p>performed has been declared by (the description of the Sthâlîpâka) to be performed on the days of the new and full moon (the Pârva<i>n</i>a).</p>  
 <p>12. And they declare (that this rite which is known) amongst the people (must be performed) every (year). <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. At every (burnt-offering), when he wishes to place the fire on the altar (called Stha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila), let him draw on that (altar) three lines from west to east and three lines from south to north, and sprinkle (the altar) with water, turning the palm of the hand downwards, and let him then make the fire burn brightly by adding (fuel). <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">13</font></a></p>  
 <p>14. He shall pour out (the remainder of) this water used for sprinkling, to the north or to the east (of the altar), and take other (water into the vessel).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_526"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_527">99:1</a> <b>1</b>. According to Haradatta, this rule is intended to refute the opinion of those who hold that the sacred household-fire may be kept, and the prescribed offerings therein may be performed, either from the time of the marriage, or after the division of the family estate. He also states that the use of the dual g<i>ri</i>hamedhino<i>h</i> indicates that husband and wife must perform the rites conjointly. Manu III, 67.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_527"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_528">99:2</a> Haradatta thinks that this Sûtra is intended to prevent householders from having more than two meals a day, and to keep them from gluttony. Others are of opinion that its object is to keep householders from excessive fasting, and to make them perform the Prâ<i>n</i>âgnihotra at either meal. At the Prâ<i>n</i>âgnihotra the sacrificer eats five mouthfuls invoking successively, whilst he <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a> eats, the five vital airs. At the first mouthful he says, 'To Prâ<i>n</i>a svâhâ;' at the second, 'To Apâna svâhâ,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_528"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_529">100:5</a> Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>. Sû. I, 10, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_529"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_530">100:7</a> Haradatta holds that the words 'on that day' do not refer to the days of the new and full moon, the Parvan-days, mentioned in Sûtra 4. His reasons are, first, that the permission to eat food, of which the householder may be particularly fond, has already been given in Sûtra 6, by the term t<i>ri</i>pi<i>h</i>, 'satisfaction'; and, secondly, that the singular 'on this day' does not agree with the plural 'on the Parvan-days.' Hence he comes to the conclusion that the words 'on that day' must refer to the wedding-day, mentioned in Sûtra 1, as well as to its anniversary. Haradatta is, probably, right in his explanation, though the reasons adduced here are very weak. A stronger reason for detaching this Sûtra from Sûtra 4 will be brought forward below, under Sûtra 11. Mahâdeva, the commentator of the Hira<i>n</i>yake<i>s</i>idharma, adopts the view rejected by Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_530"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_531">100:8</a> Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>. Sû. I, 3, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_531"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_532">100:10</a> A Sthâlîpâka is an offering at which rice cooked in a pot, sthâlî, is offered in the fire. A full description of this kind of sacrifice occurs, Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>. Sû. I, 10, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_532"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_533">100:11</a> The Pârva<i>n</i>a Sthâlîpâka has been described by Âpastamba <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a> in the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra, III, 7. Again, Haradatta returns to the question whether the words on that day (Sûtra 7) refer to the Parvan-days, or the marriage-day and its anniversaries. He now adds, in favour of the latter view, that the word Pârva<i>n</i>ena, 'by the rite to be performed on Parvan-days,' by which the Sthâlîpâka on Parvan-days is intended, clearly proves the impossibility to refer he preceding rules to the Parvan-days. He adds that some, nevertheless, adopt the explanation rejected by himself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_533"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_534">101:12</a> They, i.e. the <i>S</i>ish<i>t</i>as, those learned in the law. 'Another commentator says, the rite which will be taught (in the following Sûtra), and which is known from the usage of the learned, is constant, i.e. must be performed in every case. That it is what the "learned" declare.'--Haradatta. The latter explanation of the Sûtra is adopted by Mahâdeva.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_534"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_535">101:13</a> Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>. Sû. I, 3, 1-3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_535"></a><a href="sbe0236.htm#fr_536">101:15</a> Haradatta states that the object of the repetition of the words 'the householder and his wife' is to show that they themselves must fill the water-vessels, and not employ others for this purpose. He adds that, according to another commentator, the object of the repetition is to show that Sûtras 13 and 14 apply not only to householders, but also to students, and that hence students, when they offer the daily oblations of sacred fuel (above, I, 1, 4, 14 seq.), should also perform the rites taught in the preceding Sûtras.</p>
