 <p><a name="fn_711"></a><a href="sbe0254.htm#fr_712">149:2</a> 'Therefore those whose mothers are alive should not perform this ceremony.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_712"></a><a href="sbe0254.htm#fr_713">149:4</a> If the masculine bhoktavya<i>h</i> is used instead of bhoktavyam, the participle must be construed with <i>k</i>amasa<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_713"></a><a href="sbe0254.htm#fr_714">149:5</a> The verbum finitum, which according to the Sanskrit text ought to be taken with the participle sa<i>m</i>nayan, is grasîta, Sûtra 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_714"></a><a href="sbe0254.htm#fr_715">149:8</a> 'Why is this second alternative mentioned, as (the first Sûtra) suffices? True. But according to the maxim that "restrictions are made on account of the continuance of an action once begun," the meaning of this second Sûtra is that he shall <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a> continue to the end to handle the vessel (in that manner in which) he has handled it when eating for the first time.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_715"></a><a href="sbe0254.htm#fr_716">150:16</a> Haradatta remarks that some allow, according to II, 2, 4, 22, the sacred thread to be substituted, and others think that both the thread and the garment should be worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm.</p>
