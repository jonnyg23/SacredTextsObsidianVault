 <p>1. The murderer of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, he who drinks spirituous liquor, the violator of a Guru's bed, he who has connection with the female relatives of his mother and of his father (within six degrees) or with sisters and their female offspring, he who steals (the gold of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a), an atheist, he who constantly repeats blamable acts, he who does not cast off persons guilty of a crime causing loss of caste, and he who forsakes blameless (relatives), become outcasts, <a name="fr_1376"></a><a href="#fn_1375"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>10. Giving false evidence, calumnies which will reach (the ears of) the king, an untrue accusation brought against a Guru (are acts) equal to mortal sins (mahâpâtaka). <a name="fr_1382"></a><a href="#fn_1381"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. (The guilt of a) minor offence (upapâtaka) rests on those who (have been declared to) defile the company (at a funeral dinner and have been named above) before the bald man, on killers of kine, those who forget the Veda, those who pronounce Vedic texts for the (last-mentioned sinners), students <a name="fr_1383"></a><a href="#fn_1382"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>

 <p>13. He who forsakes (them) under any other circumstances, becomes an outcast.</p>
