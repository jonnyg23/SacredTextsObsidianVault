 <p><a name="fn_1237"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1238">255:1</a> <b>XV</b>. 'The word "now" indicates that a new topic begins.'--Haradatta. The rules now following refer in the first instance to the Pârva<i>n</i>a or monthly <i>S</i>râddha, but most of them serve also as general rules for all the numerous varieties of funeral sacrifices.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1238"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1239">255:2</a> Manu III, 122; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 217.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1241"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1242">255:5</a> Some of the most famous among the places where the performance of a <i>S</i>râddha is particularly efficacious and meritorious are Gayâ in Bihâr, Pushkara or Pokhar near Agmîr, the Kurukshetra near Dehli, Nâsika on the Godâvarî. Pilgrims or persons passing through such places may and must perform a <i>S</i>râddha on any day of the month.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1242"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1243">255:7</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya I, 227.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1243"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1244">255:8</a> See also below, Sûtra 21.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1244"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1245">255:9</a> Âpastamba II, 7, 17, 4. Haradatta explains vâk, 'eloquence,' by 'ability to speak Sanskrit,' rûpa, 'beauty,' by 'the proper number of limbs,' and vaya<i>h</i>sampanna, 'of (suitable) age,' by 'not too young.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1245"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1246">256:11</a> I.e. in honour of the father a young man is to be invited, in honour of the grandfather an old man, and in honour of the great-grandfather a very old man.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1246"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1247">256:12</a> Âpastamba II. 7, 17, 4, 8; Manu III, 140.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1247"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1248">256:15</a> Âpastamba II, 7, 16, 23-11, 7, 17, 3; 11, 8, 18, 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1248"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1249">256:16</a> Âpastamba II, 7, 17, 21. 'A destroyer of the sacred fire (vîrahan), i.e. one who extinguishes intentionally the (domestic) fire <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> out of hatred against his wife, and for the like reasons.'--Haradatta. He also remarks that some read agredidhishu instead of agredidhishû, and he proposes to explain the former, on the authority of Vyâghra and of the Naigha<i>n</i><i>t</i>ukas, as 'a Brâhma<i>n</i>a whose wife has been wedded before to another man.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1249"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1250">257:17</a> My MSS. make two Sûtras out of Professor Stenzler's one, and read upapati<i>h</i> | yasya <i>k</i>a sa<i>h</i>. The sense remains the same, but the latter version of the text is, I think, the correct one.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1250"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1251">257:18</a> Haradatta says that ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>âsin may also mean 'he who eats out of a vessel called ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>a,' as the people have in some countries the habit of preparing their food and afterwards eating out of the ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>a. Haradatta explains tyaktâtman, 'one who despairs of himself,' by 'one who has made an attempt on his own life, and has tried to hang himself, and the like.' He remarks that some explain durvâla, 'a bald man,' by nirvesh<i>t</i>ita<i>s</i>epha. He who neglects the recitation of the sacred texts, i.e. of those texts which, like the Gâyatrî, ought to be recited.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1251"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1252">258:19</a> Below, XXVIII, 2, it will be prescribed that the division of the family estate may take place during the lifetime of the father with his consent. From this Sûtra it would appear that sons could enforce a division of the ancestral estate against his will, as Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>avalkya also allows (see Colebrooke, Mitâksharâ I, 6, 5-11), and that this practice, though legal, was held to be contra bonos mores.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1252"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1253">258:20</a> Âpastamba II, 7, 17, 5-6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1253"></a><a href="sbe0279.htm#fr_1254">258:21</a> According to Haradatta, this Sûtra is intended as a modification of Sûtra 8.</p>
