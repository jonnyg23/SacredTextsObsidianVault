 <p>himself before his master and announce it to him (saying), 'It is ready.'</p>  
 <p>11. The answer (of the master) shall be, 'That well-prepared food is the means to obtain splendour; may it never fail!' <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. The burnt-oblations and Bali-offerings made with the food which the husband and his wife are to eat, bring (as their reward) prosperity, (and the enjoyment of) heaven. <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_542"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_543">104:5</a> This Sûtra is a <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>âpaka, as it indicates that Âpastamba also recognises the different rules which are usually prescribed in the Sm<i>ri</i>tis for Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshatriyas, Vai<i>s</i>yas, and <i>S</i>ûdras. See above, I, 5, 16, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_543"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_544">104:7</a> Usually in bathing both Âryas and <i>S</i>ûdras wear no dress except the lango<i>t</i>î.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_544"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_545">105:11</a> Manu II, 54.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_545"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_546">105:12</a> Balis are portions of food which are thrown before the door, or on the floor of the house. See below, Sûtra 16 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_546"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_547">105:13</a> Others explain this Sûtra thus: 'After having used for the first time these sacred formulas (which are to be recited in offering the burnt-oblation and the Balis, the householder and his wife) shall sleep,' &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_547"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_548">105:14</a> Regarding the use of ekarâtra in the sense of 'a (day and a) night,' see above. The 'last' Bali-offering is that described below, II ,2, 4, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_548"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_549">105:15</a> 'They say that the word "afterwards" is used in order to indicate that perfumes, garlands, and other (Upa<i>k</i>âras) must be, offered between (the last two acts).'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_549"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_550">106:16</a> It is a disputed point with the commentators whether every Brâhma<i>n</i>a may offer the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva in the common kitchen-fire, or those persons only who do not keep a sacred domestic fire. The six Mantras, which are given Taitt. Âr. X, 67, 1, are: 1. Agnaye svâhâ, 'to Agni svâhâ'; 2. Somâya svâhâ, 'to Soma svâhâ'; 3. Vi<i>s</i>vebhyo devebhya<i>h</i> svâhâ, 'to all the gods svâhâ'; 4. Dhruvâya bhûmaya svâhâ, 'to Dhruva Bhûma svâhâ'; 5. Dhruvakshitaye svâhâ, 'to Dhruvakshiti svâhâ'; 6. A<i>k</i>yutakshitaye svâhâ, 'to A<i>k</i>yutakshiti svâhâ.' Haradatta adds that some add a seventh formula, addressed to Agni svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, 'to the fire which causes the proper performance of the sacrifice,' while others leave out the second Mantra and give that addressed to Agni svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t the sixth place. This latter is the order given in the Calcutta edition of the Taittirîya Âra<i>n</i>yaka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_551">106:17</a> 'Above, i.e. G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtra, I, 2, 3, 8.'--Haradatta. The Mantras recited are: 1. at the first sprinkling, Adite ’numanyasva, 'Aditi permit'; Anumate ’numanyasva, 'Anumati permit'; Sarasvaty anumanyasva, 'Sarasvatî permit'; Deva Savita<i>h</i> prasuva, 'Divine Savit<i>ri</i> permit'; 2. at the second sprinkling, the same as above, anvama<i>m</i>sthâ<i>h</i> and prâsâvî<i>h</i>, 'thou hast permitted,' being substituted for anumanyasva and prasuva.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_552">106:18</a> This Sûtra is a restriction of Sûtra 15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_553">106:20</a> The first six offerings constitute the Devaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a or Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, which is offered in the fire. Now follow the Bali-offerings, which are merely placed on the ground. 'Behind the fire' means to the east of the fire'; for the sacrificer must face the east.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_554">107:21</a> The Mantra is, Adbbya<i>h</i> svâhâ, 'to the Waters svâhâ.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_554"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_555">107:22</a> The Mantras are, Osbadhivanaspatibbya<i>h</i> svâhâ, 'to the herbs and trees svâhâ'; Raksbodeva<i>g</i>anebhya<i>h</i> svâhâ, 'to the Râkshasas and the servants of the gods svâhâ.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_555"></a><a href="sbe0238.htm#fr_556">107:23</a> These four Balis are sacred to the G<i>ri</i>hâs, to the Avasânas, to the Avasânapatis, and to all creatures.</p>
