 <p>15. Endless worlds are the portion (of those householders and wives) who act thus.</p>

 <p>19. If a <i>S</i>ûdra comes as a guest (to a Brâhma<i>n</i>a), he shall give him some work to do. He may feed him, after (that has been performed). <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">19</font></a></p>

 <p>23. He shall sweep together (the crumbs) on the place where he has eaten, and take them away. He shall sprinkle water on that place, turning the palm downwards, and remove the stains (of food from the cooking-vessels with a stick), wash them with water, and take their contents to a clean place to the north (of the house, offering them) to Rudra. In this manner his house will become prosperous.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_556"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_557">107:2</a> <b>4</b>. 'Others explain dehalî', "the door-sill," to mean "the door-case."'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_557"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_558">107:3</a> 'Others explain apidhâna, "the panels of the door;" to mean "the bolt of the door."'--Haradatta. The offering is made to Nâma, 'the name, or essence of things.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_558"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_559">108:4</a> Haradatta gives two explanations of the word Brahmasadana, 'the seat of Brahman.' According to some, it is an architectural term, designating the centre of the house; according to others, it denotes the place where, at the time of the burnt-oblations, the Brahman or superintending priest is seated, i.e. a spot to the south of the sacred fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_559"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_560">108:5</a> Balis and water for the Manes are placed or poured into the palm of the hand and thrown out between the thumb and forefinger. That part of the palm is, therefore, sometimes called 'the tîrtha sacred to the Manes.' See Manu II, 39.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_560"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_561">108:6</a> 'That is to say, the sacrificial cord shall not be suspended over the right shoulder, nor shall the Bali be thrown out between the thumb and forefinger.'--Haradatta</p>
 <p><a name="fn_561"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_562">108:7</a> In sprinkling around an offering to the gods, the sacrificer turns his right hand towards the oblation and pours out the water, beginning in the south and ending in the east. In sprinkling around an offering to the Manes, exactly the opposite order is to be followed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_563">109:8</a> At night, i. e. before the evening meal. The Mantra is, 'To those beings which, being servants of Vituda, roam about day and night, desiring a Bali-offering, I offer this Bali, desirous of prosperity. May the Lord of prosperity grant me prosperity, svâhâ. Haradatta adds, that according to another commentator, no other Bali but this is to be offered in the evening, and that some modify the Mantra for each occasion, offering the Bali in the morning to the Bhûtas that roam about during the day,' and in the evening 'to the night-walkers.' Compare for the whole section Manu III, 90-92; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 102-104.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_564">109:10</a> Manu III, 94 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_565">109:11</a> Manu III, 115; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 105.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_565"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_566">109:12</a> Manu III, 114; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 105.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_567">109:14</a> Manu III, 101 Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 107. As read in the text, the first line of the verse has one syllable in excess. This irregularity would disappear if t<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â, the Vedic form of the nom. ace. plural, were read for t<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âni, and it seems to me not improbable that t<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âni is a correction made by a Pandit who valued grammatical correctness higher than correctness of metre.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_567"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_568">110:16</a> Manu III, 99.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_569">110:18</a> Manu III, 110-112; Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 107.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_571">110:20</a> 'Hence it is known that the king ought to keep stores of rice and the like in every village, in order to show hospitality to <i>S</i>ûdra guests.'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="sbe0239.htm#fr_572">111:24</a> Manu II, 241, 242. From here down to II, 3, 6, 2, Âpastamba again treats of the duties of students and teachers, a subject which appears to have in his eyes a greater importance than any other. The rules given now apply chiefly to householders. It would seem that they have been inserted in this particular place, because the reception of a former teacher is to be described II, 3, 5, 4-11, and that of a 'learned guest' II, 3, 6, 3 seq.</p>
