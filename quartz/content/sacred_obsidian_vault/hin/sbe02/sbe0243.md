 <p>1. On the second and following days of the guest's stay, the host shall not rise or descend (from his couch) in order to salute his (guest), if he has been saluted before (on the first day).</p>  
 <p>2. He shall eat after his guests. <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. He shall not consume all the flavoured liquids in the house, so as to leave nothing for guests. <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. He shall not cause sweetmeats to be prepared for his own sake. <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. (A guest) who can repeat the (whole) Veda (together with the supplementary books) is worthy to receive a cow and the Madhuparka, <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. (And also) the teacher, an officiating priest, a Snâtaka, and a just king (though not learned in the Veda).</p>  
 <p>7. A cow and the Madhuparka (shall be offered) to the teacher, to an officiating priest, to a father-in-law, and to a king, if they come after a year has elapsed (since their former visit).</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. The Madhuparka shall consist of curds mixed with honey, or of milk mixed with honey. <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. On failure (of these substances) water (mixed with honey may be used).</p>  
 <p>10. The Veda has six Aṅgas (auxiliary works). <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. (The six auxiliary works are) the Kalpa (teaching the ritual) of the Veda, the treatises on grammar, astronomy, etymology, phonetics, and metrics.</p>  
 <p>12. (If any one should contend that) the term Veda (on account of its etymology, implying that which teaches duty or whereby one obtains spiritual merit) applies to the complete collection of (works which contain) rules for rites to be performed on the authority of precepts, (that, consequently, the Kalpa-sûtras form part of the Veda, and that thereby) the number (fixed above) for those (Aṅgas) is proved to be wrong, <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">12</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. (Then we answer), All those who are learned in Mîmâ<i>m</i>sâ are agreed that (the terms Veda, Brâhma<i>n</i>a, and the like, which are applied to) the principal (works), do not include the Aṅgas (the Kalpa-sûtras and the rest). he remembers at any time during dinner,</p>  
 <p>14. If he remembers at any time that he has refused a guest, he shall at once leave off eating and fast on that day,</p>
