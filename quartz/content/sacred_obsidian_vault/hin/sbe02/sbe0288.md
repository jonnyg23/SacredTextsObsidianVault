   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>  
 <p>1. A secret penance (must be performed) by him whose sin is not publicly known. <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a></p>  
 <p>2. He who desires to accept or has accepted (a gift) which ought not to be accepted, shall recite the four <i>Ri</i>k-verses (IX, 58, 1-4), (beginning) Tarat sa mandî, (standing) in water. <a name="fr_1444"></a><a href="#fn_1443"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. He who desires to eat forbidden food, shall scatter earth (on it). <a name="fr_1445"></a><a href="#fn_1444"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. Some (declare, that) he who has connection with a woman during her courses becomes pure by bathing. <a name="fr_1446"></a><a href="#fn_1445"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. Some (declare, that this rule holds good) in the case of (one's own) wives (only). <a name="fr_1447"></a><a href="#fn_1446"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. The (secret) penance for killing a learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a (is as follows):, Living during ten days on milk (alone) or (on food fit for offerings), during a second (period of ten days) on clarified butter, and during a third (period of ten days) on water, partaking <a name="fr_1448"></a><a href="#fn_1447"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a></p>  
 <p>of (such food) once only each day, in the morning, and keeping his garments constantly wet, he shall (daily) offer (eight) oblations, (representing) the hair, the nails, the skin, the flesh, the blood, the sinews, the bones, (and) the marrow. The end of each (Mantra) shall be, 'I offer in the mouth of the Atman (the Self), in the jaws of Death.'</p>  
 <p>7. Now another (penance for the murder of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a will be described):</p>  
 <p>8. The rule (as to eating and so forth), which has been declared (above, Sûtra 6, must be observed),</p>  
 <p>9. (And) he shall offer clarified butter, reciting (the sacred text Rig-veda I, 189, 2), 'O fire, do thou ferry over,' the Mahâvyâh<i>ri</i>tis, and the Kûshmâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>as; <a name="fr_1449"></a><a href="#fn_1448"><font size="1">9</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. Or, for the murder of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a, for drinking spirituous liquor, for stealing (gold), and for the violation of a Guru's bed, he may perform that (same vow), tire himself by repeatedly stopping his breath, and recite (the hymn seen by) Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a. That is equal (in efficacy) to the final bath at a horse-sacrifice; <a name="fr_1450"></a><a href="#fn_1449"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. Or, repeating the Gâyatrî a thousand times, he, forsooth, purifies himself; <a name="fr_1451"></a><a href="#fn_1450"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>  
 <p>12. Or, thrice repeating (the hymn of) Aghamarsha<i>n</i>a while immersed in water, he is freed from all sins.</p>
