 <p>25. If lightning flashes without interruption, or, thunder rolls continually, if a man has neglected to purify himself, if he has partaken of a meal in honour of a dead person, or if hoarfrost lies on the ground, (in these cases) they forbid the mental recitation (of the daily portion of the Veda). <a name="fr_293"></a><a href="#fn_292"><font size="1">25</font></a></p>

 <p>27. Where lightning, thunder, and rain happen together out of season, the recitation shall be interrupted for three days. <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_294"><font size="1">27</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_280"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_281">40:1</a> <b>11</b>. The Black Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, to which Âpastamba belongs, is divided throughout into books called Kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>as.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_281"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_282">40:3</a> Haradatta names as such gods, Nandîsvara and Kubera. Other commentators, however, explain Manushyaprakriti by Manushyamukha, 'possessing human faces.' A similar rule occurs Gautama XVI, 34, Where a Manushyayagña is mentioned as a cause for discontinuing the recitation of the Veda. In his Commentary on Gautama, also, Haradatta is in doubt. He first refers the term to the sacraments like the Sîmantonnayana, and then adds, that some explain it to mean 'a sacrifice to gods who formerly were men.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_282"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_283">40:4</a> This Sûtra is an exception to I, 3, 10, 28.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_284">40:6</a> Haradatta's commentary on this Sûtra is very meagre, and he leaves the word anuvâkyam unexplained. I am not ccrtain that my explanation is correct. But it is countenanced by the statements of the G<i>ri</i>hya-sutras regarding the order of studying. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 132.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_285">41:7</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 145. This Sûtra is a <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>âpaka or 'such a one which indicates the existence of a rule not expressly mentioned! Above (I, 3, 9, 1) the yearly -performance of the Upâkarma and Utsarga ceremonies for the beginning and end of the Brahmanic term has been prescribed. In this Sûtra the performance of the Upakarma and Utsarga at the beginning and completion of the Pârâyana or the vow to go through a whole Veda is incidentally mentioned. Thence it may be inferred that these ceremonies must. be likewise performed on the latter occasions, though no absolute rule to this effect has been given. Such <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>âpakas are of frequent occurrence in all Sûtras, and constitute one of the chief difficulties of their interpretation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_286">41:8</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 149; Manu IV, 102, 122.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_286"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_287">41:11</a> Others explain the Sûtra thus: 'If he meets fellow-students, after they have come home from a journey, he shall not study with them on that day.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_288">42:15</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 145; Manu IV, 113.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_289">42:16</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 51; Manu IV, 120.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_290">42:20</a> According to Haradatta, Âpastamba uses the word Anuvâka in order to indicate that smaller portions of the Veda may be studied. Others think, that by Anuvâka, the Sa<i>m</i>hitâ and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a are meant, and that the study of the Aṅgas is permitted. The Vasantotsava, or spring festival, which, according to the Dramas, was, in olden times, kept all over India, falls, according to Haradatta, on the thirteenth of the first half of <i>K</i>aitra, about the beginning of April.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_290"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_291">42:21</a> 'Hence, if one has forgotten it and eaten one's breakfast, a penance, not the Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, must be performed'--Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_291"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_292">42:23</a> See Taittirîya Âra<i>n</i>yaka II, 11, 1 and 11; Â<i>s</i>v. G<i>ri</i>. Sû. III, 2, 1-2. In our days this rule is usually not observed. Brâhma<i>n</i>as mostly recite at the daily Brahmaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, 'Veda-offering,' one particular formula, which symbolically comprises the whole Veda. A few learned Brâhma<i>n</i>a friends, however, have assured me, that they still recite the whole of their <i>S</i>âkhâ every year according to this rule of Âpastamba.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_292"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_293">43:25</a> Yâ<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>. I, 149; Manu IV, 106, 120, 127; Taitt. Âr. II, 15, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_293"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_294">43:26</a> Manu IV, 109, 116.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_294"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_295">43:27</a> Manu IV, 103 and 104.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_297"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_298">44:32</a> One muhûrta = 48 minutes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_298"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_299">44:36</a> Other commentators interpret the Sûtra in a different sense. They take it to mean: 'And (luring the night (from the twelfth to the thirteenth of each half of the month, he shall not study at all, be it in or out of term).'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_299"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_300">44:37</a> 'What has been studied before, must not be studied (again) at any time in the vacation nor in the evening.'-- Haradatta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_300"></a><a href="sbe0214.htm#fr_301">44:38</a> Haradatta thinks that by 'Parishad,' Manu's and other Dharma-<i>s</i>âstras are meant. This explanation is, however, not exact. Parishad, 'assemblage,' means, in the language of the <i>S</i>âstras, either a Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>, an assemblage of learned Brahmans called together to decide some knotty point of law, or a Brahminical school, which studies a particular redaction of the Veda (see the Petersburg Dict. s. v.) The latter meaning is that applicable to this Sûtra. By 'Parishada<i>h</i>' are here intended the Vedic schools, and their writings and teaching. Gautama also says, XVI, 40. Prâtividya<i>m</i> yân smaranti smaranti, '(he shall observe the stoppages of the Veda-study) which they teach in (the writings belonging to) each of the Vedas.'</p>
