 <p>[<i>Reflecting</i>.] It is long since Maitreya went to visit Vasantasenā. And even yet he does not come.</p>  
 <p align="right">[<i>Enter Maitreya</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Confound the courtezan's avarice and her incivility! To think of her making so short a story of it! Over and over she repeats something about the affection she feels, and then without more ado she pockets the necklace. She is rich enough so that she might at least have said: "Good Maitreya, rest a little. You must not go until you have had a cup to drink." Confound the courtezan! I hope I'll never set eyes on her again. [<i>Wearily</i>.] The proverb is right. " It is hard to find a lotus-plant without a root, a merchant who never cheats, a goldsmith who never steals, a village-gathering without a fight, and a courtezan without avarice." Well, I'll find my friend and persuade him to have nothing more to do with this courtezan. [<i>He walks about until he discovers Chārudatta</i>.] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the orchard. I'll go to him. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Heaven bless you! May happiness be yours.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Looking up</i>.] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned. You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Thank you.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Tell me of your errand, my friend.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. My errand went all wrong.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. What! did she not accept the necklace?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put her lotus-tender hands to her brow, <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">1</font></a> and took it.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Then why do you say "went wrong"?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride of the four seas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before we had a bite or a drink out of it?</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Not so, my friend.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;<br> The price of confidence has no less measure.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">7</font></span></div>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped her friend the wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress, and laughed at me. And so, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall on my face before you and beg you not to have anything more to do with this courtezan. That sort of society does any amount of damage. A courtezan is like a pebble in your shoe. It hurts before you get rid of it. And one thing more, my friend. A courtezan, an elephant, a scribe, a mendicant friar, a swindler, and an asswhere these dwell, not even rogues are born.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My poverty of itself prevents me. For consider:<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The horse would gladly hasten here and there,<br>   But his legs fail him, for his breath departs.<br> So men's vain wishes wander everywhere,<br>   Then, weary grown, return into their hearts.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">8</font></span><!-- paragraph continues --></div>  
 <p>Then too, my friend:<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">If wealth is thine, the maid is thine,<br>   For maids are won by gold;<!-- paragraph continues -->  
 <p>[<i>Aside</i>. And not by virtue cold. <i>Aloud</i>.]<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p>But wealth is now no longer mine,<br>   And her I may not hold.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">9</font></span></p></div>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Looks down. Aside</i>.] From the way he looks up and sighs, I conclude that my effort to distract him has simply increased his longing. The proverb is right. "You can't reason with a lover." [<i>Aloud</i>.] Well, she told me to tell you that she would have to come here this evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with the necklace and is coming to look for something else.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.</p>  
 <p align="right">[<i>Enter Kumbhīlaka</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. Listen, good people.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The more it rains in sheets,<br>   The more my skin gets wet;<br> The more the cold wind beats,<br>   The more I shake and fret.<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10</font></span><!-- paragraph continues --></div>  
 <p>[<i>He bursts out laughing</i>.]<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p>My mistress Vasantasenā said to me "Kumbhīlaka, go and tell Chārudatta that I am coming." So here I am, on my way to Chārudatta's house. [<i>He walks about, and, as he enters, discovers Chārudatta</i>.] Here is Chārudatta in the orchard. And here is that wretched jackanapes, too. Well, I'll go up to them. What! the orchard-gate is shut? Good! I'll give this jackanapes a hint. [<i>He throws lumps of mud</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Well! Who is this pelting me with mud, as if I were an apple-tree inside of a fence?</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Doubtless the pigeons that play on the roof of the garden-house.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Wait a minute, you confounded pigeon! With this stick I'll bring you down from the roof to the ground, like an over-ripe mango. [<i>He raises his stick and starts to run</i>.]</p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Holding him back by the sacred cord</i>.] Sit down, my friend. What do you mean? Leave the poor pigeon alone with his mate.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. What! he sees the pigeon and doesn't see me? Good! I'll hit him again with another lump of mud. [<i>He does so</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Looks about him</i>.] What! Kumbhīlaka? I'll be with you in a minute. [<i>He approaches and opens the gate</i>.] Well, Kumbhīlaka, come in. I'm glad to see you.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. [<i>Enters</i>.] I salute you, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Where do you come from, man, in this rain and darkness?</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. You see, she's here.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Who's she? Who's here?</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. She. See? She.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Look here, you son of a slave! What makes you sigh like a half-starved old beggar in a famine, with your "shesheshe"?</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. And what makes you hoot like an owl with your "whowhowho"?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. All right. Tell me.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] Suppose I say it this way. [<i>Aloud</i>.] I'll give you a riddle, man.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. And I'll give you the answer with my foot on your bald spot.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. Not till you've guessed it. In what season do the mango-trees blossom?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. In summer, you jackass.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. [<i>Laughing</i>.] Wrong!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] What shall I say now? [<i>Reflecting</i>.] Good! I'll go and ask Chārudatta. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Just wait a moment. [<i>Approaching Chārudatta</i>.] My friend, I just wanted to ask you in what season the mango-trees blossom.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. You fool, in spring, in <i>vasanta</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Returns to Kumbhīlaka</i>.] You fool, in spring, in <i>vasanta</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. Now I'll give you another. Who guards thriving villages?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Why, the guard.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. [<i>Laughing</i>.] Wrong!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Well, I'm stuck. [<i>Reflecting</i>.] Good! I'll ask Chārudatta again. [<i>He returns and puts the question to Chārudatta</i>.]</p>  
 <p>Chārudatta. The army, my friend, the <i>senā</i>.</p>  
 <p>Maitreya. [<i>Comes back to Kumbhīlaka</i>.] The army, you jackass, the <i>senā</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. Now put the two together and say em fast.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Senā-vasanta.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. Say it turned around.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Turns around</i>.] Senā-vasanta.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. You fool! you jackanapes! Turn the parts of the thing around!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>Turns his feet around</i>.] Senā-vasanta.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. You fool! Turn the parts of the word around!</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. [<i>After reflection</i>.] Vasanta-senā.</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. She's here.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Then I must tell Chārudatta. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Well, Chārudatta, your creditor is here.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. How should a creditor come into my family?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Not in the family perhaps, but at the door. Vasantasenā is here.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. Why do you deceive me, my friend?</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. If you can't trust me, then ask Kumbhīlaka here. Kumbhīlaka, you jackass, come here.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] I salute you, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. You are welcome, my good fellow. Tell me, is Vasantasenā really here?</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. Yes, she's here. Vasantasenā is here.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Joyfully</i>.] My good fellow, I have never let the bearer of welcome news go unrewarded. Take this as your recompense. [<i>He gives him his mantle</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Kumbhīlaka</i>. [<i>Takes it and bows. Gleefully</i>.] I'll tell my mistress.</p>  
 <p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. Do you see why she comes in a storm like this?</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. I do not quite understand, my friend.</p>  
 <p><i>Maitreya</i>. I know. She has an idea that the pearl necklace is cheap, and the golden casket expensive. She isn't satisfied, and she has come to look for something more.</p>  
 <p><i>Chārudatta</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] She shall not depart unsatisfied.</p>
