 <p align="center">[<i>Enter a maid</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Maid</i>.</p>  
 <p>I AM sent with a message to my mistress by her mother. I must go in and find my mistress. [<i>She walks about and looks around her</i>.] There is my mistress. She is painting a picture, and putting her whole heart into it. I must go and speak to her.</p>  
 <p>[<i>Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasenā, seated, and Madanikā</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Well, girl, and then</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What do you mean?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Why, what did I say?</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. You said, "and then"</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>Puckering her brows</i>.] Oh, yes. So I did.</p>  
 <p><i>Maid</i>. [<i>Approaching</i>.] Mistress, your mother sends word that you should bathe and then offer worship to the gods.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. You may tell my mother that I shall not take the ceremonial bath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place.</p>  
 <p><i>Maid</i>. Yes, mistress.</p>  
 <p align="right">[<i>Exit</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks the questionbut what does this mean?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Tell me, Madanikā. How do I seem to you?</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart is filled with longing for somebody.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Well guessed. My Madanikā is quick to fathom another's heart.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. I am very, very glad. Yes, Kāma is indeed mighty, and</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>his great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress, is it a king, or a king's favorite, whom you worship?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Girl, I wish to love, not to worship.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth distinguished for very particular learning?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. A Brahman I should have to reverence.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously wealthy from visiting many cities?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and leave you behind, no matter how much you love him. And the separation makes you very sad.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. It isn't a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a merchant. Who is it then that the princess loves?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where Kāma's temple stands?</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Yes, mistress.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when you asked to be protected?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Well, what was his name?</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Why, he lives in the merchants quarter.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. But I asked you for his name.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name is Chārudatta.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>Joyfully</i>.] Good, Madanikā, good. You have guessed it.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] So much for that. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Mistress, they say he is poor.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan who sets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of the world.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree when its blossoms have fallen?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. That is just why we call that sort of a girl a butterfly.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Well, mistress, if you love him, why don't you go and visit him at once?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he can't make any returnno, I don't mean that, but it would be hard to see him.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. You have guessed it.</p>

 <p><i>A voice</i> <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>behind the scenes</i>. Oh, sir, a shampooer owes me ten gold-pieces, and he got away from us.

 <p><i>Gambler</i>. [<i>Examining the footprints</i>.] Here he goes. And here the tracks are lost.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. [<i>Gazes at the footprints. Reflectively</i>.] Look! The feet are turned around. And the temple hasn't any image. [<i>After a moment's thought</i>.] That rogue of a shampooer has gone into the temple with his feet turned around.</p>  
 <p><i>Gambler</i>. Let's follow him.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. All right. [<i>They enter the temple and take a good look, then make signs to each other</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Gambler</i>. What! a wooden image?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Of course not. It's stone. [<i>He shakes it with all his might, then makes signs</i>.] What do we care? Come, let's have a game. [<i>He starts to gamble as hard as he can</i>.]</p>

 <p><i>Gambler</i>. My turn, my turn!</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Not much! it's my turn.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Coming up quickly from behind</i>.] Isn't it my turn?</p>  
 <p><i>Gambler</i>. We've got our man.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. [<i>Seizing him</i>.] You jail-bird, you're caught. Pay me my ten gold-pieces.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. I'll pay you this very day.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Pay me this very minute!</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. I'll pay you. Only have mercy!</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Come, will you pay me now?</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. My head is getting dizzy. [<i>He falls to the ground. The others beat him with all their might</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. There [<i>drawing the gamblers ring</i>] you're bound by the gamblers ring.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Rises. Despairingly</i>.] What! bound by the gamblers ring? Confound it! That is a limit which we gamblers can't pass. Where can I get the money to pay him?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Well then, you must give surety.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. I have an idea. [<i>He nudges the gambler</i>.] I'll give you half, if you'll forgive me the other half.</p>  
 <p><i>Gambler</i>. All right.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>To Māthura</i>.] I'll give you surety for a half. You might forgive me the other half.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. All right. Where's the harm?</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Aloud</i>.] You forgave me a half, sir?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Yes.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>To the gambler</i>.] And you forgave me a half?</p>  
 <p><i>Gambler</i>. Yes.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Then I think I'll be going.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Pay me my ten gold-pieces! Where are you going?</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Look at this, gentlemen, look at this! Here I just gave surety to one of them for a half, and the other forgave me a half. And even after that he is dunning me, poor helpless me!</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. [<i>Seizing him</i>.] My name is Māthura, the clever swindler, and you're not going to swindle me this time. Pay up, jail-bird, every bit of my money, and this minute, too.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. How can I pay?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Sell your father and pay.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Where can I get a father?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Sell your mother and pay.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Where can I get a mother?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Sell yourself and pay.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Have mercy! Lead me to the king's highway.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Go ahead.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. If it must be. [<i>He walks about</i>.] Gentlemen, will you buy me for ten gold-pieces from this gambling-master? [<i>He sees a passer-by and calls out</i>.] What is that? You wish to know what I can do? I will be your house-servant. What! he has gone without even answering. Well, here's another. I'll speak to him. [<i>He repeats his offer</i>.] What! this one too takes no notice of me. He is gone. Confound it! I've had hard luck ever since Chārudatta lost his fortune.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Will you pay?</p>  
 <p align="justify'"><i>Shampooer</i>. How can I pay? [<i>He falls down. Māthura drags him about</i>.] Good gentlemen, save me, save me! [<i>Enter Darduraka</i>.]</p>

 <p><i>Māthura</i>. This is no time for nonsense. If you say that, you can give him the money yourself. My name is Māthura. I'm a swindler and I play a crooked game, and I'm not afraid of anybody. You are an immoral scoundrel.</p>  
 <p><i>Darduraka</i>. Who did you say was immoral?</p>

 <p><i>Darduraka</i>. My good fool, I was walking peaceably along the street, and you struck me. If you strike me to-morrow in court, then you will open your eyes.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. Yes, I'll open my eyes.</p>  
 <p><i>Darduraka</i>. How will you open your eyes?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. [<i>Opening his eyes wide</i>.] This is the way I'll open my eyes. [Darduraka throws dust in Māthura's eyes, and gives the shampooer a sign to escape. Māthura shuts his eyes and falls down. The shampooer escapes.]</p>

 <p><i>Darduraka</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] I have made an enemy of the influential gambling-master Māthura. I had better not stay here. Besides, my good friend Sharvilaka told me that a young herdsman named Aryaka has been designated by a soothsayer as our future king. Now everybody in my condition is running after him.

 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Whence are you, sir? or who are you, sir? or whose son are you, sir? or what is your business, sir? or what are you afraid of?</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Listen, madam. My birthplace is Pātaliputra, madam. I am the son of a householder. I practise the trade of a shampooer. Vasantasenā. It is a very dainty art, sir, which you have mastered.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Madam, as an art I mastered it. It has now become a mere trade.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Your answers are most disconsolate, sir. Pray continue.</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers tell tales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And when I had come here to Ujjayinī, I became the servant of a noble gentleman. Such a handsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money away, he did not boast; when he was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long story short: he was so courteous that he regarded his own person as the possession of others, and had compassion on all who sought his protection.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Who may it be that adorns Ujjayinī with the virtues which he has stolen from the object of my mistress desires?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. But to continue, sir</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that now</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. His riches have vanished?</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. I didn't say it. How did you guess it, madam?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom keep company. In the pools from which men cannot drink there is so much the more water.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. But sir, what is his name?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. Madam, who does not know the name of this moon of the whole world? He lives in the merchants quarter. He whose name is worthy of all honor is named Chārudatta.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>Joyfully rising from her seat</i>.] Sir, this house is your own. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is weary. [<i>Madanikā does as she is bid</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. [<i>Aside</i>.] What! so much honor because I mentioned Chārudatta's name? Heaven bless you, Chārudatta! You are the only man in the world who really lives. All others merely breathe. [<i>He falls at Vasantasenā's feet</i>.] Enough, madam, enough. Pray be seated, madam.</p>

 <p><i>Māthura</i>. I am ruined! I am robbed!</p>  
 <p><i>Shampooer</i>. There are the gambling-master and the gambler, looking for me. You have heard my story, madam. The rest is your affair.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Madanikā, the birds fly everywhither when the tree is shaken in which they have their nests. Go, girl, and give the gambling-master and the gambler this bracelet. And tell them that this gentleman sends it. [<i>She removes a bracelet from her arm, and gives it to Madanikā</i>.]</p>

 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. Inasmuch as these two are looking up to heaven, and sighing, and chattering, and fastening their eyes on the door, I conclude that they must be the gambling-master and the gambler. [<i>Approaching</i>.] I salute you, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. May happiness be yours.</p>

 <p>I haven't got any money. You'll have to look somewhere else.</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. You are certainly no gambler, if you talk that way. Is there any one who owes you money?</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. There is. He owes ten gold-pieces. What of him?</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. In his behalf my mistress sends you this bracelet. No, no! He sends it himself.</p>  
 <p><i>Māthura</i>. [<i>Seizing it joyfully</i>.] Well, well, you may tell the noble youth that his account is squared. Let him come and seek delight again in gambling.</p>

 <p>And that rogue of an elephant dives with his trunk and his feet and his tusks into the city of Ujjayinī, as if it were a lotus-pond in full flower.

 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>Anxiously</i>.] Oh, what carelessness, what carelessness!</p>  
 <p><i>Karnapūraka</i>. Don't be frightened. Just listen, mistress. Then, with a big piece of the broken chain dangling about him, he picked him up, picked up the monk between his tusks, and just then Karnapūraka saw him, I saw him, no, no! the slave who grows fat on my mistress' rice-cakes saw him, stumbled with his left foot over a gambler's score, grabbed up an iron pole out of a shop, and challenged the mad elephant</p>

 <p>like a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear nothing but "Hurrah, hurrah for Karnapūraka!" Then, mistress, a man touched the places where he ought to have ornaments, and, finding that he hadn't any, looked up, heaved a long sigh, and threw this mantle over me.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Find out, Karnapūraka, whether the mantle is perfumed with jasmine or not.</p>  
 <p><i>Karnapūraka</i>. Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong that I can't tell for sure.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Then look at the name.</p>  
 <p><i>Karnapūraka</i>. Here is the name. You may read it, mistress. [<i>He hands her the mantle</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>Reads</i>.] Chārudatta. [<i>She seizes the mantle eagerly and wraps it about her</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Madanikā</i>. The mantle is very becoming to her, Karnapūraka.</p>  
 <p><i>Karnapūraka</i>. Oh, yes, the mantle is becoming enough.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Here is your reward, Karnapūraka. [<i>She gives him a gem</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Karnapūraka</i>. [<i>Taking it and bowing low</i>.] Now the mantle is most wonderfully becoming.</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Karnapūraka, where is Chārudatta now?</p>  
 <p><i>Karnapūraka</i>. He started to go home along this very street.</p>
