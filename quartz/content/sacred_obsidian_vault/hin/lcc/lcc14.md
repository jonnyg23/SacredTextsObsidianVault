 <p><i>Monk</i>. [<i>Discovers the speaker. Fearfully</i>.] Heaven help me! Here is the king's brother-in-law, Sansthānaka. Just because one monk committed an offense, now, wherever he sees a monk, whether it is the same one or not, he bores a hole in his nose and drives him around like a bullock. Where shall a defenseless man find a defender? But after all, the blessèd Lord Buddha is my defender.</p>

 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Alas! That is not Vardhamānaka's voice. What does it mean? I wonder if Chārudatta was afraid that the bullocks might become weary, and so sent another man with another cart. My right eye twitches. My heart is all a-tremble. There is no one in sight. Everything seems to dance before my eyes.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Hearing the sound of wheels</i>.] The cart is here, shir.</p>

 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. Yes, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Are the bullocks here?</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. Yes, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. And are you here?</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. [<i>Laughing</i>.] Yes, master, I am here too.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Then drive the cart in.</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. By which road?</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Right here, where the wall is tumbling down.</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. Oh, master, the bullocks will be killed. The cart will go to pieces. And I, your servant, shall be killed.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. I'm the king's brother-in-law, man. If the bullocks are killed, I'll buy shome more. If the cart goes to pieces, I'll have another one made. If you are killed, there will be another driver.</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. Everything will be replacedexcept me.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Let the whole thing go to pieces. Drive in over the wall.</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. Then break, cart, break with your driver. There will be another cart. I must go and present myself to my master. [<i>He drives in</i>.] What! not broken? Master, here is your cart.</p>

 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. No, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Come, shir. Let's look at the cart. You are my teacher, shir, my very besht teacher. You are a man I reshpect, my intimate friend, a man I delight to honor. Do you enter the cart firsht.</p>  
 <p><i>Courtier</i>. Very well. [<i>He starts to do so</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Not much! Shtop! Is thish your father's cart, that you should enter it firsht? I own thish cart. I'll enter it firsht.</p>  
 <p><i>Courtier</i>. I only did what you said.</p>

 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Now I'll enter. Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave, turn the cart around.</p>

 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. [<i>Enters and looks about, then hastily gets out in terror, and falls on the courtier's neck</i>.] Oh, oh, oh! You're a dead man! There's a witch, or a thief, that's sitting and living in my bullock-cart. If it's a witch, we'll both be robbed. If it's a thief, we'll both be eaten alive.</p>  
 <p><i>Courtier</i>. Don't be frightened. How could a witch travel in a bullock-cart? I hope that the heat of the midday sun has not blinded you, so that you became the victim of an hallucination when you saw the shadow of Sthāvaraka with the smock on it.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave, are you alive?</p>  
 <p><i>Sthāvaraka</i>. Yes, sir.</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. But shir, there's a woman sitting and living in the bullock-cart. Look and shee!</p>

 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>In amazement. Aside</i>.] Oh, oh! It is that thorn in my eye, the king's brother-in-law. Alas! the danger is great. Poor woman! My coming hither proves as fruitless as the sowing of a handful of seeds on salty soil. What shall I do now?</p>  
 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. Thish old shervant is afraid and he won't look into the cart. Will you look into the cart, shir?</p>

 <p><i>Sansthānaka</i>. But shir, if a witch is living there, why aren't you robbed? And if it's a thief, why aren't you eaten alive?</p>

Well then, where shall I spread them out to dry? [<i>He looks about</i>.] Ah, here is a pile of dry leaves which the wind has blown into a heap. I'll spread them out on that. [<i>He does so</i>.] Buddha be praised! [<i>He sits down</i>.] Now I will repeat a hymn of the faith.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p>After all, what have I to do with heaven, before I have paid my debt to Vasantasenā, my sister in Buddha? She bought my freedom for ten gold-pieces from the gamblers, and since that day I regard myself as her property. [<i>He looks about</i>.] What was that? a sigh that arose from the leaves? It cannot be.<!-- paragraph continues --></p>

 <p><i>Monk</i>. Ah, there appears a woman's hand, adorned with beautiful gems. What! a second hand? [<i>He examines it with the greatest care</i>.] It seems to me, I recognize this hand. Yes, there is no doubt about it. Surely, this is the hand that saved me. But I must see for myself. [<i>He uncovers the body, looks at it, and recognizes it</i>.] It is my sister in Buddha. [<i>Vasantasenā pants for water</i>.] Ah, she seeks water, and the pond is far away. What shall I do? An idea! I will hold this robe over her and let it drip upon her. [<i>He does so. Vasantasenā recovers consciousness, and raises herself: The monk fans her with his garment</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. Who are you, sir?</p>  
 <p><i>Monk</i>. Has my sister in Buddha forgotten him whose freedom she bought for ten gold-pieces?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. I seem to remember, but not just as you say. It were better that I had slept never to waken.</p>  
 <p><i>Monk</i>. What happened here, sister in Buddha?</p>  
 <p><i>Vasantasenā</i>. [<i>Despairingly</i>.] Nothing but what is fittingfor a courtezan.</p>  
 <p><i>Monk</i>. Sister in Buddha, support yourself by this creeper <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">1</font></a> that clings to the tree, and rise to your feet. [<i>He bends down the creeper. Vasantasenā takes it in her hand, and rises</i>.]</p>  
 <p><i>Monk</i>. In yonder monastery dwells one who is my sister in the faith. There shall my sister in Buddha be restored before she returns home. You must walk very slowly, sister. [<i>He walks about and looks around him</i>.] Make way, good people, make way! This is a young lady, and I am a monk, yet my conduct is above reproach.</p>
