 This is a versified translation of the
 <cite>Caurapañcāśikā</cite>.
 This love poem of fifty stanzas was written
 by the Kasmiri poet Bilhana Kavi in the 11th century.
 The story runs that the Brahman Bilhana had a clandestine
 love affair with Princess Yaminipurnatilaka, the daughter of King Madanabhirama.
 He was discovered and Bilhana wrote this poem in prison before
 he learned whether he would be executed or banished.
 The historic outcome is unknown, which adds to the readers' suspense.
 </p>
 <p>
 Initially this poem was transmitted orally, and by the time it was
 written down, there several variations:
 the South Indian versions tend to have a happy ending, and the Northern,
 Kashmiri, recension has an open ending.
 </p>
 
 The <cite>Caurapañcāśikā</cite>
 was 'discovered' by Europeans in the nineteenth century.
 The first French edition, published in <cite>The Journal Asiatique</cite>
 of 1848, was based on one of the South Indian versions with a happy ending.
 There were several 19th century
 translations in various languages; it was suitable material for
 Romantic poets, including Sir Edwin Arnold, who produced his own (very
 loose) translation.
 In 1919, the English poet Powys Mathers produced
 this free-verse translation, titled <cite>Black Marigolds</cite>.
 This was the translation which John Steinbeck
 quotes in <cite>Cannery Row</cite>.
 A modern version worth looking for is <cite>The Secret Delights of Love</cite>,
 by Gertrude Clorius Schwebell,
 Peter Pauper Press, New York [1966]; this can be found <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&amp;an=Schwebell&amp;y=0&amp;tn=secret+delights&amp;x=0">used</a> very inexpensively.
