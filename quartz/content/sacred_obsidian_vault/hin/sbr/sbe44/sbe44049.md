 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:1">12:2:1:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, those who become initiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year cross an ocean: the Prâya<i>n</i>îya Atirâtra is a flight of steps <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for it is by means of a flight of steps that one enters (the water); and</p>

 <p>when they enter on the Prâya<i>n</i>îya Atirâtra it is just as if they were entering the ocean by a flight of steps.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:2">12:2:1:2</a></font></span>2. The <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day is (in the form of) a foothold, a shallow place <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">1</font></a>, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, they enter <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">2</font></a> (the deep water). The Abhiplava is (a spot) suitable for swimming; and so is the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya suitable for swimming.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:3">12:2:1:3</a></font></span>3. The Abhi<i>g</i>it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits, or to the neck, whence, having rested, they come out (of the water). The first Svarasâman is thigh-deep, the second knee-deep, the third knuckle-deep. The Vishuvat is a foothold (in the form of) an island. The first (Svarasâman) with reversed Sâmans is knuckle-deep, the second knee-deep, and the third thigh-deep.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:4">12:2:1:4</a></font></span>4. The Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, he enters (the deep water again). The P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya is suitable for swimming, and so is the Abhiplava, and so are the Go and Âyus, and so is the Da<i>s</i>arâtra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:5">12:2:1:5</a></font></span>5. The Mahâvrata is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested,</p>

 <p>they step out (of the water). The Udayanîya (concluding) Atirâtra is a flight of steps, for it is by a flight of steps that people step out (of the water): thus, when they perform the Udayanîya Atirâtra, it is just as if, having entered the sea by a flight of steps, they were to step out of it, by a flight of steps.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:6">12:2:1:6</a></font></span>6. Regarding this they say, 'How many Atirâtras are there in the year, how many Agnish<i>t</i>omas, how many Ukthyas, how many Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>ins, how many Sha<i>d</i>ahas?'--Two Atirâtras, a hundred and six Agnish<i>t</i>omas, and two hundred and forty Ukthyas,--thus in the case of those who perform the Svarasâmans as Ukthyas.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:7">12:2:1:7</a></font></span>7. But in the case of those who perform them as Agnish<i>t</i>omas, a hundred and twelve Agnish<i>t</i>omas, two hundred and thirty-four Ukthyas, twelve Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>ins, and sixty Sha<i>d</i>ahas. This, then, is how the year is obtained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:8">12:2:1:8</a></font></span>8. There are twelve months in the year, and their vital energy and power are the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as; and by performing the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as month by month, they obtain, in monthly portions <a name="fr_443"></a><a href="#fn_443"><font size="1">1</font></a>, that vital energy of the year.--'And how do they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth (intercalary) month?' Well, subsequent to the Vishuvat day they perform the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it Agnish<i>t</i>oma with all the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>as <a name="fr_444"></a><a href="#fn_444"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and thus indeed they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth month.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:2:1:9">12:2:1:9</a></font></span>9. Now, concerning this, <i>S</i>vetaketu Âru<i>n</i>eya,</p>

 <p>knowing this, once said, 'I am now going to get myself initiated for one year.' His father, looking at him, said, 'Knowest thou, long-lived one, the fording-footholds of the year?'--'I know them,' he replied, for, indeed, he said this as one knowing it.</p>
