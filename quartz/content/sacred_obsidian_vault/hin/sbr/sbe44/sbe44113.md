But '<i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>â<i>h</i>' also are called the eaters amongst the Fathers, and they, indeed, destroy in yonder world the good deeds of him who has had no sepulchre prepared for him: it is for them that he prepares that food, whence it is '<i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>ânna,' for '<i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>ânna' is what is mystically called '<i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>âna.'</p>

Let him make it in uneven years, since the uneven belongs to the Fathers; and under a single Nakshatra <a name="fr_1123"></a><a href="#fn_1116"><font size="1">1</font></a>, since the single Nakshatra belongs to the Fathers; and at new-moon, since the new-moon is a single Nakshatra;--for he (the Sacrificer) is a single (person); and in that all the beings dwell together during that night, thereby he obtains that object of desire which is (contained) in all Nakshatras.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:4">13:8:1:4</a></font></span>4. Let him make it in autumn, for the autumn is the Svadhâ, and the Svadhâ is the food of the Fathers: he thus places him along with food, the Svadhâ;--or in (the month of) Mâgha, thinking, 'Lest (mâ) sin (agha) be in us;'--or in summer (nidâgha), thinking, 'May thereby be removed (nidhâ) our sin (agha)!'</p>

Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, were contending in the (four) regions (quarters). The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from the regions, and, being regionless, they were overcome. Wherefore the people who are godly make their burial-places four-cornered, whilst those who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns and others <a name="fr_1124"></a><a href="#fn_1117"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (make them)</p>

 <p>round, for they (the gods) drove them out from the regions. He arranges it so as to lie between the two regions, the eastern and the southern <a name="fr_1125"></a><a href="#fn_1118"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for in that region assuredly is the door to the world of the Fathers: through the above he thus causes him to enter the world of the Fathers; and by means of the (four) corners he (the deceased) establishes himself in the regions, and by means of the other body <a name="fr_1126"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">2</font></a> (of the tomb) in the intermediate regions: he thus establishes him in all the regions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:6">13:8:1:6</a></font></span>6. Now as to the choosing of the ground. He makes it on ground inclining towards the north, for the north is the region of men: he thus gives him (the deceased) a share in the world of men; and in that respect, indeed, the Fathers share in the world of men that they have offspring; and his (the deceased man's) offspring will, indeed, be more prosperous.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:7">13:8:1:7</a></font></span>7. 'Let him make it on ground inclining towards the south,' they say, 'for the world of the Fathers inclines towards the south: he thus gives him a share in the world of the Fathers.' Let him not do so, however, for, indeed, such a one is an opening tomb, and certainly another of these (members of the dead man's family) quickly follows him in death.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:8">13:8:1:8</a></font></span>8. And some, indeed, say, 'Let him make it on a counter-cutting <a name="fr_1127"></a><a href="#fn_1120"><font size="1">1</font></a> in ground inclined towards the south, for such (a tomb) indeed becomes rising sin <a name="fr_1128"></a><a href="#fn_1121"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' But one must not do so, for indeed such (a burial place) alone becomes rising sin which one makes, on ground inclining towards the north.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:9">13:8:1:9</a></font></span>9. On any level (ground) where the waters, flowing thither from a south-easterly direction <a name="fr_1129"></a><a href="#fn_1122"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and coming to a stand-still, will, on reaching that (north-westerly) quarter, without pressing forward <a name="fr_1130"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">4</font></a>, join imperishable water <a name="fr_1131"></a><a href="#fn_1124"><font size="1">5</font></a>, on that (ground) one may make (the tomb); for, water being food, one thereby offers food to him from the front towards the back; and, water being the drink of immortality, and that region between the rising of the seven <i>Ri</i>shis <a name="fr_1132"></a><a href="#fn_1125"><font size="1">6</font></a> and the setting of the sun being the quarter of the living, one thereby bestows the drink of immortality upon the living:--and such a one, indeed, is a closing tomb; and verily what is good for the living that is also good for the Fathers.</p>

Let him make it in a pleasant (spot), in order that there should be pleasure for him; and in a peaceful (spot), in order that there should be peace for him. He must not make it either on a path, or in an open space, lest he should make his (the deceased's) sin manifest.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:11">13:8:1:11</a></font></span>11. Whilst being secluded it should have the sun shining on it from above <a name="fr_1133"></a><a href="#fn_1126"><font size="1">1</font></a>: in that it is secluded one hides his sin; and in that it has the sun shining on it from above---yonder sun being the remover of evil--he, indeed, removes the evil from him, and he also causes him to be endowed with the radiance of the sun.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:12">13:8:1:12</a></font></span>12.

If there be no beautiful objects, let there be water either at the back or on the left (north) side, for water is indeed a beautiful object; and beautiful objects, offspring, will indeed accrue to him.</p>

On such (ground) as is filled with roots, for to the Fathers belongs the (sod) filled with roots;--it is (sod) of vîri<i>n</i>a (Andropogon muricatus) and other grasses, for thus the Fathers’ share in this (earth) is not excessive <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1129"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and he also thereby makes (the deceased's) sin to be restricted <a name="fr_1137"></a><a href="#fn_1130"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:16">13:8:1:16</a></font></span>16.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:17">13:8:1:17</a></font></span>17. Now as to the order of procedure. For an Agni<i>k</i>it (builder of a fire-altar) one makes the tomb after the manner of the fire-altar; for when a Sacrificer builds a fire-altar he thereby constructs for himself by sacrifice a (new) body for yonder world; but that sacrificial performance is not complete until the making of a tomb; and when he makes the tomb of the Agni<i>k</i>it after the manner of the fire-altar, it is thereby he completes the Agni<i>k</i>ityâ.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:18">13:8:1:18</a></font></span>18. One must not make it (too) large lest he should make the sin (of the deceased) large. 'Let him make it as large as the fire-altar without wings and tail,' say some, 'for like that of the fire-altar is this his (the Sacrificer's) body.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:19">13:8:1:19</a></font></span>19. But let him rather make it just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another;--broader (varîyas) behind <a name="fr_1141"></a><a href="#fn_1134"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for what is (left) behind is offspring: he thus makes the (dead man's) offspring more excellent <a name="fr_1142"></a><a href="#fn_1135"><font size="1">3</font></a> (varîyas);--and broader on the left (north <a name="fr_1143"></a><a href="#fn_1136"><font size="1">4</font></a> or higher, uttara) side, for the later (uttara)</p>

 <p>are offspring: he thus makes the offspring more excellent. Having attended to this, he encloses it with cords twisted (and extended) in the non-sunwise way <a name="fr_1144"></a><a href="#fn_1137"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for the (sacrificial) performance connected with the Fathers is done in the non-sunwise way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:8:1:20">13:8:1:20</a></font></span>20. He then bids them cut out (the earth). He should cut it out to whatever extent he intends to raise (the sepulchral mound), but let him rather cut it out so as to be just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another. For, on the one hand <a name="fr_1145"></a><a href="#fn_1138"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Fathers are the world of plants, and amongst the roots of plants they (are wont to) hide; and, on the other <a name="fr_1146"></a><a href="#fn_1138"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (he does so) lest he (the deceased) should be separated from this (earth).</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_1111"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1118">421:2</a> The commentator is at pains to show that 'atha' here has not the force of 'thereupon'--that is after the performance of the Sarvamedha--but that of introducing a new topic ('Now, they do . . .'); and that therefore the directions about to be given are by no means intended to apply only to one who has performed the Sarvamedha, or even to the Agni<i>k</i>it, or builder of a fire-altar, but also to others.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1112"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1119">421:3</a> Yâska (Nir. III, 5) resolves this word into '<i>s</i>man' (body) + '<i>s</i>ayana' (couch); whilst Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 189, proposes 'a<i>s</i>man' (stone) + '<i>s</i>ayana' (couch). The <i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>âna; or burial-place, sepulchre, is constructed in the form of a tumulus, or grave-mound.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1113"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1120">422:1</a> Viz. the Sacrificer, the performer of the funeral rites, being the next of kin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1114"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1121">422:2</a> This is the way in which the scholiasts interpret the corresponding rule, Kâty. Sr. XXI, 3, 1 (pit<i>ri</i>mdha<i>h</i> sa<i>m</i>vatsarâsm<i>ri</i>tau), instead of 'when they do not remember it (even once) for years, he brings it about that the sin is forgotten, even in case they should remember it,' as Prof. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 351 translates the passage. For the subject of the verb 'they remember it,' Prof. Delbrück supplies 'pitara<i>h</i>,' i.e. the dead man's deceased ancestors, instead of the living people, which seems rather improbable. The comment is very corrupt, but it makes at least some allusion to 'people's talk':--na <i>s</i>ruti<i>h</i> <i>s</i>rutyabhâvas (ta<i>m</i>) tena <i>k</i>irakara<i>n</i>ena agha<i>m</i> pâpakara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> gamayati, <i>k</i>irât <i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>âna<i>m</i> kurva<i>s</i>rara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> (? kurvata<i>h</i> <i>s</i>rava<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>) <i>g</i>anavâdo<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>pi na <i>s</i><i>ri</i><i>n</i>otîty (!) artha<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1115"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1122">422:3</a> In this way Harisvâmin, as well as the scholiasts on Kâty. XXI, 3, 2, construes the clause with the next paragraph, and it is difficult to see how otherwise any satisfactory sense could be extracted from it. At the same time, it can evidently only qualify the first specification of time, as the others will apply in any case.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1116"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1123">423:1</a> That is, a lunar mansion consisting of a single star, such as <i>K</i>itrâ and Pushya (in contradistinction to such in the dual, as Punarvasû and Vi<i>s</i>âkhe, and to those in the plural number, as the K<i>ri</i>ttikâs). As regards the symbolic connection of the uneven number with the deceased ancestors, the commentator reminds us of the fact that it is the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who represent the Fathers.--The only available MS. of the commentary (Ind. Off. 149) terminates at this place.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1117"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1124">423:2</a> Yâ âsurya<i>h</i> prâ<i>k</i>yâs tvad ye tvat parima<i>n</i><i>d</i>alâni (<i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>ânâni kurvate),--Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 189, takes this in the sense of 'part of the prâ<i>k</i>ya, the âsurya<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>â<i>h</i> of them (hence probably <a name="page_424"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 424</font></a> the non-Âryan portion of them), have round <i>s</i>ma<i>s</i>âna.' J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. ii, p. 485, takes no account of the words 'tvad ye tvat.' For our rendering of these words, cp. V, 3, 2, 2 <i>s</i>ûdrâ<i>m</i>s tvad yâ<i>m</i>s tvat, '<i>S</i>ûdras and others,' or '<i>S</i>ûdras and suchlike people.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1120"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1127">425:1</a> This is meant as a literal rendering of 'pratyarsha.' What is intended thereby would seem to be either a cutting made into southward sloping ground, in such a way as to make the cut piece of ground rise towards the south, or perhaps such a part of the southward inclined ground as naturally rises towards the south. The St. Petersburg Dict. suggests 'steep bank (escarpment), or side (of a hill).' Kâty. XXI, 3, 15 (kakshe) seems also to imply some kind of hollow ground, surrounded by bushes and trees.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1122"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1129">425:3</a> It might also mean, in a south-easterly direction, but the comparison with food introduced into the mouth from the front (east) and the specification of the opposite direction evidently point to the above meaning.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1133"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1140">428:1</a> The commentator, on Kâty. XXI, 3, 20, and Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXV, 1, instances the <i>s</i>leshmântaka ('antiphlegmatic,' i.e. Cordia latifolia or myxa) and the kovidâra ('bad for splitting,' Bauhinia variegata; which, according to Stewart and Brandis, shows vertical cracks in the bark).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1134"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1141">428:2</a> The grave being constructed in such a way that the four corners lie in the direction of the four quarters, the back, or west side of the grave would really mean the side facing the north-west.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1135"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1142">428:3</a> Or, perhaps, more extended, more numerous or prosperous.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1136"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1143">428:4</a> In reality, the north means here the side facing the north-east. The side of the tumulus is to form a quadrilateral, of which the two sides intersecting each other at the north corner, are to be longer than the two which intersect at the south corner; viz. each of the <a name="page_429"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 429</font></a> former is to measure one man's length plus 9¼ aṅgulas (thumb's breadths), and each of the latter one man's length minus 9¼ aṅgulas. See comm. on Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXV, 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1137"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1144">429:1</a> That is, by twisting or spinning the strands from right to left, or contrary to the sun's course. The cord is extended round the grave from right to left (east, north, west, south) by means of pegs driven into the ground at the four corners; see <a href="sbe44116.htm#13:8:4:1">XIII, 8, 4, 1</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1138"></a><a href="sbe44113.htm#fr_1146">429:2</a> I do not see how the usual force of 'atho'--viz. that of introducing a new element or argument either analogous, or not quite conformable, to what precedes (cf. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 513)--can apply to this double use of the particle. The two 'atho' seem to introduce the reasons for his digging up the ground, and for his not digging up more than a man's size.</p>
