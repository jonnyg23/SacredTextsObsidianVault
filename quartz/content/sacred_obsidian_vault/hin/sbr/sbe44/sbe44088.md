 <p>moving (round the moveless: the lights shine in the heavens);'--the ruddy bay, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he harnesses for him, for the gaining of the heavenly world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:2">13:2:6:2</a></font></span>2. Concerning this they say, 'Surely, the sacrifice goes from him whose beast, when brought up, goes elsewhere than the vedi (altar-ground).' [Let him, therefore, mutter Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 7,] 'Singer of praise, make that horse come back to us by that path!'--the singer of praise, doubtless, is Vâyu (the wind) it is him he thereby places for him (the Sacrificer) on the other side, and so it does not go beyond that.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:3">13:2:6:3</a></font></span>3. But, indeed, fiery mettle and energy, cattle, and prosperity depart from him who offers the A<i>s</i>vamedha.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:4">13:2:6:4</a></font></span>4. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 8), 'May the Vasus anoint thee with the Gâyatra metre!' the queen consort anoints (the forepart of the unharnessed horse);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Gâyatrî also is fiery mettle: two kinds of fiery mettle he thus bestows together on him (the Sacrificer).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:5">13:2:6:5</a></font></span>5. With, 'May the Rudras anoint thee with the Traish<i>t</i>ubha metre!' the (king's) favourite wife anoints (the middle part):--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is energy: both fiery</p>  
 <p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 313</font></a></p>  
 <p>mettle and energy he thus bestows together on him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:6">13:2:6:6</a></font></span>6. With, 'May the Âdityas anoint thee with the <i>G</i>âgata metre!' a discarded wife <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">1</font></a> (of the king) anoints (the hindpart);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the <i>G</i>agatî is cattle: both fiery mettle and cattle he thus bestows together on him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:7">13:2:6:7</a></font></span>7. It is the wives <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">2</font></a> that anoint (the horse), for they to wit, (many) wives--are a form of prosperity (or social eminence): it is thus prosperity he confers on him (the Sacrificer), and neither fiery spirit, nor energy, nor cattle, nor prosperity pass away from him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:8">13:2:6:8</a></font></span>8. But even as some of the offering-material may get spilled before it is offered, so (part of) the victim is here spilled in that the hair of it when wetted comes off. When they (the wives) weave pearls (into the mane and tail) they gather up its hair. They are made of gold: the significance of this has been explained. A hundred and one pearls they weave into (the hair of) each part <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and his own self (or body) is the one hundred and first: in vital power, in the self, he establishes himself. They weave them in (each) with (one of) the (sacred utterings) relating to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, 'Bû<i>h</i>! bhuva<i>h</i>! svar (earth, air,</p>

 <p>heaven)!' for the horse is sacred to Pra<i>g</i>âpati: with its own deity he thus supplies it. With, 'Parched grain, or parched groats?--in grain-food and in food from the cow'--he takes down the remaining food <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">1</font></a> (from the cart) for the horse: he thereby makes the (king's) people eaters of food (prosperous);--'eat ye, gods, this food! eat thou, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, this food!' he thereby supplies the people with food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:9">13:2:6:9</a></font></span>9. Verily, fiery spirit and spiritual lustre pass away from him who performs the A<i>s</i>vamedha. The Hot<i>ri</i> and the Brahman engage in a Brahmodya <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">2</font></a> (theological discussion); for the Hot<i>ri</i> relates to Agni, and the Brahman (priest) to B<i>ri</i>haspati, B<i>ri</i>haspati being the Brahman (n.): fiery spirit <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">3</font></a> and spiritual lustre he thus bestows together on him. With the (central) sacrificial stake between them, they discourse together; for the stake is the Sacrificer <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">4</font></a>: he thus encompasses the Sacrificer on both sides with fiery spirit and spiritual lustre.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:12">13:2:6:12</a></font></span>12. 'What is the remedy for cold?'--the remedy for cold, doubtless, is Agni '(fire): fiery spirit they thus bestow on him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:6:13">13:2:6:13</a></font></span>13. 'And what is the great vessel?'--the great vessel, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world: on this earth he thus establishes himself.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_792"></a><a href="sbe44088.htm#fr_796">311:2</a> Along with the sacrificial horse three other horses are put to the chariot, with the formula Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 6. Previously to this, however, the Hot<i>ri</i> recites eleven verses in praise of the horse (cf. <a href="sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:16">XIII, 5, 1, 16</a>). Both the horses and the chariot are decorated <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a> with gold ornaments. The Adhvaryu then drives with the Sacrificer to a pond of water to the east of the sacrificial ground (an indispensable feature in choosing the place of sacrifice), and having driven into the water he makes him pronounce the formula XXIII, 7, 'When the wind hath entered the waters, the dear form of Indra, do thou, singer of praise, make that horse come back to us by that path;' whereupon they return to the sacrificial ground.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_800"></a><a href="sbe44088.htm#fr_804">314:5</a> The actual replies to the questions in Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 9 and 11, are contained in the corresponding verses ten and twelve; being given here in an expository way, with certain variations and <a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 315</font></a> occasional explanatory words (such as 'v<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i,' rain, in <a href="sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:14">paragraph 14</a>). The answers to the first four questions are supposed to be given by the Hot<i>ri</i>, and the last four by the Brahman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_801"></a><a href="sbe44088.htm#fr_805">315:1</a> This is the meaning assigned here to 'vayas' by Mahîdhara; but the other meaning of 'vayas,' viz. 'youthful vigour, or age, (generally),' would seem to suit much better, or at least to be implied. And Harisvâmin accordingly takes it in the sense of 'vârdhakam' (old age, or long life). Mahîdhara, moreover, identifies the horse with the horse-sacrifice, which, in the shape of a bird, carries the Sacrificer up to heaven. On this notion cp. part iv, introduction, pp. xxi-xxii.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_802"></a><a href="sbe44088.htm#fr_806">315:2</a> Instead of '<i>s</i>rî<i>h</i>,' the answer given to this question in Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 12 was 'avi<i>h</i>' which would either mean 'the gentle, kindly one,' or 'the sheep (f.),' but which Mahîdhara (in the former sense) <a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 316</font></a> takes as (an epithet of) the earth which he also takes '<i>s</i>rî' to mean in the above passage of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a; whilst to the ἅπαξ λεγόμενον 'pilippilâ' he assigns the meaning 'slippery' (<i>k</i>ikka<i>n</i>a) as applying to the earth after rain (? deriving it from the root 'lip,' to smear, anoint). Harisvâmin, on the other hand, takes 'pilippilâ' to be an onomatopoetic word, in the sense of '(glossy), beautiful, shining':--rûpânukarana<i>s</i>abdo<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>ya<i>m</i> bahurûpâvilâ (? bahurûpânvitâ) uddyotavatî; and he adds:--<i>s</i>rîmî<i>m</i>tratu<i>h</i> (? <i>s</i>rîr mantre tu) avi<i>h</i> pippaloktau (?) sâ tu <i>s</i>rîr eveti brâhma<i>n</i>e viv<i>ri</i>ta<i>m</i>, katham, iya<i>m</i> vâ avi<i>h</i> p<i>ri</i>thivî, sâ <i>k</i>a <i>s</i>rî<i>h</i>, <i>s</i>rîr vâ iyam iti va<i>k</i>anât.
