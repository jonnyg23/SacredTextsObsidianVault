Now there is one animal sacrifice of the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a order <a name="fr_369"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and another of the order of the Soma-sacrifice. Of the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a order is that at which he (the Adhvaryu) brings him fast-food <a name="fr_370"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">4</font></a>, leads water</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:7:2:2">11:7:2:2</a></font></span>2. Concerning this they ask, 'Is the animal sacrifice an ish<i>t</i>i or a great (Soma-) sacrifice?'--'A great sacrifice,' let him say; 'for in that (other) case <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_374"><font size="1">4</font></a> thou hast made the animal sacrifice an ish<i>t</i>i, and shattered it.' Thus he should say to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:7:2:3">11:7:2:3</a></font></span>3. Its fore-offerings are the morning-service <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">5</font></a>, its after-offerings the evening-service, and its sacrificial cake <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">6</font></a> the midday-service.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:7:2:4">11:7:2:4</a></font></span>4. Now, some bring up the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs (presents to the priests) when the omentum has been offered <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">7</font></a>;</p>

 <p>but let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (Sacrificer) has brought the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs outside of the vital airs (or, of life), he has not strengthened his vital airs: he will become either blind, or lame, or deaf, or paralyzed on one side;' then that would indeed he likely to come to pass.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:7:2:5">11:7:2:5</a></font></span>5. Let him perform it in this way:--when the I<i>d</i>â of the cake-offering has been invoked, he should bring up the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs; for to Indra belongs this vital air in the centre (of the body): by means of the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs he thus strengthens this vital air in the centre (of the body); and to Indra also belongs the midday Soma-service, and at the midday-service the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs are brought up: therefore. he should bring up the Dakshi<i>n</i>âs after the invocation of the I<i>d</i>â of the cake-offering.</p>

Here now they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou initiate him?' Well, let them <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">1</font></a> sustain him till the purificatory bath,--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, the Hot<i>ri</i>, the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a, the Brahman, and the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Âgnîdhra, for it is through these that this (formula) is called 'sha<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ot<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">1</font></a>': having rapidly muttered that 'sha<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ot<i>ri</i>,' he offers, performing either one or five oblations of ghee <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_380"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--'The heaven is his <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_381"><font size="1">3</font></a> back, the air his body, O Vâ<i>k</i>aspati, by his limbs he gave rise to the sacrifice, by his forms to the earth; by his flawless voice and his flawless tongue to the god-gladdening invocation, Hail!' This, indeed, is his initiation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:7:2:7">11:7:2:7</a></font></span>7. As to this they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou take him down to the purificatory bath?' Well, when they perform with the heart-spit <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">4</font></a>, that is his purificatory bath.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:7:2:8">11:7:2:8</a></font></span>8. Madhuka Paiṅgya once said, 'Some perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others do so with Soma. Now, Soma was in the heavens, and Gâyatrî, having become a bird, fetched him; and inasmuch as one of his leaves (par<i>n</i>a) was cut off <a name="fr_383"></a><a href="#fn_383"><font size="1">5</font></a>,</p>

 <p>that was how the Par<i>n</i>a-tree arose:' such, indeed, is (the passage in) the Brâhma<i>n</i>a that is told. And some, it is true, perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others with Soma; for he who makes the sacrificial stake other than of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood, performs the animal sacrifice without Soma; and he who makes the sacrificial stake of Palâ<i>s</i>a performs the animal sacrifice with Soma: therefore let him make his sacrificial stake of Palâ<i>s</i>a wood.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_369"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_369">119:3</a> That is, the offering of the Agnîshomîya he-goat which takes place on the day before the press-day (see part ii, p. 162 seqq.); whilst the Savanîya-pa<i>s</i>ubandha is performed on the day of the Soma-sacrifice itself; the victim being slaughtered during the morning-service, and the flesh-portions cooked during the day and offered at the evening-service (cf. part ii, p. 313, note 3; p. 356, note 3).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_370"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_370">119:4</a> That is, milk from the Vratadughâ cow (which may be mixed with some rice or barley; III, 2, 2, 14), the only food to be taken by the Sacrificer during his dîkshâ, or period of initiation--in this case on the day before the Soma-sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_371"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_371">120:1</a> That is, the so-called 'pra<i>n</i>îtâ<i>h</i>' used for sacrificial purposes generally, and especially for supplying what is required for pressing the Soma. Cf. the comm. on Kâty. VI, 7, 19, where the 'pra<i>n</i>îtâpra<i>n</i>ayana' is expressly referred to as a necessary element of the performance of the Agnîshomîya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_372"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_372">120:2</a> For the pouring out of the water on the south side of the Vedi, at the end of the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, see I, 9, 3, 1 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_373"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_373">120:3</a> The Sacrificer intercepts with his hands some of the water poured out, touches his face therewith, and then strides the three Vish<i>n</i>u-strides; cf. I, 9, 3, 8 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_374"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_374">120:4</a> Viz. in case of the animal sacrifice being performed on the Havirya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a or Ish<i>t</i>i model; which, strictly speaking, would involve the use of no other offering-material except milk, ghee, and dishes made of cereals.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_375"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_375">120:5</a> The usual order of subject and predicate would require the translation, 'the morning-service is its fore-offerings,' which would hardly be in accordance with the author's reasoning.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_376"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_376">120:6</a> For the pa<i>s</i>u-puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a, III, 8, 3, 1 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_377"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_377">120:7</a> That is, prior to the offering of the 'animal cake' (pa<i>s</i>u-puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a), whilst the presentation of the dakshi<i>n</i>âs--a head of cattle, or a milch-cow, or some other desirable object--according to Kâty. VI, 7, 29, should take place after the offering of the I<i>d</i>â, which marks the end of the Pa<i>s</i>u-puro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a-ish<i>t</i>i.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_378"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_378">121:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a supplies '<i>g</i>anâ<i>h</i>,' 'the people;' but possibly the text of the commentary may be corrupt in this place. The author's meaning would seem to be that, as there is no purificatory bath at the end of the animal sacrifice performed on the Soma-day, the Sacrificer's strength is to be kept up by the Sha<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ot<i>ri</i> formula (representing the six priests themselves) which will carry him as far as the purificatory bath at the end of the Soma-sacrifice. I am, however, far from sure that this is the real meaning of the passage. The Sha<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ot<i>ri</i> is performed (at the animal sacrifice of the pressing-day) shortly after the beginning of the ceremonies connected with the Pa<i>s</i>ubandha, viz. immediately after the 'yûpâhuti,' see part ii, p. 162 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_379"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_379">122:1</a> That is, one containing (mentioning), or requiring, six offering-priests, the number required for the animal sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_380"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_380">122:2</a> In either case the offering consists of five ladlings of ghee; and in the case of a single oblation, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, a different dipping-spoon (sruva) would seem to be used for each ladling; unless, indeed, 'ekaikena sruvena' mean 'with one sruva-full each.' According to Kâty. VI, 1, 36, the formula is merely 'run through mentally.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_381"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_381">122:3</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a interprets 'thy back'; and he apparently supplies 'prâpnoti' at the end of the first half-verse, whilst 'airayat' he takes to stand for the second person singular.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_382"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_382">122:4</a> That is, when the heart is roasted on the spit prior to its being offered; see III, 8, 3, 16. This use of the spit is to take the place of the purificatory bath, the technical term of which is 'spit-bath' (<i>s</i>ûlâvabh<i>ri</i>tha), the spit being on that occasion buried at the point where the dry and the moist meet,' see III, 8, 5, 8-10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_383"></a><a href="sbe44038.htm#fr_383">122:5</a> Either a leaf of Soma or a feather of Gâyatrî was cut off by an <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a> arrow shot by an archer pursuing Gâyatrî, and, on its falling to the earth, a Palâ<i>s</i>a, or Par<i>n</i>a, tree (Butea frondosa) sprang forth, see III, 3, 4, 10.</p>
