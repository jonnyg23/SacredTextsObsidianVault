Now the gods, when going upwards, did not know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse knew it: when they go upwards with the horse, it is in order to know (the way to) the heavenly world. 'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">1</font></a> is what they spread out for the horse <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">2</font></a>:</p>

 <p>thereon they quiet (slay) it, as (is done) for no other victim; and thus they separate it from the other victims.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:8:2">13:2:8:2</a></font></span>2. When they quiet a victim they kill it. Whilst it is being quieted, he (the Adhvaryu) offers (three) oblations <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 18), 'To the breath hail! to the off-breathing hail! to the through-breathing hail!' he thereby lays the vital airs into it, and thus offering is made by him with this victim as a living one <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:8:3">13:2:8:3</a></font></span>3. With, 'Ambâ! Ambikâ! Ambâlikâ <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">3</font></a>! there is no one to lead me,'--he leads up the (four)</p>

 <p>wives <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thereby has called upon them (to come), and, indeed, also renders them sacrificially pure.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:8:4">13:2:8:4</a></font></span>4. With (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 19), 'We call upon thee, the host-leader of (divine) hosts, O my true lord!' the wives walk round (the horse), and thus make amends to it for that (slaughtering <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">2</font></a>): even thereby they (already) make amends to it; but,</p>

 <p>indeed, they also fan <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">1</font></a> it. Thrice they walk round <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for three (in number) are these worlds: by means of these worlds they fan it. Thrice again they walk round <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">3</font></a>,--that amounts to six, for there are six seasons: by means of the seasons they fan it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:2:8:5">13:2:8:5</a></font></span>5. But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who perform the fanning at the sacrifice. Nine times they walk round <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for there are nine vital airs: vital airs they thus put into their own selves, and the vital airs do not depart from them. 'I will urge the seed-layer, urge thou the seed-layer!' (the Mahishî says <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">5</font></a>);--seed, doubtless, means offspring and cattle: offspring and cattle she thus secures for herself. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 20,] 'Let us stretch our feet,' thus in order to secure union. 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves' (the Adhvaryu says),--for that is, indeed, heaven where they immolate the victim: therefore he</p>

 <p><a name="fn_815"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_819">320:1</a> The 'iti' seems superfluous; Harisvâmin explains it by 'etat trayam.' For a similar use of the particle, see <a href="sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:1">XIII, 2, 2, 1</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_816"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_820">320:2</a> That is, they spread them on the ground for the horse to lie upon. Differently St. Petersb. Dict., 'they spread over the horse;' but see Kâty. XX, 6, 10 comm.; and Harisvâmin:--vâso yad antardhânâyâlam, adhivâso yad â<i>k</i><i>kh</i>âdanâyâlam, ta<i>k</i> <i>k</i>a vâsasa upari stara<i>n</i>îya<i>m</i>, tayor upari hira<i>n</i>ya<i>m</i> nidheyam, tasmi<i>m</i>s traye enam adhi upari sa<i>m</i><i>g</i><i>ñ</i>apayanti;--and he then remarks that these three objects here do not take the place of the stalk of grass which, in the ordinary animal sacrifice, is thrown on the place where the victim is to be killed and cut up (III, 8, 1, 14; Kâty. VI, 5, 15-16), but that the stalk is likewise put down on this occasion. Similarly the comm. on Kâtyâyana, where it is stated that the stalk of grass (or straw) is first laid down, and then the others thereon. Indeed, as was the case in regard to the stalk of grass--representing the barhis, or layer of sacrificial grass on the vedi--so here the fourfold underlayer is intended to prevent any part of the sacrificial material (havis)--the victim in this case--from being spilt. The <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a> upper garment (or cloth) must be sufficiently large to allow its being afterwards turned up so as to cover the horse and the queen consort.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_817"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_821">321:1</a> Prior to these, however, he offers the two 'Paripa<i>s</i>avya,' i.e. 'oblations relating to the victim,'--or, perhaps, 'oblations performed in connection with the carrying of fire round the victim,' for this last ceremony is performed for all the victims (whereupon the wild beasts placed between the stakes are let loose) before the killing of the horse. See III, 8, 1, 6-16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_818"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_822">321:2</a> For the symbolic import of this, see III, 8, 2, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_819"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_823">321:3</a> These are just three variants used in addressing a mother (Mutter, Mütterchen, Mütterlein), or, indeed, as here, any woman (good lady! good woman!. Acc. to Kâty. XX, 6, 12, this is the formula which the assistant priest (the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, or, according to others, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>, cf. Kâty. VI, 5, 27-28) makes the king's wives say whilst leading them up to the slain horse to cleanse it. It is, moreover, to be preceded by the formula used, at this juncture, at the ordinary animal sacrifice, viz. 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched one, advance unresisted unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth! Ye divine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! may ye be well-prepared preparers!' (III, 8, 2, 2-3). The words 'Ambâ!' &amp;c. are, according to Mahîdhara, addressed by the women to one another. The latter part of the formula as given in the Vâ<i>g</i> . Sa<i>m</i>h. (viz. 'the horse sleeps near Subhadrikâ, dwelling in Kâmpîla') is apparently <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> rejected (? as antiquated, or inauspicious) by the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a. The ceremony of lying near the dead horse being looked upon as assuring fertility to a woman, the formula used here is also doubtless meant to express an eagerness on the part of the women to be led to the slaughtered horse, representing the lord of creatures, Pra<i>g</i>âpati. On this passage compare the remarks of Professor Weber (Ind. Stud. I, p. 183), who takes the formula to be spoken by the queen consort to her three fellow-wives; and who also translates the words 'na mâ nayati ka<i>s</i> <i>k</i>ana' (nobody leads me) by 'nobody shall lead me (by force to the horse; but if I do not go) the (wicked) horse will lie near (another woman such as) the (wicked) Subadhrâ living in Kâmpîla.'--Harisvâmin's commentary on this passage is rather corrupt, but he seems at all events to assume that each of the four wives apostrophizes the others with the above formula (probably substituting their real names for the words 'ambâ,' &amp;c.):--lepsam (? lipsâ<i>m</i>) tâvad esha patnîvaktraka<i>h</i> (? patnîvakirata<i>h</i>) prâpnoti, katham, ekaikâ hi patnî itarâs tisra âmantrya <i>s</i>eshâ<i>h</i> paridevayamânâ d<i>ri</i><i>s</i>yate, he ambe he ambike he ambâlike yûyam apu<i>n</i>yâ nîshpâdotv asya (?) samîpa<i>m</i>, sa <i>k</i>a pakshapâtî kutsito<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>svako mayi yushmâka<i>m</i> sasasti meva (!) subhadrikâ<i>m</i> kâmpîlavâsinîm ida (? iha) surûpâ<i>m</i> na tu mâ<i>m</i> ka<i>s</i><i>k</i>it tatra nayatîti; sasastîty eva vartamânasâmîpye vartamânavad (Pâ<i>n</i>. III, 3, 131) ity âsannasevane drash<i>t</i>avya<i>h</i>.--This barbarous ceremony was evidently an old indigenous custom too firmly established in popular practice to be easily excluded from the sacrificial ritual. That it had nothing to do with Vedic religion and was distasteful to the author of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a is evident from the brief way in which he refers to it, and from the far-fetched symbolic explanations attached to the formulas and discourses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_820"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_824">322:1</a> Viz. from their ordinary place near the Gârhapatya he leads them whilst holding jars of water in their hands.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_821"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_825">322:2</a> Apahnuvate vismaranty evâsmai etat pradakshi<i>n</i>âvartanena sa<i>m</i><i>g</i><i>ñ</i>apanam unnayanti, comm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_822"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_826">323:1</a> Thus Harisvâmin:--dhuvate dhûnane(na) upavâ<i>g</i>ayanti, evam a<i>s</i>va<i>m</i> râ<i>g</i>ânam iva vya<i>g</i>anair etat,--'they shake themselves,' St. Petersb. Dict.; and, indeed, it is doubtless by the flutter of the garments produced in walking round first one way and then another, that the fanning is supposed to be produced.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_823"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_827">323:2</a> Viz. in sunwise fashion (pradakshi<i>n</i>â), that is so as to keep the object circumambulated on one's right side.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_824"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_828">323:3</a> Viz. in the opposite, the 'apradakshi<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>' way, as is done in the sacrifice to the departed ancestors. They do so with the text, 'We call upon thee, the dear Lord of the dear ones, O my true lord!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_825"></a><a href="sbe44090.htm#fr_829">323:4</a> Viz. another three times in the sunwise way. Having completed their circumambulation, the king's wives cleanse the horse's apertures of the vital airs (mouth, nostrils, eyes, &amp;c.), as the Sacrificer's wife did at the ordinary animal sacrifice (III, 8, 2, 4), which they do with the text, 'We call upon thee, the treasure-lord of treasures, O my true lord!'</p>
