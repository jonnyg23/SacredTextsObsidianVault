 <p>these,--to wit, the sacrifice, Man, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati,--do not exceed one another?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:2">12:3:1:2</a></font></span>2. Seeing that the upward Stomas follow the sacrifice, fitting themselves by repetitions with Sâmans, how do they enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:3">12:3:1:3</a></font></span>3. The Prâya<i>n</i>îya Atirâtra, the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day, the four Abhiplavas, and the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya (sha<i>d</i>aha):how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:4">12:3:1:4</a></font></span>4. Fitted out with the Abhi<i>g</i>it, the Svarasâmans join the Vishuvat on both sides:--how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:5">12:3:1:5</a></font></span>5. Setting out with the Triv<i>ri</i>t, fitted out with the (Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a and) Saptada<i>s</i>a, and ending with the Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a; with (the series of stomas increasing) successively by four (syllables <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_486"><font size="1">1</font></a>):--how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:6">12:3:1:6</a></font></span>6. The Triv<i>ri</i>t is his head, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a his neck; and the chest, they say, corresponds to the Saptada<i>s</i>a; the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a they make the belly, and</p>

 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>  
 <p>the two sides, by means of the Tri<i>n</i>ava, correspond to the ribs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:7">12:3:1:7</a></font></span>7. The Abhiplavas on both sides (of the Vishuvat) are his arms, the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya is the back,--so say the wise; and his spine the Brâhma<i>n</i>as fashion in the year by means of the (series of stomas increasing) successively by four (syllables).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:8">12:3:1:8</a></font></span>8. The Abhi<i>g</i>it and Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it are his ears; and his eyes, they say, correspond to the Svarasâmans; the Vishuvat, they say, is the breath of the nostrils; and the Go and Âyus are those two downward breathings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:3:1:9">12:3:1:9</a></font></span>9. The Da<i>s</i>arâtra they call his limbs, and the Mahâvrata the Brâhma<i>n</i>as fashion (arrange) so as to be the mouth in the year <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_487"><font size="1">1</font></a>;--the Supreme Self has entered into that year endowed with all stomas and with all sâmans: having fashioned him alike with the body, the sage is seated free from pain <a name="fr_488"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">2</font></a> on the heights of the ruddy one (the sun).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_486"></a><a href="sbe44053.htm#fr_486">166:1</a> The Triv<i>ri</i>t, or nine-versed stoma, is, however, followed by the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a, or fifteen-versed stoma--the thirteen-versed form not being in ordinary use--and these are succeeded by the Saptada<i>s</i>a (17), Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (21), &amp;c. Possibly, however, this last sentence may refer to the six days of the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya-sha<i>d</i>aha for which the stomas consisting of 9, 25, 17, 21, 27 and 33 verses respectively are used. On the Abhi<i>g</i>it day, each of the first four stomas is used in succession for three stotras, the four hymn-forms thus making up the twelve stotras of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma. On the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it day, on the other hand, only three stomas are used--the Triv<i>ri</i>t, Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a, and Saptada<i>s</i>a--four stotras being assigned to each of these three hymn-forms.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_487"></a><a href="sbe44053.htm#fr_487">167:1</a> Though the Mahâvrata day is actually the last day but one of the one year's sacrificial session, whilst the <i>K</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day is the second, these two days mark really the end and beginning of the year, whilst the nominal first and last days of the sessional performance may be considered as consisting of mere preliminary and concluding (winding-up) rites. The above symbolic identification of the Mahâvrata with the mouth of Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the Year, might thus lead one to suppose (as, indeed, is done by Prof. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 11) that if two such annual sessions were immediately to succeed each other, the Mahâvrata and Katurvim<i>s</i>a would fall on one and the same day. The Mahâvrata, representing (at least symbolically) the winter-solstice, would thus mark both the end and the beginning of two successive solar periods.</p>
