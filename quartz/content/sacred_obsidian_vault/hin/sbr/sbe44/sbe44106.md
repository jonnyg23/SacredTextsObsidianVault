 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:2">13:5:1:2</a></font></span>2. Now, some make its Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman a Sâman of four (verses), saying, 'It is neither an Agnish<i>t</i>oma, nor an Ukthya <a name="fr_982"></a><a href="#fn_977"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' If they do so, let hire (the Hot<i>ri</i>),</p>

 <p>after reciting the Stotriya <a name="fr_983"></a><a href="#fn_978"><font size="1">1</font></a> (strophe) together, recite the Anurûpa (strophe) together: the Rathantara P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-sâman <a name="fr_984"></a><a href="#fn_979"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the <i>S</i>astra containing the Rathantara (text), and the Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice--thereby he makes sure of this world.</p>

'There are twenty-one Savanîya <a name="fr_985"></a><a href="#fn_980"><font size="1">3</font></a> victims, all of them sacred to Agni: for these there is one and the same performance,' so say some; but, indeed, he should immolate two sets of eleven (victims), with the view of his obtainment of whatever desired object there may be in (victims) belonging to a set of eleven.</p>

(he offers)--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything: thus it is for his obtaining and securing everything.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:5">13:5:1:5</a></font></span>5. The central day is an ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day <a name="fr_987"></a><a href="#fn_982"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for the twenty-one-fold is yonder sun, and he is the A<i>s</i>vamedha: by means of his own Stoma he thus establishes him in his own deity,--therefore it is an ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:6">13:5:1:6</a></font></span>6. And, again, as to why it is an ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day;--man is twenty-one-fold--ten fingers, ten toes, and the body (self) as the twenty-first: by means of that twenty-one-fold self he thus establishes him in the twenty-one-fold (day) as on a firm foundation,--therefore it is an ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:7">13:5:1:7</a></font></span>7. And, again, as to why it is an ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day;--the ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, assuredly, is the foundation of Stomas, and manifold is that ever-varying performance which takes place on this day,--and it is because he thinks that that manifold and ever-varying performance which takes place on this day, shall take place so as to be established on the ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a as a firm foundation, that this is an ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:8">13:5:1:8</a></font></span>8. Now, as to the morning-service of this day. The Hot<i>ri</i>, having recited as the Â<i>g</i>ya (hymn <a name="fr_988"></a><a href="#fn_983"><font size="1">2</font></a>) in the Paṅkti (metre) 'Agni I think on, who is good . . .,' recites thereto the one of a one-day's</p>

And the Bârhata Praüga and the Mâdhu<i>kh</i>andasa one he recites both together <a name="fr_990"></a><a href="#fn_985"><font size="1">2</font></a> in triplets--(this being done) for the obtainment of the objects of desire which (may be contained) both in the Bârhata and the Mâdhu<i>kh</i>andasa Praüga.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:9">13:5:1:9</a></font></span>9. Then as to the midday-service. For the obtainment of the A<i>s</i>vamedha, the ati<i>kh</i>andas (verse, II, 22, 1), 'In the three troughs the buffalo drank the barley-draught,' is the opening verse of the Marutvatîya (<i>s</i>astra); for outstanding, indeed, is this ati<i>kh</i>andas (hypercatalectic verse) amongst metres, and outstanding is the A<i>s</i>vamedha amongst sacrifices. This (verse), being recited thrice, amounts to a triplet, and thereby he obtains the object of desire which (may be contained) in the triplet. 'Here, O good one, is the pressed plant' (<i>Ri</i>g-veda VIII, 2, 1-3) is the 'anu<i>k</i>ara' (sequent triplet): this same (triplet) is the constant</p>

 <p>connecting link of the one-day's sacrifice <a name="fr_991"></a><a href="#fn_986"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Having recited both the paṅkti (verses, I, 80, 1-16) 'Here in the Soma-draught alone (the Brahman gave thee strength),' and the six-footed ones (VIII, 36, 1-7) 'The patron thou art of the offerer of Soma,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the Marutvatîya (-<i>s</i>astra).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:10">13:5:1:10</a></font></span>10. Then as to the Nishkevalya (-<i>s</i>astra <a name="fr_992"></a><a href="#fn_987"><font size="1">2</font></a>). The Mahânâmnî (verses) are the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a (-stotra); and he recites them along with the anurûpa (verses) and pragâtha (-strophes), for the obtainment of all the objects of his desire, for in the Mahânâmnîs, as well as in the A<i>s</i>vamedha, are contained all objects of desire. Having recited the paṅkti verses (I, 81, 1-9) 'Indra hath grown in ebriety and strength,' and the six-footed ones (VIII, 37, 1-7) 'This sacred work didst thou protect in</p>

 <p>fights with V<i>ri</i>tra,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice <a name="fr_993"></a><a href="#fn_988"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The midday-service is (thus) set right.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:11">13:5:1:11</a></font></span>11. Then as to the evening-service. The atî<i>kh</i>andas verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 25), 'Unto that god Savit<i>ri</i> within the two bowls (do I sing praises <a name="fr_994"></a><a href="#fn_989"><font size="1">2</font></a>),' is the opening verse <a name="fr_995"></a><a href="#fn_990"><font size="1">3</font></a> of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva(-<i>s</i>astra <a name="fr_996"></a><a href="#fn_991"><font size="1">4</font></a>): the mystic import thereof is the same as of the former (ati<i>kh</i>andas verse). The Anu<i>k</i>ara <a name="fr_997"></a><a href="#fn_992"><font size="1">5</font></a> (<i>Ri</i>g-veda I, 24, 3-5), 'Unto (abhi) thee, (the lord of treasures), O god Savit<i>ri</i>, (ever helpful we come for our share . . .),' contains (the word) 'abhi,' as a form (sign) of victory (abhibhûti). Having recited the Sâvitra (triplet, VI, 71, 4-6), 'Up rose this god Savit<i>ri</i>, the friend of the house . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice <a name="fr_998"></a><a href="#fn_993"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Having recited the four verses to Heaven and Earth (IV, 56, 1-4), 'The mighty Heaven and Earth, the most glorious, here . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn I, 159) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the Ârbhava (hymn, IV, 34), '<i>Ri</i>bhu, Vibhvan, Indra, Vâ<i>g</i>a, come ye to this our sacrifice . . .,'</p>

 <p>he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 111) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the (hymn, V, 41) to the All-gods, 'Who is there righteous unto you, Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a? . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 89) of the one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva (-<i>s</i>astra).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:12">13:5:1:12</a></font></span>12. Then as to the Âgnimâruta <a name="fr_999"></a><a href="#fn_994"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Having recited the (hymn, VI, 7) to (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara, 'The head of the sky, and the disposer of the earth . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, III, 3) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the (hymn, V, 57) to the Maruts, 'Hither, O Rudras, come ye united with Indra . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 87) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the nine verses (VI, 15, 1-9) to <i>G</i>âtavedas, 'This guest of yours, the early-waking . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 143) of the one-day's sacrifice. And as to why the (hymns) of the one-day's sacrifice are used for inserting the Nivid, it is for the sake of his (the Sacrificer's) not being deprived of a firm foundation, for the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma is a foundation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:13">13:5:1:13</a></font></span>13. For this (day) there are those sacrificial animals--'A horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gom<i>ri</i>ga <a name="fr_1000"></a><a href="#fn_995"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' fifteen 'paryaṅgyas': the mystic import of these has been explained. Then these wild ones--for spring he seizes (three) kapi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>alas <a name="fr_1001"></a><a href="#fn_996"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for summer sparrows, for the rainy season partridges: of these</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a></p>  
 <p>(wild animals) also (the mystic import) has been told <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_997"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:14">13:5:1:14</a></font></span>14. Then those (victims) for the twenty-one (stakes). He seizes twenty-one animals for each of the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_998"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for as many as there are gods of the Seasonal offerings so many are all the gods; and all objects of desire are in the A<i>s</i>vamedha: 'by gratifying all the deities I shall gain all my desires,' so he thinks. But let him not proceed in this way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:15">13:5:1:15</a></font></span>15. Let him seize seventeen victims for the central stake <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_999"><font size="1">3</font></a>, in order that he may gain and secure every-thing,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 384</font></a></p>  
 <p>for the seventeenfold is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the seventeenfold (stoma) is everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything;--and sixteen at each of the other (stakes) in order that he may gain and secure everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything. Thirteen wild (beasts) he seizes for each intermediate space, in order that he may gain and secure everything, for the year consists of thirteen months, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:16">13:5:1:16</a></font></span>16. Now, prior to the (chanting of the) Bahishpavamâna, they (the assistants of the Adhvaryu) bring up the horse, after cleansing it; and with it they glide along for the Pavamâna: the mystic import of this has been explained <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_1000"><font size="1">1</font></a>. When the Bahishpavamâna has been chanted, they make the horse step on the place of chanting: if it sniffs, or turns away, let him know that his sacrifice is successful. Having led up that (horse), the Adhvaryu says, 'Hot<i>ri</i>, sing praises!' and the Hot<i>ri</i> sings its praises <a name="fr_1006"></a><a href="#fn_1001"><font size="1">2</font></a> with eleven (verses, <i>Ri</i>g-veda I, 163, 1-11)--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:17">13:5:1:17</a></font></span>17. 'When, first born, thou didst neigh . . .'--thrice (he praises) with the first, and thrice with the last (verse), these amount to fifteen,--fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with that thunderbolt, vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the very first repels evil: thus <a name="fr_1007"></a><a href="#fn_1002"><font size="1">3</font></a>, indeed, it is to the Sacrificer that the thunderbolt is given in</p>

 <p><a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 385</font></a></p>  
 <p>order to smite for him whoever is to be smitten.--[<i>Ri</i>g-veda I, 163, 12. 13], The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying. . . .'--'The racer hath gone forward to the highest place. . .'--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:5:1:18">13:5:1:18</a></font></span>18. Having omitted these two (verses), he inserts the hymn (I, 162), 'Never (shall forget us) Mitra, Varu<i>n</i>a, Aryaman, Âyu . . .,' in the Adhrigu <a name="fr_1008"></a><a href="#fn_1003"><font size="1">1</font></a> (litany). Some, however, insert this verse (I, 162, 18), 'Thirty-four (ribs) of the steed, akin to the gods, (doth the knife hit) . . .,' before the (passage,--'twenty-six are its) ribs,' thinking lest they should place the holy syllable 'om' in the wrong place <a name="fr_1009"></a><a href="#fn_1004"><font size="1">2</font></a>, or lest they should suggest the plural by a singular <a name="fr_1010"></a><a href="#fn_1005"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Let him not proceed thus, but let him insert the hymn as a whole.--'The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying . . .'--<font size="-1" color="green">'</font>The racer hath gone forward to the highest place . . .'--</p>

 <p><a name="fn_977"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_982">376:1</a> According to the practice here referred to, the Agnish<i>t</i>omasâman would not consist merely of the one triplet (usually Sâmav. II, 53-4 i.e. the so-called ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya triplet) ordinarily used for it, but of four different Sâmans, inasmuch as three of the triplets which may be used for the Uktha-stotras (of the Ukthya and other sacrifices) are added to that ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya triplet. In that case, however, the latter is not chanted to its own 'ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya' tune, but the Vâravantîya tune is used for all the four triplets. This practice is somewhat vaguely referred to in Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya-Br. XIX, 5, 10-11. 'One Sâman (tune), many metres (texts): therefore one (man) feeds many creatures. Verily, the Agnish<i>t</i>oma (sâman) is the self, and the metres (hymn-texts) are cattle: he thus secures cattle for his own self. It is neither an Ukthya nor an Agnish<i>t</i>oma (sacrifice), for cattle are neither (entirely) domestic nor wild (viz. because though kept "in the village," they also freely graze "in the forest").' Here the passage 'One Sâman, many metres,' according to the commentary, refers to the Vâravantîya tune as being employed, on this occasion, for the texts of the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya, the Sâkama<i>s</i>va (II, 55-57, here the Calc. ed., by mistake, calls the second tune figured for chanting, like the first, Sâkama<i>s</i>va, instead of Vâravantîya), the Saubhara (II, 230-2, where the Calc. ed., by mistake, omits the name Vâravantîya), and the Taira<i>s</i><i>k</i>a (II, 233-5; curiously enough, the Taira<i>s</i><i>k</i>a is not mentioned, in Lâ<i>t</i>y. Sr. VIII, 9-10, amongst the Sâmans that may be used for the third--or the A<i>k</i><i>kh</i>âvâka's--Uktha, but Sâya<i>n</i>a, on Sâmav. II, 233, states distinctly, 'taira<i>s</i><i>k</i>a<i>m</i> t<i>ri</i>tîyam uktham'). Whilst, as Uktha-stotras, the last three texts would usually he chanted in the ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, or twenty-one-versed form, in the present instance, as part of the <i>k</i>atush<i>t</i>oma, they would be chanted (along with the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya) in the twenty-four-versed form. Thus, though an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice, inasmuch as it has twelve stotras, yet it is not a regular one; neither is it an Ukthya, because the Ukthas are not chanted as so many Stotras, followed by the recitation of separate Sastras. In the Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. X, 6, different alternatives are proposed for the chanting of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma-sâman <a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 377</font></a> in the 'Gotamastoma (i.e. <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma) antarukthya' and the corresponding Sastra, including apparently the employment of the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya-sâman either for all the four triplets, or for the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya triplet alone with the respective Sâmans used for the other triplets; different modes of recitation being thereby implied with regard to the Stotriya and Anurûpa pragâthas.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_985"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_990">379:2</a> The Bârhata Praüga, or Praüga-<i>s</i>astra in the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre,--being the one recited on the fifth day of the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya-sha<i>d</i>aha (Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. VII, 12, 7), and consisting of the seven different triplets, addressed to as many different deities,--is to be recited also on this occasion; and along with it (or rather, intertwined with it, triplet by triplet) the ordinary Praüga-<i>s</i>astra of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, made up of the two hymns Rig-veda I, 2 and 3 which are ascribed to Madhu<i>kh</i>andas, and consist of nine and twelve verses, or together seven triplets. I do not understand why Harisvâmin mentions 'Vâyur agregâ<i>h</i>' (? Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXVII, 31) as being the first triplet of the Mâdhu<i>kh</i>andasa Praüga, instead of I, 2, 1-3 'vâyav â yâhi dar<i>s</i>ata.' The Praüga is the Hot<i>ri</i>'s second <i>S</i>astra of the morning-service, being preceded by the chanting of the first Â<i>g</i>ya-stotra; see part ii, p. 325.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_986"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_991">380:1</a> See part ii, p. 337, where the same triplet forms the anu<i>k</i>ara of this Sastra at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma. It is followed there by the Pragâthas VIII, 53, 5-6; I, 40, 5-6 (read thus! each two counting as one triplet); three Dhâyyâ verses, and the Marutvatîya Pragâthas VIII, 89, 3-4 (!), These are to be followed up, on the present occasion, by the two hymns I, 80, and VIII, 36, after which the Indra hymn X, 73, the chief part of the normal Marutvatîya Sastra, is to be recited, with the Nivid formula inserted after the sixth verse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_987"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_992">380:2</a> That is, the <i>S</i>astra succeeding the chanting of the first, or Hot<i>ri</i>'s, P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotra (see part ii, p. 339). Whilst, however, in the one-day's sacrifice, the Rathantara (or the B<i>ri</i>hat) sâman is used for that stotra, the Mahânâmni verses (see part iii, introd. p. xx, note 2), with the Sâkvara tune, are to be used as the Stotriyâs on this occasion, and are therefore likewise to be recited by the Hot<i>ri</i> as Stotriya-pragâthas (cf. Â<i>s</i>v. VII, 12, 10 seqq.), to be followed up by the antistrophe (anurûpa)--here consisting of the triplets I, 84, 10-12; VIII, 93, 31-3; I, 11, 1-3--and the Sâma-pragâtha, VIII, 3, 1-2.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_996"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1001">382:3</a> The 'Kapi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ala' is a kind of wildfowl, apparently of the quail or partridge species--a hazel-cock, or francoline partridge. Some of the later authorities, however, identify it with the '<i>k</i>âtaka' <a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a> ('cuculus melanoleucus'). With regard to some of the wild animals referred to in the corresponding section of the Vâ<i>g</i>. S., the commentator Mahîdhara significantly remarks (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIV, 29; cf. Kâty. XX, 6, 6 scholl.) that the meaning of such names as are not understood must be made out with the help of quotations (nigama), Vedic vocabularies (nigha<i>n</i><i>t</i>u) and their comments (nirukta), grammar (vyâkara<i>n</i>a), the Unâdiv<i>ri</i>tti, and dictionaries.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_997"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1002">383:1</a> Viz. XIII, 2, 4, 1 seqq. It is not easy to see why the text should break off abruptly with the birds representing the rainy season. For autumn there are to be (three) quails, for winter 'kakara,' and for the dewy season 'vikakara.' Then follow, to the end of the 260 wild animals, a long series of divinities to each of which (or sometimes to allied deities) three animals are consigned. Thirteen of these wild animals are placed on each of the twenty spaces between the twenty-one stakes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_998"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1003">383:2</a> Or, perhaps, for the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings he seizes twenty-one animals for each (stake); which would certainly simplify the distribution of those animals. Regarding the victims actually consecrated to the deities of the <i>K</i>âturmâsya offerings, see <a href="sbe44087.htm#page_309">p. 309</a>, note <a href="sbe44087.htm#fn_787">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_999"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1004">383:3</a> This does not include the twelve 'paryaṅgyas' tied to the horse's limbs, but only the horse and two other victims sacred to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and twelve of a long series of beasts, of which three are dedicated to each successive deity (or allied group of deities). To these are afterwards added Agni's two victims belonging to the two sets of eleven victims (of the other twenty of which one is assigned to each of the other stakes).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1000"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1005">384:1</a> <a href="sbe44085.htm#13:2:3:1">XIII, 2, 3, 1</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1001"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1006">384:2</a> The mode of recitation is similar to that of the kindling-verses (likewise eleven, brought up, by <i>r</i>epetitions of the first and last, to fifteen), viz. by making a pause after each half-verse, but without adding the syllable 'om' thereto. Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. X, 8, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1002"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1007">384:3</a> Harisvâmin explains 'tad vai' as standing for 'sa vai' (liṅgavyatyayena)--viz. that fifteenfold thunderbolt.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1003"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1008">385:1</a> On this recitation, consisting of a lengthy set of formulas, addressed to the slaughterers, see part ii, p, 188, note 2. The whole of the formulas are given Ait. Br. II, 6-7. The hymn, according to Â<i>s</i>v. X, 8, 7; is to be inserted either before the last formula of the litany, or somewhat further back--viz. before the formula 'sha<i>d</i>vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>atir asya vaṅkrayas,' 'twenty-six are its ribs'--whilst our Brâhma<i>n</i>a rather allows the alternative of the eighteenth verse of I, 162 being inserted at the latter place,--unless, indeed, the insertion in that case is to be made immediately before the word 'vaṅkraya<i>h</i>' which is scarcely likely.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1004"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1009">385:2</a> Harisvâmin seems to take this to mean that as this verse is of the same nature as the formulas of the Adhrigu litany, he is to treat it as such, as otherwise, in reciting he would have to pronounce 'om' after that verse, which is not done after those formulas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1005"></a><a href="sbe44106.htm#fr_1010">385:3</a> Or, the plurality by the individual. Owing to the corrupt state of the MS., the commentator's explanation of this passage is not clear. He seems, however, at any rate, to take the 'plural' to refer to the formula 'sha<i>d</i>vi<i>m</i><i>s</i>atir asya vaṅkrayas,' where apparently 'eshâm' has to be substituted for 'asya' on this occasion, as many victims are immolated, and the ribs of a plurality of beasts are thus indicated, whilst in verse eighteen of the hymn, on the <a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 386</font></a> contrary, only the ribs of one horse (thus forming a kind of unit) are referred to; and if that verse were recited, along with the whole hymn, before the final formula which refers to all the victims, the necessary connection would be interrupted.</p>
