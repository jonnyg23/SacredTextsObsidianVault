He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the A<i>s</i>vamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the A<i>s</i>vamedha; and he indeed becomes great and more numerous.</p>

He offers them on both sides (before and after) the omentum;--the A<i>s</i>vamedha, doubtless, is the Sacrificer, and that Mahiman (cup) is the king: it is with royal dignity he thus encompasses him on both sides.

 <p><a name="fn_834"></a><a href="sbe44093.htm#fr_838">327:2</a> The formula uttered whilst the first Mahiman cup is offered runs thus (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 2): 'What greatness of thine there hath <a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a> been in the day and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the wind and the air; what greatness of thine there hath been in the heavens and the sun, to that greatness of thine, to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, hail, to the gods!' whilst that of the second Mahiman cup runs thus (XXIII, 4): 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the earth and the fire; what greatness of thine there hath been in the Nakshatras (lunar asterisms) and the moon, to that greatness of thine, to Pra<i>g</i>âpati, to the gods, hail!' cf. <a href="sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:23">XIII, 5, 2, 23</a>; <a href="sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:7">3, 7</a>.</p>
