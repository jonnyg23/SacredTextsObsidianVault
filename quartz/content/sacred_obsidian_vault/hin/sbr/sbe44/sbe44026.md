 <p>right arm of his; the oblation to Agni thereof this thumb; that to Soma this (fore-finger); and that to Savit<i>ri</i> this (middle finger).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:2">11:5:2:2</a></font></span>2. That cake (to Savit<i>ri</i>), doubtless, is the largest, and hence this (middle finger) is the largest of these (fingers). That (oblation) to Sarasvatî is this (third) finger; and that to Pûshan this (little finger). And that (oblation) to the Maruts is this joint above the hand (the wrist); and that to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i> is this (elbow <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">1</font></a>); and that to Heaven and Earth is this arm: this (oblation) is indistinct <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whence that limb also is indistinct <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_253"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

The Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsa <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">4</font></a> offerings are this right leg,--the five oblations which this has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five toes; and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation) belongs to two deities</p>

 <p>whence there are these two knuckles. That (oblation) to Varu<i>n</i>a is this (shank); that to the Maruts this (thigh); and that (cake) to Ka is this back-bone: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence that (back-bone) is indistinct.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:4">11:5:2:4</a></font></span>4. The offering to (Agni) Anîkavat (of the Sâkamedhâ<i>h</i> <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_255"><font size="1">1</font></a>), doubtless, is his (Pra<i>g</i>âpati's) mouth, for the mouth is the extreme end (anîka) of the vital airs; the Sâ<i>m</i>tapanîyâ (pap) is the chest, for by the chest one is, as it were, confined <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">2</font></a> (sa<i>m</i>-tap); the G<i>ri</i>hamedhîyâ (pap) is the belly--to serve as a foundation, for the belly is a foundation; the Krai<i>d</i>ina oblation is the male organ, for it is therewith that (man) sports (krî<i>d</i>), as it were; and the offering to Aditi <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">3</font></a> is this downward breathing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:5">11:5:2:5</a></font></span>5. The Great Oblation, indeed, is this left leg,--the five oblations which it has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five toes; and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation) belongs to two deities whence there are</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p>these two knuckles. The (oblation) to Mahendra is this (shank); that to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman this (thigh): this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this (thigh) also is indistinct.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:6">11:5:2:6</a></font></span>6. The <i>S</i>unâsîrîya <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">1</font></a>, doubtless, is this left arm,--the five oblations which it has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five fingers; the <i>S</i>unâsîrîya is that joint of his above the hand; that (oblation) to Vâyu is this (elbow); that to Sûrya this arm: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this (limb) also is indistinct.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:7">11:5:2:7</a></font></span>7. Now these Seasonal offerings are tripartite and furnished with two joints <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">2</font></a>, whence these limbs of man are tripartite and furnished with two joints. Two of these four (sacrifices) have each three indistinct (low-voiced) oblations; and two of them have two each <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:8">11:5:2:8</a></font></span>8. At all four of them they churn out the fire,</p>

 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>whence (the draught animal) pulls with all four limbs. At two of them they lead (the fire) forward <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whence it (the animal) walks on two (feet at a time) <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Thus, then, Pra<i>g</i>âpati fashioned for himself a body by means of the Seasonal sacrifices; and in like manner does the Sacrificer who knows this fashion for himself a (divine) body by means of the Seasonal sacrifices.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:9">11:5:2:9</a></font></span>9. As to this they say, 'The Vai<i>s</i>vadeva oblation (should have) all (its formulas) in the Gâyatrî, the Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsâ<i>h</i> all in the Trish<i>t</i>ubh, the Great Oblation all in the <i>G</i>agatî, and the <i>S</i>unâsîrîya all in the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre, so as to yield a Katush<i>t</i>oma <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_263"><font size="1">3</font></a>.' But let him not do this, for inasmuch as (his formulas) amount to these (metres) even thereby that wish is obtained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:2:10">11:5:2:10</a></font></span>10. Now, indeed, (the formulas of) these Seasonal offerings. amount to three hundred and sixty-two B<i>ri</i>hatî verses <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">4</font></a>: he thereby obtains both the year <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p>and the Mahâvrata <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and thus, indeed, this Sacrificer also has a twofold <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">2</font></a> foundation, and he thus makes the Sacrificer reach the heavenly world, and establishes him therein.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_250">74:2</a> The Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, or first of the four seasonal sacrifices, requires the following oblations:--1. a cake on eight potsherds to Agni; 2. a pap to Soma; 3. a cake on twelve or eight potsherds to <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a> Savit<i>ri</i>; 4. a pap to Sarasvatî; 5. a pap to Pûshan--these first five oblations recur at all seasonal offerings;--6. a cake on seven potsherds to the Maruts; 7. a dish of clotted curds to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>; 8. a cake on one potsherd to Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_251"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_251">75:1</a> It would rather seem that what is intended here by 'sa<i>m</i>dhi' is not the joints themselves, but the limbs (in the anatomical sense) between the articulations. Similarly in 'trishandhi' in <a href="sbe44026.htm#11:5:2:7">parag. 7</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_252"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_252">75:2</a> That is to say, it is a low-voiced offering, the two formulas, with the exception of the final Om and Vausha<i>t</i>, being pronounced in a low voice. All cakes on one potsherd are (except those to Varu<i>n</i>a) of this description; Kâty. <i>S</i>r. IV, 5, 3; Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. II, 15, 5; cf. <i>S</i>at. Br. II, 4, 3, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_253"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_253">75:3</a> That is, not clearly defined; the word 'dos,' which is more usually restricted to the fore-arm, being also used for the whole arm, and even the upper arm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_254"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_254">75:4</a> The Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsâ<i>h</i>, or second seasonal sacrifice, has the following oblations:--1-5. the common oblations; 6. a cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni; 7. 8. two dishes of clotted curds for Varu<i>n</i>a and the Maruts respectively; 9. a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Pra<i>g</i>âpati).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_255"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_255">76:1</a> The Sâkamedhâ<i>h</i>, or third seasonal sacrifice, consists of the following oblations:--1. a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Anîkavat; 2. 3. paps to the Maruta<i>h</i> Sâ<i>m</i>tapanâ<i>h</i> and Maruta<i>h</i> G<i>ri</i>hamedhina<i>h</i>; 4. a cake on seven potsherds to the Maruta<i>h</i> Krî<i>d</i>ina<i>h</i>; 5. a pap to Aditi. Then follows the Great Oblation consisting of 6-10, the five common oblations; 11. a cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni; 12. a pap to Mahendra; and 13. a cake on one potsherd to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman. Then follows the Pit<i>ri</i>ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_256"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_256">76:2</a> Or, according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, one gets oppressed or heated on account of the close proximity of the heart and the digestive fire,--urasâ h<i>ri</i>daya-sambandhâ<i>g</i> <i>g</i>a<i>th</i>arasannive<i>s</i>â<i>k</i> <i>k</i>a sa<i>m</i>tâpana-vishayatvam.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_257"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_257">76:3</a> This offering of a cake to Aditi, mentioned in Kâty. Sr. V, 7, 2, is not referred to in the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's account of the Sâkamedhâ<i>h</i>, see II, 5, 3, 20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_258"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_258">77:1</a> The Sunâsîrîya, or last Seasonal offering, consists of--1-5. the common oblations; 6. the <i>S</i>unâsîrîya cake on twelve potsherds; 7. a milk oblation to Vâyu; 8. a cake on one potsherd to Sûrya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_259"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_259">77:2</a> The Seasonal offerings are performed so as to leave an interval of four months between them; the fourth falling exactly a year after the first; hence the whole performance consists, as it were, of three periods of four months each, with two joints between them;--corresponding to the formation of the arms and legs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_260"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_260">77:3</a> Of the five oblations common to the four sacrifices, one--viz. the cake to Savit<i>ri</i>--is a low-voiced offering (Kâty. Sr. IV, 5, 5; Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. II, 15, 7), as are also the one-kapâla cakes of which there is one in each sacrifice. According to Sâya<i>n</i>a the first and last Seasonal sacrifices have only these two Upâm<i>s</i>uyâ<i>g</i>as, whilst the second and third have each one additional low-voiced oblation, but he does not specify them. This is, however, a mistake, as Kâtyâyana, <i>S</i>r. IV, 5, 6. 7, states distinctly, that the two additional low-voiced oblations are the Vai<i>s</i>vadevî payasyâ in the first, and the oblation to Vâyu in the last, <i>K</i>âturmâsya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_261"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_261">78:1</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a this refers to the first and last Seasonal sacrifices, inasmuch as there is no uttaravedi required for these, and hence only the simple leading forward of the fire to the Âhavanîya hearth; whilst the commentary on Katy. V, 4, 6, on the contrary, refers it just to the other two, because a double leading forth takes place there.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_262"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_262">78:2</a> Or, as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it, man walks on two feet.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_263"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_263">78:3</a> The <i>K</i>atush<i>t</i>oma, properly speaking, is the technical term for such an arrangement of the Stotras of a Soma-sacrifice by which they are chanted on stomas, or hymn-forms, increasing successively by four verses. Two such arrangements (of four and six different stomas respectively) are mentioned, one for an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice, and the other for a Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in. See note on <a href="sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:4">XIII, 3, 1, 4</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_264"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_264">78:4</a> These 362 B<i>ri</i>hatî verses (of 36 syllables each) would amount to 13,032 syllables; and, verses of the four metres referred to amounting together to 148 syllables, this amount is contained in the former 88 times, leaving only eight over; so slight a discrepancy being considered of no account in such calculations.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_265"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_265">78:5</a> That is, a year of 360 days; and if, as is done by Sâya<i>n</i>a (in <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a> accordance with the calculations in Book X), the year is identified with the fire-altar, a mahâvedi containing 360 Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_266"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_266">79:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a reminds us that the Mahâvrata-sâman consists of five parts in five different stomas (Triv<i>ri</i>t, &amp;c., see part iv, p. 282, note 4), the verses of which, added up (9, 15, 17, 25, 21), make 87, which amount is apparently, in a rough way, to be taken as identical with that of 88 obtained in note <a href="#fn_264">4</a> of last page.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_267"></a><a href="sbe44026.htm#fr_267">79:2</a> Viz. inasmuch as the total amount of B<i>ri</i>hatîs (362) exceeds by two the number of days in the year.</p>
