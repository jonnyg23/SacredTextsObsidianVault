 <p>the others,' said <i>S</i>ailâli; 'for, doubtless, Ka is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and behind Pra<i>g</i>âpati are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'</p>

'Let them proceed (with the omenta) singly and not otherwise,' said Indrota Saunaka; 'why, indeed, should they hasten? It is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.' This, then, is what these have said, but the established practice is different therefrom.</p>

The Puroru<i>k</i> thereof is (Vâ<i>g</i>. XXIII, 3), 'He who by his greatness hath become the one king of the breathing and blinking world, [and who here ruleth over the two-footed and the four-footed: to the god Ka (Who?) will we pay homage by offering].' The Anuvâkyâ and Yâ<i>g</i>yâ are interchanged so as to (ensure) unimpaired vigour <a name="fr_1028"></a><a href="#fn_1023"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the Praisha (direction to Hot<i>ri</i>) is the same (as that of the first cup). As the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered, he offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

But concerning this, Sâtyaya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>i said, 'They may indeed do it in either way, only one must not depart from the (right) path.' But the former, indeed, is the established practice. The sacrifice (of the second day) is an Ukthya: thereby he causes the air-world to prosper. The last day is an Atirâtra with all the Stomas, for him to obtain and secure everything, for the Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1019"></a><a href="sbe44108.htm#fr_1024">392:1</a> Whilst there are amongst the victims immolated on the second day, several others consecrated to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>, Indra and Agni, and Ka,--the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, Aindrâgna, and Kâya victims, referred to in this and the following two paragraphs, belong to the Kâturmâsya, or Seasonal victims, being amongst those tied to the fourteenth and sixteenth stakes. Though the text speaks only of one Vai<i>s</i>vadeva &amp;c. victim, there are really three such victims in each case. According to the views referred to in these paragraphs (cf. comm. on Kâty. XX, 7, 23), the omenta of all the preceding victims (from the 'paryaṅgya' onwards) up to the beginning of the Kâturmâsyas, would be offered together after (or along with) the vapâs of those of the respective victims (Vai<i>s</i>vadeva &amp;c.) specified in these paragraphs; and along therewith the vapâs of all the subsequent Seasonal victims. The deities to which this heap of omenta would be offered, would thus be either the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>, or Indra and Agni, or Ka, as representing all the deities. Â<i>s</i>v. S. X, 9, 7, assigns the omenta of all the victims, except the three Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya ones, to the Vi<i>s</i>ve Devâ<i>h</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1021"></a><a href="sbe44108.htm#fr_1026">393:2</a> According to this view, the omenta of all the victims after the three first (Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya) ones,--i.e. beginning from the 'paryaṅgya' animals (see <a href="sbe44084.htm#page_299">p. 299</a>, note <a href="sbe44084.htm#fn_755">2</a>) up to the end of the <i>K</i>âturmâsya, or Seasonal victims, which are the last of the domesticated animals--would be put together in one heap and divided into twenty-one portions, which would then be offered to the first twenty-one deities of the Seasonal offerings, that is to say, to those of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsa, Sâkamedha, and Mahâhavis offerings, thus omitting the deities of the Pitryesh<i>t</i>i and the <i>S</i>unâsîriya offerings.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1022"></a><a href="sbe44108.htm#fr_1027">393:3</a> That is the first three victims, viz. the horse, the hornless he-goat, and the Gom<i>ri</i>ga.</p>

XX, 8, 1-3, this would seem to refer to the other Prâ<i>g</i>âpatya victims, in which case one would, however, expect the dual here, as there are only two of them besides the horse.</p>
