[The Udgât<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">1</font></a> says concerning the king's favourite wife, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 26,] 'Raise her upwards <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">2</font></a>,'--the A<i>s</i>vamedha, doubtless, is that glory, royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus raises for him (the Sacrificer) upward.</p>

'Even as one taking a burden up a mountain,'--glory (pomp), doubtless, is the burden of royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus fastens on him (as a burden); but he also endows him with that glory, royal power.</p>

 <p>thus makes the people to be food for the royal power, whence the wielder of royal power feeds on the people;--'it thinks not of the fat cattle,'--whence the king does not rear cattle;--'when the <i>S</i>ûdra woman is the Arya's mistress, he seeks not riches that he may thrive <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">1</font></a>,'--hence he does not anoint the son of a Vai<i>s</i>ya woman.</p>

IV, 39, 6,] 'The praises of Dadhikrâvan have I sung, (the victorious, powerful horse: may he make fragrant our mouths, and prolong our lives!),'--thus they finally utter a verse containing the word 'fragrant': it is (their own) speech they purify <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and the vital airs do not pass from them.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_827"></a><a href="sbe44091.htm#fr_831">324:1</a> The colloquy between the men and women, referred to in <a href="sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:1">paragraphs 1</a>-<a href="sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:8">8</a>, would seem to go on simultaneously. The verse addressed by the Hot<i>ri</i> to the king's discarded wife, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXIII, 28, is omitted by the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, as are also the verses spoken in reply by the women (with their attendants), and closely resembling those of the men in tone and wording. According to some authorities it is the attendant women alone who reply, not the king's wives. Katy. XX, 6, 20.</p>
