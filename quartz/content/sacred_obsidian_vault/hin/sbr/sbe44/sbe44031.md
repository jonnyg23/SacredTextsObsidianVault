The study and teaching (of the Veda) are a source of pleasure to him, he becomes ready-minded <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and independent of others, and day by day he acquires wealth. He sleeps peacefully; he is the best physician for himself; and (peculiar) to him are restraint of the senses, delight in the one thing <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">6</font></a>, growth of intelligence, fame, and the (task of) perfecting the people <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">7</font></a>.

 <p>intelligence gives rise to four duties attaching to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a--Brâhma<i>n</i>ical descent, a befitting deportment, fame, and the perfecting of the people; and the people that are being perfected guard the Brâhma<i>n</i>a by four duties--by (showing him) respect, and liberality, (and by granting him) security against oppression, and security against capital punishment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:2">11:5:7:2</a></font></span>2. And, truly, whatever may be the toils here between heaven and earth, the study (of the scriptures) is their last stage, their goal (limit) for him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:3">11:5:7:3</a></font></span>3. And, verily, whatever portion of the sacred poetry (<i>kh</i>andas) he studies for his lesson with that sacrificial rite <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">1</font></a>, offering is made by him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:4">11:5:7:4</a></font></span>4. And, verily, if he studies his lesson, even though lying on a soft couch, anointed, adorned and completely satisfied, he is burned (with holy fire <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">2</font></a>) up to the tips of his nails, whosoever, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:5">11:5:7:5</a></font></span>5. The <i>Ri</i>k-texts, truly, are honey, the Sâman-texts ghee, and the Ya<i>g</i>us-texts ambrosia; and, indeed, when he studies the dialogue that (speech and reply) is a mess of milk and a mess of meat.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:6">11:5:7:6</a></font></span>6. And, indeed, he who, knowing this, studies day by day the <i>Ri</i>k-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey, and, thus satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:7">11:5:7:7</a></font></span>7. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Sâman-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with ghee; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:8">11:5:7:8</a></font></span>8. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Ya<i>g</i>us-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with ambrosia; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:9">11:5:7:9</a></font></span>9. And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, for his lesson, satisfies the gods by messes of milk and meat; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:5:7:10">11:5:7:10</a></font></span>10. Moving, indeed, are the waters, moving is the sun, moving the moon, and moving the stars; and, verily, as if these deities did not move and act, even so will the Brâhma<i>n</i>a be on that day on which he does not study his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied. And hence let him at least pronounce either a <i>Ri</i>k-verse or a Ya<i>g</i>us-formula, or a Sâman-verse, or a Gâthâ, or a Kumbyâ <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">1</font></a>, to ensure continuity of the Vrata <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_324"></a><a href="sbe44031.htm#fr_324">99:6</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to take 'ekârâmatâ' in the sense of 'remaining always the same,'--eka eva sann â samantâd bhavatîty ekârâmas tasya bhâva<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_325"></a><a href="sbe44031.htm#fr_325">99:7</a> Or, perfecting the world,--tadyukto yo lokas tasya pakti<i>h</i> paripâko bhavati, Sây.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_326"></a><a href="sbe44031.htm#fr_326">100:1</a> The study of the Veda being 'the sacrifice of the Brahman,' the reading of a portion is, as it were, a special rite, or form of offering, belonging to that sacrifice. Sâya<i>n</i>a, on the other hand, takes it to mean that the student performs, as it were, the particular rite, or offering, to which the portion he reads may refer. It may, indeed, be implied, though it certainly is not expressed in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_327"></a><a href="sbe44031.htm#fr_327">100:2</a> Thus A. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 122;--<i>s</i>arîrapî<i>d</i>anena tapastapto bhavati, Sây.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_328"></a><a href="sbe44031.htm#fr_328">101:1</a> A 'Kumbyâ,' according to Sâya<i>n</i>a, is a Brâhma<i>n</i>a-passage explanatory of some sacrificial precept or rite (vidhyarthavâdâtmaka<i>m</i> brâhma<i>n</i>a-vâkyam); whilst, on Aitareyâr. II, 3, 6, 8, the same commentator explains it as a verse (<i>ri</i>g-vi<i>s</i>esha) conveying some precept of conduct (â<i>k</i>âra<i>s</i>ikshârûpa), such as 'brahma<i>k</i>âryasyâpo<i>s</i>âna<i>m</i> karma kuru, divâ mâ svâpsî<i>h</i>,' &amp;c. Cf. Prof. F. Max Müller's transl., Upanishads I, p. 230, note 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_329"></a><a href="sbe44031.htm#fr_329">101:2</a> This is in keeping with the mystic representation of this and <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a> the preceding chapters which represent the daily study of the scriptural lesson as a sacrifice continued day by day. The student, as the sacrificer, has accordingly, during the sacrifice (that is, during the period of his study of the Vedas, or for life), as it were, to limit his daily food to the drinking of the Vrata-milk, which rule he obeys symbolically by reciting such a verse or formula.</p>
