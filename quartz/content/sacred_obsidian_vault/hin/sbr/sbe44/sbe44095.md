The <i>S</i>akvarî <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">2</font></a> (verses) are the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a (-stotra of the second day): there is a different metre for each (verse), for different kinds of animals, both domestic and wild ones, are immolated here on each (day). As to the <i>S</i>akvarî (verses) being the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a, it is for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice) <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and different kinds of animals are immolated on different (days), because different stomas are performed on the different (days of the A<i>s</i>vamedha).</p>

As to this they say, 'These--to wit, goats and sheep and the wild (beasts)--are not all animals <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">1</font></a>; but those--to wit, the bovine (victims)--are indeed all animals.' On the last day he immolates bovine (victims), for they--to wit, bovine (victims)--are all animals: he thus immolates all animals. They are sacred to the All-gods <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for the completeness of the horse, for the horse is sacred to the All-gods. They are many-formed (or, many-coloured), whence animals are many-formed; and they are of distinct forms (or colours), whence animals are of distinct forms.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_839"></a><a href="sbe44095.htm#fr_843">330:3</a> For this and the other names of the dice, see part iii, p. 106, note 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_840"></a><a href="sbe44095.htm#fr_844">331:1</a> Though applying in the first place to the second day of the A<i>s</i>vamedha, as an Ukthya sacrifice which is at the same time an Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a day, i.e. one the stotras of which are all chanted in the twenty-one-versed hymn-form, Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, the twenty-first or twenty-one-fold, as is clear from <a href="sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:3">XIII, 3, 3, 3</a>, here also refers to the sun, of which it is a common epithet (cf. part iii, p. 265, note 2, also <a href="sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:11">XIII, 4, 4, 11</a>). This solar name seems to be derived from the fact that the sun is also identified with the central day of the year, the Vishuvant day, which is considered the central day of a twenty-one days’ sacrificial performance--having one p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya-sha<i>d</i>aha, an Abhi<i>g</i>it (or Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>it day resp.) and three svarasâman days before and after it;--see <a href="sbe44046.htm#page_139">p. 139</a>, note <font size="-1" color="green">*</font><a href="sbe44046.htm#fn_425">1</a><font size="-1" color="green">*</font>; and A. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 6 seqq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_841"></a><a href="sbe44095.htm#fr_845">331:2</a> That is to say, the so-called Mahânâmnî verses (Sâm. V. ed. Bibl. Ind. II, p. 371), chanted on the <i>s</i>âkvara-sâman (see part iii, of this transl., introd. p. xx, note 2), are to be used for the Hot<i>ri</i>'s P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotra. For this purpose the Rathantara-sâman is ordinarily used in the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, and the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman in the Ukthya, form of sacrifice.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_842"></a><a href="sbe44095.htm#fr_846">331:3</a> The commentator takes this as an allusion to the 'potent' (<i>s</i>akvara = <i>s</i>akta) nature of the verses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_843"></a><a href="sbe44095.htm#fr_847">332:1</a> That is to say, they do not fitly represent all kinds of animals, as the highest kind of animals, the bovine cattle, may be said to do. The argument as to the 'sarve pa<i>s</i>ava<i>h</i>' is, of course, suggested by the 'a<i>s</i>vasya sarvatvâya' of the preceding paragraph; and to bring out the parallelism, one might translate,--these . . . . are not complete animals.</p>
