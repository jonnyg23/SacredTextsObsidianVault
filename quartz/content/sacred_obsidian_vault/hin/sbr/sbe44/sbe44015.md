And, verily, even on this occasion <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">1</font></a>, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (A<i>s</i>vamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods: of this (New and Full-moon sacrifice) they say, 'It is the original (normal) A<i>s</i>vamedha;' and that (real A<i>s</i>vamedha), indeed, is just the other (modified one); for, indeed, the A<i>s</i>vamedha is the same as the moon.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:5:2">11:2:5:2</a></font></span>2. As to this, they say, 'For each foot of the sacrificial horse they offer an oblation;'--when he performs the Agnihotra in the evening and morning, he offers two oblations in the evening, and two in the morning--that makes four oblations: thus--the horse being four-footed--an oblation is offered for each of its feet.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:5:3">11:2:5:3</a></font></span>3. As to this, they say, 'On the starting off of the horse he performs an offering <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for the moon, doubtless, is the same as King Soma, the food of the gods: when, during that night (of new moon), he does not appear either in the east or in the west, then he comes to this world, and starts for this world <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">2</font></a>.<font size="-1" color="green">'</font></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:5:4">11:2:5:4</a></font></span>4. Now, when he performs the New-moon sacrifice, he thereby performs the (same) offering (as) on the starting of that (horse), and when he performs the Full-moon sacrifice he slaughters the sacrificial horse itself, and, having slaughtered it, he presents it to the gods. The other (real) horse-sacrifice they indeed perform (only) a year after (the starting offering), but this month (of the Full and New-moon sacrifice), revolving, makes up a year <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">3</font></a>: thus the sacrificial horse comes to be slaughtered for him year after year.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11:2:5:5">11:2:5:5</a></font></span>5. Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the A<i>s</i>vamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the A<i>s</i>vamedha.</p>
