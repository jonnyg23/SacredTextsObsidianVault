 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:1">12:7:2:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, his fiery spirit, his energy, or vital power, depart from him whom Soma purges either upwards or downwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:2">12:7:2:2</a></font></span>2. As to this they say, 'Truly, the Soma-juice is the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's food; and, indeed, it is not owing to Soma when a Brâhma<i>n</i>a vomits Soma; and he who vomits Soma is one who, whilst being fit to (gain) prosperity, does not gain prosperity, and who, whilst being fit to (gain) cattle, does not gain cattle <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for Soma is cattle.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:3">12:7:2:3</a></font></span>3. Let him seize for sacrifice that grey (he-goat) of the A<i>s</i>vins, the ram of Sarasvatî, and the bull of Indra; for the A<i>s</i>vins are the physicians of the gods, and it is by them that he heals this (Sacrificer); and Sarasvatî is healing medicine, and it is with her help that he prepares medicine for him; and Indra is energy (indriya), or vital power, and it is with his help that he bestows energy, or vital power, on this (Sacrificer).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:4">12:7:2:4</a></font></span>4. The two A<i>s</i>vins, indeed, are the eyesight,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>fiery spirit; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to the A<i>s</i>vins, he (the priest) bestows eyesight, fiery spirit, on this (Sacrificer). And the ear also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the eye and the ear.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:5">12:7:2:5</a></font></span>5. Sarasvatî is the breath, vital power; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to Sarasvatî, he bestows breath, vital power, on this (Sacrificer). And the off-breathing also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the breath (of the mouth) and the of breathing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:6">12:7:2:6</a></font></span>6. Indra is speech, strength; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to Indra, he bestows speech, strength, on this (Sacrificer); and mind also, for one and the same are speech and mind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:7">12:7:2:7</a></font></span>7. 'He-goats are sacred to the A<i>s</i>vins, ewes to Sarasvatî, and cows (and bulls) to Indra,' they say: if these animals are sacrificed, he, by means of those deities, gains those (three) animals.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:8">12:7:2:8</a></font></span>8. There is a mare with a foal <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">1</font></a>: the one-hoofed (animal),glory, he thereby secures (for the Sacrificer <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">2</font></a>). There are hairs of wild beasts <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for the purpose of securing the wild beasts;--there are hairs of wolf: vigour, the impetuous rush of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs of tiger: courage, the sway of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs</p>

 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p>of lion: might, the rule of wild beasts, he thereby secures.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:9">12:7:2:9</a></font></span>9. There are grains of rice and grains of millet, grains of wheat and kuvala jujubes, Indra-grain and badara jujubes, grains of barley and karkandhu jujubes, malted rice and barley <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">1</font></a>: both cultivated and wild-grain food he thereby secures; and by means of both kinds of food he duly lays energy and vital power into his own self.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:10">12:7:2:10</a></font></span>10. With lead he buys <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">2</font></a> the malted rice, with (sheep's) wool the malted barley, with thread the (fried) rice-grain,--that lead is a form of both iron and gold, and the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is both an ish<i>t</i>i-offering and an animal sacrifice, so that he thereby secures both of these.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:11">12:7:2:11</a></font></span>11. With wool and thread <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">3</font></a> he buys,--this, to wit, wool and thread, is women's work; and work, indeed, means energy, or vital power, and this latter is extinct in women: he thus secures (for the Sacrificer) that energy, or vital power, which is extinct in women.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:12">12:7:2:12</a></font></span>12. Here now, other Adhvaryus buy the malted rice with lead from a eunuch, saying, 'That is that <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for the eunuch is neither woman nor man, and the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is neither an ish<i>t</i>i-offering nor an animal sacrifice.' But let him not do so, for the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is both an ish<i>t</i>i and an animal sacrifice, and the eunuch is something unsuccessful among men: they who do this thus place failure into the very mouth (opening) of the sacrifice. Let him rather buy them from a vendor of Soma, for the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is Soma: he thus puts a form of Soma into the very mouth of the sacrifice so as to secure the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:13">12:7:2:13</a></font></span>13. There is a pot (kumbhî) perforated with a hundred holes <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for in many ways did that (Soma) flow out of (Indra); and a hundred-sized also, indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the sacrifice he thereby secures. There is a bowl (rata <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">2</font></a>): it is the real (or good) thing (sat) he thereby secures. There is a dish (<i>k</i>apya) for him to secure food. There is a filter, for they cleanse him, (the Sacrificer, by this offering). There is a tail (-whisk) for turning away evil. There is gold for him to secure form (or colour); it weighs a hundred (grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred energies: life, and energy, vital power, he thus lays into his own self.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:14">12:7:2:14</a></font></span>14. There is an a<i>s</i>vattha (ficus religiosa) vessel: honour he thereby secures. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: force he thereby secures. There is a nyagrodha (ficus indica) one: sweet drink he thereby secures. There are (earthen) pots (sthâlî): the food of the earth he thereby secures.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:15">12:7:2:15</a></font></span>15. There are supernumerary <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">3</font></a> (vessels) of palâ<i>s</i>a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>wood: the palâ<i>s</i>a (butea frondosa) is the Brahman (holy writ, holiness, the priesthood): it is by the Brahman that he gains the heavenly world. There are two feathers of a talon-slaying (bird) <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">1</font></a>: courage, the sway of birds, he thereby secures. There are thirty-six of these (objects), for the B<i>ri</i>hatî consists of thirty-six syllables, and cattle are related to the B<i>ri</i>hatî: by means of the B<i>ri</i>hatî he thus secures cattle for him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:16">12:7:2:16</a></font></span>16. As to this they say, 'The victims have one set of deities, and the cakes another set of deities: this is an improper performance <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">2</font></a>; how does it become right and proper?' To Indra belongs the last of the victims, and to Indra the first of the cakes; and Indra, indeed, is energy (indriya), or vital power: through (Indra's) energy he thus confers on him energy, or vital power; and through (Indra's) energy he secures energy, or vital power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:17">12:7:2:17</a></font></span>17. There is a cake to Savit<i>ri</i> for him to become impelled by Savit<i>ri</i>; and one to Varu<i>n</i>a, for it is Varu<i>n</i>a that seizes him who is seized by evil: through Varu<i>n</i>a he thus delivers him from Varu<i>n</i>a's power;--it is the final (cake): he thus delivers him finally from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:18">12:7:2:18</a></font></span>18. Indra's (cake) is one on eleven potsherds, in order that he may secure (Indra's) energy, or vital</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>power; for the Trish<i>t</i>ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh is energy, or vital power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:19">12:7:2:19</a></font></span>19. Savit<i>ri</i>'s (cake) is one on twelve potsherds, for there are twelve months in the year, and the year means constantly existing food: from the year he thus secures for hire food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:20">12:7:2:20</a></font></span>20. Varu<i>n</i>a's (cake) is one on ten potsherds, for the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and Varu<i>n</i>a is Virâ<i>g</i> (the widely ruling), the lord of food: through Varu<i>n</i>a he thus secures food for him. In the middle (of the sacrifice) they proceed with (the offering of) these cakes, for the centre means their (mother's) womb: he thus causes them to be produced from their own (mother's) womb.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12:7:2:21">12:7:2:21</a></font></span>21. A mare with a foal is the sacrificial fee, for such a (mare) produces both the horse and the mule, and the Sautrâma<i>n</i>î is both an ish<i>t</i>i-offering and an animal sacrifice: thus it is so in order that he may secure both of these.</p>
