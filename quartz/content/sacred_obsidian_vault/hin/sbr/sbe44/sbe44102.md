 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:1">13:4:1:1</a></font></span>1. Pra<i>g</i>âpati desired, 'Would that I obtained all my desires! would that I attained all attainments!' He beheld this three days’ Soma-sacrifice, the A<i>s</i>vamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with it: by sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all attainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the A<i>s</i>vamedha sacrifice obtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:2">13:4:1:2</a></font></span>2. Concerning this they say, 'In what season is the beginning (to be made)?'--'Let him begin it in summer,' say some, 'for summer is the Kshatriya's season, and truly this--to wit, the A<i>s</i>vamedha--is the Kshatriya's sacrifice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:3">13:4:1:3</a></font></span>3. But let him rather begin it in spring; for</p>  
 <p><a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348</font></a></p>  
 <p>spring is the Brâhma<i>n</i>a's season, and truly whosoever sacrifices, sacrifices after becoming, as it were, a Brâhma<i>n</i>a: let him therefore by all means begin it in spring.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:4">13:4:1:4</a></font></span>4. And six days, or seven days, before that full-moon of Phâlguna, the officiating priests meet together--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Hot<i>ri</i>, the Brahman, and the Udgât<i>ri</i>; for under these <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">1</font></a> the other priests are.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:5">13:4:1:5</a></font></span>5. The Adhvaryu prepares for them a priest's mess of rice sufficient for four persons: the meaning of this has been explained <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Four bowlfuls, four double handfuls, four handfuls: twelvefold this is--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything--thus it is in order to his gaining and securing everything.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:6">13:4:1:6</a></font></span>6. Those four priests eat it: the meaning of this has been explained. He (the Sacrificer) gives to them four thousand (cows) in order to his gaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything. And (he gives them) four gold plates weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:7">13:4:1:7</a></font></span>7. The Adhvaryu then, hanging a gold ornament (nishka) round him, makes him mutter (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXII, 1), 'Fire thou art, light and immortality,'--for gold, indeed, is fire, light <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and</p>

 <p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a></p>  
 <p>immortality: fire (fiery mettle), light (brilliance), and immortality he thus bestows upon him;--'protector of life, protect my life!' he thereby bestows life (vital strength) upon him. With a view to commencing the sacrifice, he then says to him, 'Restrain thy speech!' for the sacrifice is speech.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:8">13:4:1:8</a></font></span>8. Four (of the king's) wives are in attendance--the consecrated queen, the favourite wife, a discarded wife, and the Pâlâgalî <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">1</font></a>, all of them adorned and wearing gold ornaments (neck-plates)--with the view of the completeness of conjugal union. With them he enters the hall of the sacrificial fires--the Sacrificer by the eastern, the wives by the southern, door.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:9">13:4:1:9</a></font></span>9. When the evening-offering <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">2</font></a> has been performed, he lies down with his favourite wife behind the Gârhapatya hearth, with his head towards the north. At the same place <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">3</font></a> the other (wives) also lie down. He lies in her lap without embracing her <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">4</font></a>, thinking, 'May I, by this self-restraint, reach successfully the end of the year!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:10">13:4:1:10</a></font></span>10. When the morning offering has been performed, the Adhvaryu performs a full-offering <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">5</font></a> with a view to his (the Sacrificer's) gaining and securing everything, for the full means everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything. At this (offering) he releases speech by (bestowing) a boon,</p>

 <p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 350</font></a></p>  
 <p>saying, 'I grant a boon to the Brahman (priest):' (this he does) with a view to his gaining and securing everything, for a boon is everything, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is everything.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:11">13:4:1:11</a></font></span>11. The gold ornament which is attached to his (neck) he then gives to the Adhvaryu: in giving it to the Adhvaryu he secures to himself immortal life, for gold means immortal life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:12">13:4:1:12</a></font></span>12. For the object of (gaining) the road, and in order not to lose the mouth (mukha) of the sacrifice, he then prepares an ish<i>t</i>i-offering <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">1</font></a> to Agni. For, indeed, all the deities have Agni for their mouth, and in the A<i>s</i>vamedha are (contained) all objects of desire: 'Having, at the outset (mukha<i>t</i>a<i>h</i>), gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:13">13:4:1:13</a></font></span>13. For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with the thunderbolt (of) vigour the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil. The two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">3</font></a>, with a view to the repelling of evil, for</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> V<i>ri</i>tra is evil. [The verses, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIII, 14, 15,] 'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky . . . <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' and 'Be thou the leader of the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest with auspicious teams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the sky, and thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering),' pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâ<i>g</i>yâ of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>head,' the other (the verb) 'to be,'--for the head, assuredly, is he that shines yonder: thus it is in order to secure him (the Sun); and as to why (the other) contains (the verb) 'to be,'--he thereby secures that which is (the real, truly existent). The Sa<i>m</i>yâ<i>g</i>yâs <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">2</font></a> are two virâ<i>g</i>-verses <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for that--to wit, the Virâ<i>g</i>--is the metre</p>

 <p>belonging to all the gods, and all objects of desire are (contained) in the A<i>s</i>vamedha: 'Having gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks. The sacrificial fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:14">13:4:1:14</a></font></span>14. He then prepares a (pap) for Pûshan, for Pûshan is the overlord of roads: he thus secures successful progress to the horse. But Pûshan is also this (earth): he thus makes this (earth) its guardian, for neither injury nor failure befals him whom this (earth) guards on the way; and this (earth) he thus makes its guardian.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13:4:1:15">13:4:1:15</a></font></span>15. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the obtainment of the A<i>s</i>vamedha, for Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is Pra<i>g</i>âpati. The two butter-portions are possessed of 'growth <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' even for the growth of the Sacrificer. [The verses, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XXXIV, 41, 42,] 'Pûshan, in thy sway we [shall never suffer harm, we (who) here are singers of thy praises],' and 'The hymn (?) lovingly composed by desire of praise hath reached</p>

 <p>the guardian of every path: (may he, Pûshan, grant unto us draughts of light (?), and fulfil our every prayer!'), pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâ<i>g</i>yâ of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) 'sway,' the other (the word) 'path'; for sway is vigour: (thus it is) in order to his gaining and securing vigour; and as to why (the other) contains (the word) 'path,' he thereby secures successful progress to the horse. The invitatory and offering formulas of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t are two anush<i>t</i>ubh verses <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="sbe44103.htm#fn_904"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for the Anush<i>t</i>ubh is speech, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is speech, and the A<i>s</i>vamedha is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: thus it is for the obtainment of the A<i>s</i>vamedha. The priests’ fee consists of a hundred garments, for that--to wit, the garment--is man's outward appearance, whence people (on seeing) Any well-clad man, ask, 'Who can this be? for he is perfect in his outward appearance: with outward appearance he thus endows him. There are a hundred of them, for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: life, and energy, vigour, he thus gains for himself.</p>

X, 6, 3, to Agni Mûrdhanvat ('forming the head,' so called from the formulas used containing the word 'head).' For a similar special offering to the same deity see <a href="sbe44061.htm#12:4:4:1">XII, 4, 4, 1</a> (cf. <a href="sbe44007.htm#11:1:5:5">XI, 1, 5, 5</a>).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_898"></a><a href="sbe44102.htm#fr_902">350:3</a> The two Â<i>g</i>yabhâgas, or butter-portions to Agni and Soma, are said to be 'V<i>ri</i>tra-slaying' (vârtraghna), or to relate to the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra, when their anuvâkyâs, or invitatory formulas, are the two verses <i>Ri</i>g-veda VI, 16, 34 (agnir v<i>ri</i>trâ<i>n</i>i gaṅghanat, 'May Agni slay the V<i>ri</i>tras'), and I, 91, 5 (tva<i>m</i> so<i>m</i>âsi satpatis tva<i>m</i> râ<i>g</i>ota v<i>ri</i>trahâ, 'Thou, O Soma, art the true lord, thou art the king and the slayer of V<i>ri</i>tra,' &amp;c.). This is the case at the Full-moon sacrifice, whilst at the New-moon sacrifice the two butter-portions <a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a> are said to be 'v<i>ri</i>dhanvant,' or 'relating to growth,' because the anuvâkyâs used on that occasion are two verses containing forms of the root v<i>ri</i>dh, 'to grow,' viz. VIII, 44, 12 (agni<i>h</i> pratnena manmanâ . . . kavir vipre<i>n</i>a vâv<i>ri</i>dhe, 'Agni has grown strong by the old hymn,--as the wise one by the priest') and I, 91, 11 (Soma gîrbhish <i>t</i>vâ vaya<i>m</i> vardhayâmo va<i>k</i>ovida<i>h</i> . . ., 'O Soma, we magnify thee (make thee grow) by our songs, skilful in speech'). In the same way the one or the other form is used in different ish<i>t</i>is. At I, 6, 2, 12, the translation, 'the two butter-portions should be offered to the V<i>ri</i>tra-slayer (Indra)' should therefore be altered to 'the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V<i>ri</i>tra' (or, 'are V<i>ri</i>tra-slaying').</p>

 <p><a name="fn_901"></a><a href="sbe44102.htm#fr_905">351:3</a> Whilst the normal performance of an ish<i>t</i>i requires two trish<i>t</i>ubh-verses (<i>Ri</i>g-veda X, 2, I; VI, 15, 14; cf. part i, p. 202, notes 2 and 3) for the invitatory and offering formulas of the oblations to Agni Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, two virâ<i>g</i>-verses are frequently prescribed, certain verses of the Virâ<i>g</i>-hymn <i>Ri</i>g-veda VII, 1, being chiefly used for this purpose; e. g. v. 3 as the anuvâkyâ, and v. 18 as the yâ<i>g</i>yâ for the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of the oblation to Aditi at the <a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a> Âdhâna (see part i, p. 307, note 3). and the Dîksha<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i; and vv. 14, 15 as yâ<i>g</i>yâ and anuvâkyâ of the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t of the Prâya<i>n</i>îyesh<i>t</i>i. It is doubtless the two former verses, commonly employed at special ish<i>t</i>is (cf. part i, p. 164, note 3), which are to be used on the present occasion.</p>
