 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:1">3:8:4:1</a></font></span>1. Now there are three elevens at the animal offering,--eleven fore-offerings, eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings: ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the out-breathing, in-breathing and through-breathing--this much constitutes man, who is the highest of animals, after whom <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">3</font></a> are all animals.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:2">3:8:4:2</a></font></span>2. Now they say,' What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:3">3:8:4:3</a></font></span>3. When he divides the hind-part into three portions,--the hind-part being (an opening of the) vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:4">3:8:4:4</a></font></span>4. And in that he cuts the hind-part into three portions,--one third for the by-offerings, one third into the <i>g</i>uhû, and one third into the upabh<i>ri</i>t,--thereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:5">3:8:4:5</a></font></span>5. He alone, however, may slay an animal who can supply it with the sacrificial essence <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">1</font></a>. And if it be lean, let him stuff into the hind-part whatever may be left of the fat of the belly: the hind-part being (an opening of) the vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through. The animal, forsooth, is breath; for only so long (does) the animal (live), as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:6">3:8:4:6</a></font></span>6. The hind-part is (part of) the animal, and fat means sacrificial essence <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">2</font></a>: thus he supplies it with the sacrificial essence. But if it be tender (juicy), then it has itself obtained the sacrificial essence.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:7">3:8:4:7</a></font></span>7. Thereupon he takes clotted ghee; for twofold indeed is this (clotted ghee),--to wit, both ghee</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>  
 <p>and sour milk <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--and a productive union means a couple: thus a productive union is thereby effected.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:8">3:8:4:8</a></font></span>8. Therewith they perform at the after-offerings. The after-offerings mean cattle, and clotted ghee means milk: hence he thereby puts milk into the cattle, and thus milk is here contained (or beneficial, Nita) in the cattle; for clotted ghee means breath, because clotted ghee is food, and breath is food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:9">3:8:4:9</a></font></span>9. Therewith he (the Adhvaryu) performs in front (on the Âhavanîya) at the after-offerings,---whereby he puts into (the victim) that vital air which is here in front;--and therewith he (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) performs behind (the altar) at the by-offerings <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--whereby he puts into it that vital air which is here behind: thus two vital airs are here contained (or beneficial) on both sides, the one above and the one below.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:10">3:8:4:10</a></font></span>10. Here now, one (Hot<i>ri</i>) pronounces the Vasha<i>t</i> for two,--for the Adhvaryu (who performs the after-offerings)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>and for him (the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i>) who performs the by-offerings. And because he offers them by (in addition to) the offering (Adhvaryu), therefore they are called by-offerings. And in performing the by-offerings, he produces (offspring) <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">1</font></a>, since he performs the by-offerings behind (the altar), and from behind offspring is produced from woman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:11">3:8:4:11</a></font></span>11. He offers the by-offerings with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VI, 21), 'Go thou to the sea, Hail!' The sea is water, and seed is water: he thereby casts seed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:12">3:8:4:12</a></font></span>12. 'Go thou to the air, Hail!' It is into (along) the air that offspring is born: into the air he produces (offspring).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:13">3:8:4:13</a></font></span>13. 'Go thou to the divine Savit<i>ri</i>, Hail!' Savit<i>ri</i> is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit<i>ri</i> he thus produces creatures.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:14">3:8:4:14</a></font></span>14. 'Go thou to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, Hail!' Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on the creatures.</p>  
 <p>15. 'Go thou to the day and the night, Hail! It is through (along) day and night that offspring is born: through day and night he causes creatures to be born.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:16">3:8:4:16</a></font></span>16. 'Go thou to the metres, Hail!' There are seven metres; and there are seven domestic and seven wild animals: both kinds he thus causes to be produced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:17">3:8:4:17</a></font></span>17. 'Go thou to heaven and earth, Hail!' For, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having created the living beings,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 214</font></a></p>  
 <p>enclosed them between heaven and earth, and so these beings are enclosed between heaven and earth. And in like manner does this (offerer), having created living beings, enclose them between heaven and earth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:8:4:18">3:8:4:18</a></font></span>18. He then makes additional by-offerings (atiupaya<i>g</i>). Were he not to make additional by-offerings, there would only be as many living beings as were created in the beginning; they would not be propagated; but by making additional by-offerings he indeed propagates them; whence creatures are again born here repeatedly <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_531"></a><a href="sbe2634.htm#fr_533">211:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a takes 'medham' as apposition to 'enam,' and explains it by 'medhârha, prav<i>ri</i>ddha,' and 'upanayet' by 'prâpnuyât' (it is, doubtless, 'zuführen').

 <p><a name="fn_534"></a><a href="sbe2634.htm#fr_536">212:2</a> When the priests and sacrificer have eaten their portions of the I<i>d</i>â, the Agnîdh fetches hot coals from the <i>S</i>âmitra (or, at the animal offering connected with the Soma-sacrifice), optionally from the Âgnîdhra, and puts them on the Hot<i>ri</i>'s hearth (<a href="sbe2623.htm#page_148">p. 148</a>, note <a href="sbe2624.htm#fn_392">4</a>),--or at the ordinary animal offering (nirû<i>dh</i>a pa<i>s</i>u), on the north hip (north-west corner) of the altar after removing the sacrificial grass. On these coals the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> performs the by-offerings (upaya<i>g</i>), while the Adhvaryu performs the after-offerings (anuyâ<i>g</i>a) on the Âhavanîya. For the by-offerings the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> cuts the respective part and the hind-quarter (<a href="sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:18">III, 8, 3, 18</a>) into eleven parts, and at each Vasha<i>t</i> throws one piece thereof with his hand into the fire. The recipients of the first eight and the last after-offerings, on the other hand, are the same as those of the nine after-offerings at the Seasonal sacrifices (part i, p. 404). The Hot<i>ri</i>'s formulas for the additional two offerings, inserted before the last, are: 9. The divine lord of the forest [10. The divine barhis of water-plants] may graciously accept (the offering) for abundant obtainment of abundant gift! Vausha<i>t</i>!' (cf. part i, p. 235; Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. III, 6, 13.)</p>
