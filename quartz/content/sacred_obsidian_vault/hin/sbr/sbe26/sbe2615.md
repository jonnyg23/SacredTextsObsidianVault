 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:1">3:4:1:1</a></font></span>1. Verily, the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Prâya<i>n</i>îya and Udayanîya are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head: therefore those two oblations, the Prâya<i>n</i>îya and Udayanîya, are on both sides of the guest-offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:2">3:4:1:2</a></font></span>2. Now as to why it is called 'guest-offering.' He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer's) guest,--to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat--for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods--so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:3">3:4:1:3</a></font></span>3. Here now they say, 'Let him first walk past (Soma) and take out (the material for offering)!' For (they argue) where people do not show respect</p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>to a worthy person (arhant) who has come to them, he becomes angry,--and in this way he (Soma) is indeed honoured.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:4">3:4:1:4</a></font></span>4. Then only one (of the oxen) is to be unyoked, and the other to be left unyoked <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and thereupon he is to take out (the material for offering): for (they argue) in that one of them is unyoked, thereby he (Soma) has arrived; and in that the other is left unyoked, thereby he is honoured.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:5">3:4:1:5</a></font></span>5. Let him, however, not do this but let him take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking (both oxen) and after making (Soma) enter (the hall); for the ways of men are in accordance with those of the gods. And accordingly, in human practice, so long as (a guest) has not unyoked, people do not bring water to him and show him no honour, for so long he has not yet arrived; but when he has unyoked, then they bring him water and show him honour, for then he has indeed arrived: let him therefore take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking and after making (Soma) enter (the hall).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:6">3:4:1:6</a></font></span>6. Let him take it out with all speed, for thus he (Soma) is honoured. The housewife holds on to it from behind <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for the sacrificer holds on to him (Soma), while he is driven around, and here his wife does so. Thus they enclose him on the two sides by a (married) couple: and, indeed, wherever a</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>worthy person comes, there all the inmates of the house bestir themselves, for thus he is honoured.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:7">3:4:1:7</a></font></span>7. Let him take out (the material) with a different formula from that wherewith (one takes out) any other oblations <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">1</font></a>, since, when he (Soma) is bought, he is bought for one special destination,--for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres. The metres act as attendants about him; even as the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, (attend upon) the king, so do the metres act as attendants about him (Soma).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:8">3:4:1:8</a></font></span>8. In no wise, then, is it befitting that he should take out any (material for offering) solely 'for the metres <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">2</font></a>;' for whenever people cook food for some worthy person <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">3</font></a>, then the attendants about him, the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, have their share (of the food) assigned to them; after (or along with their master): hence, when he takes out that (oblation to Soma), let him assign the metres a share in it along with (the deity).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:9">3:4:1:9</a></font></span>9. He takes it out, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 1), 'Thou art Agni's body,--thee (I take) for Vish<i>n</i>u!' the Gâyatrî is Agni: to Gâyatrî he thus assigns her share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:10">3:4:1:10</a></font></span>10. 'Thou art Soma's body,--thee for Vish<i>n</i>u!' Soma is the nobility, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the nobility: to Trish<i>t</i>ubh he thus assigns her share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:11">3:4:1:11</a></font></span>11. 'Thou art the guest's hospitable entertainment <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--thee for Vish<i>n</i>u!' This is his (Soma's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the metres.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:12">3:4:1:12</a></font></span>12. 'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon! thee for Vish<i>n</i>u!' thereby he assigns to Gâyatrî her share. Because Gâyatrî, in the form of a falcon, carried off Soma from the sky, therefore she is the Soma-bearing falcon: in virtue of that heroic deed he now assigns to her a second share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:13">3:4:1:13</a></font></span>13. 'Thee for Agni, the bestower of prosperity! thee for Vish<i>n</i>u!' Prosperity means cattle, and the <i>G</i>agatî (the moving, living one) means cattle: to <i>G</i>agatî he thereby assigns her share.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:14">3:4:1:14</a></font></span>14. Now as to his taking five times;--the sacrifice is of equal measure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: the latter he gains in five (divisions);--for this reason he takes five times. And as to his taking it with 'For Vish<i>n</i>u (I take) thee! for Vish<i>n</i>u thee!' it is because he who takes out (material) for the sacrifice, takes it for Vish<i>n</i>u.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:15">3:4:1:15</a></font></span>15. It is a sacrificial cake on nine potsherds;--for the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Gâyatrî consists of nine syllables <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">2</font></a>: eight (syllables) are those he recites and the sacred syllable <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">3</font></a> is the ninth; and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacrifice <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and so is that (cake) the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore it is a cake on nine potsherds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:16">3:4:1:16</a></font></span>16. The enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">2</font></a>), for the gods, once upon a time, perceived that one, the kârshmarya, to be the Rakshas-killer among trees. Now, the guest-offering being the head of the sacrifice, the enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood, in order that the evil spirits may not injure the head of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:17">3:4:1:17</a></font></span>17. The prastara-bunch <a name="fr_236"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">3</font></a> is of a<i>s</i>vavâla-grass (Saccharum Spontaneum). For, once upon a time, the sacrifice escaped from the gods. It became a horse (a<i>s</i>va) and sped away from them. The gods, rushing after it, took hold of its tail (vâla) and tore it out; and having torn it out, they threw it down in a lump, and what had been the hairs of the horse's tail then grew up as those plants (of a<i>s</i>vavâla-grass). Now the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the tail is the hind-part (of animals): hence by the prastara being of a<i>s</i>vavâla-grass he encompasses the sacrifice on both sides.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:18">3:4:1:18</a></font></span>18. There are two vidh<i>ri</i>tis <a name="fr_237"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">4</font></a> of sugar-cane, lest</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>the barhis and the prastara should become mixed up together. Having then purified the ghee <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he takes all the butter-portions in four ladlings <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for at this (sacrifice) there are no after-offerings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:19">3:4:1:19</a></font></span>19. When he has placed the sacrificial dishes (on the altar) <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">3</font></a>, he churns the fire. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice; and in churning (the fire) they produce that (sacrifice); and one who is born is born with the head first: hence he thereby makes the sacrifice to be produced with the head first. Further, Agni means all the gods, since offering is made in the fire to all gods; and the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice: hence, through all the deities, he secures success to the sacrifice from the very head (beginning). This is why he churns the fire <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:20">3:4:1:20</a></font></span>20. He takes the bottom piece of wood <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">5</font></a>, with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 2), 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni;' for it is thereon that Agni is produced: hence he says, 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni.'</p>  
 <p>21. Thereon he lays two sprouts of a ku<i>s</i>a stalk (with the tops towards the east), with, 'Ye are</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>males <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">1</font></a>;' thereby these two are as two (sons) born together here from a woman.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:22">3:4:1:22</a></font></span>22. Thereon he lays the lower churning-stick (with the top to the north), with, 'Thou art Urva<i>s</i>î!' He then touches the (ghee in the) ghee-pan with the upper churning-stick, with, 'Thou art Âyu,' he puts it down (on the lower ara<i>n</i>i) with, 'Thou art Purûravas.' For Urva<i>s</i>î was a nymph, and Purûravas was her husband; and the (child) which sprung from that union was Âyu <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">2</font></a>: in like manner does he now produce the sacrifice from that union. Thereupon he says (to the Hot<i>ri</i>), 'Recite to Agni, as he is churned <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">3</font></a>!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:23">3:4:1:23</a></font></span>23. He churns, with the texts, 'With the Gâyatrî metre I churn thee!--With the Trish<i>t</i>ubh metre I churn thee!--With the Gagatî metre I churn thee!' For it is with the metres that he churns him (Agni, the fire); the metres he recites to him when he is churned, whereby he attaches the metres to the sacrifice, even as the rays (are attached) to yonder sun.--'Recite to the born one!' he says,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p>when he (Agni) is produced <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and 'To him who is thrown <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' when he throws him (on the old Âhavanîya fire).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:24">3:4:1:24</a></font></span>24. He throws (the fire on the hearth), with the text (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. V, 3), 'For our sake be ye two (fires) friendly to one another, of one mind, unblemished! Injure not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice! be gracious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He thus bespeaks peacefulness between them, that they may not injure each other.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:25">3:4:1:25</a></font></span>25. He then takes out some clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, and pours it on the fire, with the text (Vâg. S. V, 4), 'Agni resorteth to Agni, he the son of the seers that shieldeth us from curses: graciously offer thou for us now with good offering, never withholding the oblation from the gods, Hail!' For the purpose of offering they have produced him, and by this offering he has now gratified him: that is why he thus makes offering unto him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:4:1:26">3:4:1:26</a></font></span>26. It (the guest-offering) ends with the I<i>d</i>â; no after-offerings are performed. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the head is the fore-part: he thus fits him up as the head of the sacrifice. But were he to perform the after-offerings, it would be as if, by reversing, he were to put the feet in the place of the head. Hence it ends with the I<i>d</i>â, and no after-offerings are performed.</p>

VI, 2, 1, 1), on the ground that, if one were to unyoke both oxen, he would interrupt the sacrifice; and if he were to leave them both unyoked, it would be as if a hospitable reception were given to one who has not actually arrived.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="sbe2615.htm#fr_227">86:2</a> That is, by touching the Adhvaryu while he takes out the sacrificial food. See <a href="sbe2614.htm#page_79">p. 79</a>, note <a href="sbe2614.htm#fn_210">3</a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_228"></a><a href="sbe2615.htm#fr_229">87:2</a> According to Taitt. S.

The a<i>s</i>vavâla (horsetail) grass (generally called kâ<i>s</i>a) is said to resemble horse-hair, and is used for twine, mats, thatch, &amp;c. Sir H. M. Elliot, 'Races of the N. W. Prov.' II, pp. 371, 372, describes it as growing from three to fifteen feet high, and flowering in great profusion after the rains; the base of the flowers being surrounded with a bright silvery fleece, which whitens the neighbouring fields so much as frequently to resemble a fall of snow.</p>
