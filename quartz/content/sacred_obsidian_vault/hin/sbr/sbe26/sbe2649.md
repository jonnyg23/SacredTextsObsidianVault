 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:1">4:2:5:1</a></font></span>1. Having drawn the cups of Soma, and gone out (of the cart-shed to the high altar) <a name="fr_736"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he offers the oblation of drops <a name="fr_737"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The reason why he offers the oblation of drops is this. Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt here, to them he now wishes a safe journey to the Âhavanîya, for the Âhavanîya is the resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the oblation of drops.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:2">4:2:5:2</a></font></span>2. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VII, 26; Rig-veda X, 17, 12), 'Whatever drop of thine leapeth</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>away, whatever stalk of thine,'--whatever particle (of Soma) is spilt, that is a drop, that indeed he means; and by 'whatever stalk of thine' he mentions the stalk;--'stone-pressed, from the lap of the press-bowls;' for pressed by the stone <a name="fr_738"></a><a href="#fn_735"><font size="1">1</font></a> it leaps away from the two press-bowls;--'be it from the Adhvaryu or from the strainer,'--for it leaps away either from the Adhvaryu's hands or from the strainer,--'that I offer unto thee in my mind consecrated by Vasha<i>t</i>, Hail!' whereby it becomes for him as an offering consecrated by Vasha<i>t</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:3">4:2:5:3</a></font></span>3. Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar. The two Adhvaryus <a name="fr_739"></a><a href="#fn_736"><font size="1">2</font></a> proceed first (to the chanting-place beside the pit), as the out-breathing and in-breathing of the sacrifice; then the Prastot<i>ri</i>, as the voice of the sacrifice; then the Udgât<i>ri</i>, as the self (or body), the Pra<i>g</i>âpati, of the sacrifice; then the Pratihart<i>ri</i>, either as the physician or the through-breathing <a name="fr_740"></a><a href="#fn_737"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:4">4:2:5:4</a></font></span>4. The Sacrificer holds on to those five priests from behind <a name="fr_741"></a><a href="#fn_738"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for as much as those five priests are, so much is the whole sacrifice, the sacrifice being fivefold: hence the Sacrificer thereby holds on to the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:5">4:2:5:5</a></font></span>5. He (the Adhvaryu) then throws one of the two</p>

 <p>
 </p>

 <p>stalks of grass forward towards the pit <a name="fr_742"></a><a href="#fn_739"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with, 'Thou art the ascent of the gods!' for when the gods through the sacrifice attained to the heavenly world, it was from that pit that they went upwards to the heavenly world: he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:6">4:2:5:6</a></font></span>6. He then throws down the other stalk in front of the chanters, silently, for those chanters represent the hymn of praise (stotra), Pra<i>g</i>âpati (the sacrifice),--he (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) draws to himself everything here, and takes possession of everything here: it is to him that that stalk is offered, and thus he does not draw the Adhvaryu to himself, and take possession of him. And when they mutter <a name="fr_743"></a><a href="#fn_740"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--for the chanters mutter now <a name="fr_744"></a><a href="#fn_741"><font size="1">3</font></a>,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:7">4:2:5:7</a></font></span>7. Then he bespeaks the chant, saying, 'Soma becometh pure!' He bespeaks the chant right off <a name="fr_745"></a><a href="#fn_742"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and they chant right off; for these chants, the Pavamânâ<i>h</i> <a name="fr_746"></a><a href="#fn_743"><font size="1">5</font></a>, are directed towards the gods, since</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a></p>  
 <p>the gods thereby attained to the heavenly world right off (straightway): therefore he bespeaks the chant right off, and right off they chant.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:8">4:2:5:8</a></font></span>8. With 'Turn ye back <a name="fr_747"></a><a href="#fn_744"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' (he bespeaks) the other chants (viz. the Dhuryas), and turning back (or repeating) they chant the Dhuryas <a name="fr_748"></a><a href="#fn_745"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for the latter</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:9">4:2:5:9</a></font></span>9. And as to why they chant the Bahishpavamâna here (near the <i>k</i>âtvâla). In the beginning, forsooth, yonder sun was here on earth <a name="fr_749"></a><a href="#fn_746"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The seasons embraced him and ascended from hence to the heavenly world: there he burns firmly established</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the seasons. And in like manner do the priests thereby embrace the sacrificer and ascend from hence to the heavenly world: this is why they chant the Bahishpavamâna h ere.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:10">4:2:5:10</a></font></span>10. The Bahishpavamâna <a name="fr_750"></a><a href="#fn_747"><font size="1">1</font></a> chant truly is a ship</p>

 <p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>bound heavenwards: the priests are its spars and oars, the means of reaching the heavenly world. If there be a blameworthy one, even that one (priest) would make it sink: he makes it sink, even as one who ascends a ship that is full would make it sink. And, indeed, every sacrifice is a ship bound heavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a blameworthy (priest) away from every sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:11">4:2:5:11</a></font></span>11. Thereupon, when the chanting is over <a name="fr_751"></a><a href="#fn_748"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a></p>  
 <p>utters this speech,--'Agnîdh, spread the fires! strew the barhis! Prepare the cakes! go on with the victim!' The Agnîdh spreads the fires, that is to say, kindles them <a name="fr_752"></a><a href="#fn_749"><font size="1">1</font></a>; he strews that barhis <a name="fr_753"></a><a href="#fn_750"><font size="1">2</font></a>, thinking, 'When the barhis is strewn, I will offer to the gods on the kindled (fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he says, because he is about to proceed with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the victim,' because he is about to get ready the victim <a name="fr_754"></a><a href="#fn_751"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:12">4:2:5:12</a></font></span>12. Having again entered (the cart-shed) he draws the Â<i>s</i>vina graha <a name="fr_755"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Having drawn the Â<i>s</i>vina graha he goes out and girds the sacrificial stake <a name="fr_756"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">5</font></a>; and having girt the stake he gets ready the victim: he thereby puts flavour (juice) into him (Soma--the sacrificer).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:13">4:2:5:13</a></font></span>13. Having been slain at the morning feast, it continues being cooked till the evening feast; whereby he puts flavour (juice) into the whole sacrifice, imbues it with flavour.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:14">4:2:5:14</a></font></span>14. Let him therefore, at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, slay a (victim) sacred to Agni, for there is harmony when, at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, he slays a (victim) for Agni. If</p>

 <p>it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra and Agni in the second place, for songs of praise (uktha) <a name="fr_757"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">1</font></a> refer to Indra and Agni. If it be a Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra in the third place, for the sixteenfold chant (sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in) <a name="fr_758"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">2</font></a> means Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let him slay one to Sarasvatî in the fourth place, for Sarasvatî is speech, and speech (vâ<i>k</i>, fem.) is female, as the night (râtri, fem.) is female: he thus duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice <a name="fr_759"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>

Now Soma is a god, for Soma was in the heaven;--'Soma, forsooth, was V<i>ri</i>tra; the mountains and stones are his body: thereon grows that plant called U<i>s</i>ânâ,' said <i>S</i>vetaketu Auddâlaki; that they bring hither and press.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:16">4:2:5:16</a></font></span>16. Now when he slays the victim, he thereby puts flavour into it; and when he proceeds with (the offering of) the Soma feast cakes, he puts sap into it: thus it becomes Soma for him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:17">4:2:5:17</a></font></span>17. They all belong to Indra; for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: that is why they all belong to Indra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:18">4:2:5:18</a></font></span>18. And as to why there are a cake, parched barley-grain, a porridge, sour curds, and clotted curds,--it is that those who are the deities of the sacrifice shall be well-pleased.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:19">4:2:5:19</a></font></span>19. For, when one has eaten cake here, he wishes, 'I should like to take parched grains, I should like to eat porridge, I should like to eat sour curds, I should like to eat clotted curds!' All these (are Objects of one's) wishes: it is in order that those who are the deities of the sacrifice shall be well-pleased. Now as to why that offering of clotted curds (payasyâ) is prepared only at the morning libation, and not at the two other libations (Soma feasts).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:2:5:20">4:2:5:20</a></font></span>20.

 <p><a name="fn_743"></a><a href="sbe2649.htm#fr_746">307:5</a> The first stotra at each pressing is called pavamâna (purifying, i.e. during the chanting of which the Soma becomes clarified), viz. the Bahishpavamâna at the morning, the Mâdhyandina pavamâna at the midday, and the Ârbhava (or t<i>ri</i>tîya) pavamâna at the evening pressing. The other stotras are called Dhurya, 'to be harnessed, belonging to or forming a team.' For the correspondence between the stotra and <i>s</i>astra, see <a href="sbe2650.htm#page_325">p. 325</a>, note <a href="sbe2651.htm#fn_774">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_744"></a><a href="sbe2649.htm#fr_747">308:1</a> This is Sâya<i>n</i>a's interpretation of 'upâvartadhvam,' instead of 'draw near,' as translated by me at I, 5, 2, 12. He is probably right in connecting it with the repetitions which certain verses have to undergo in the dhurya-stotras.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_745"></a><a href="sbe2649.htm#fr_748">308:2</a> There are many different stomas, or forms of chanting stotras, named from the number of verses produced in each form (generally by repetitions of certain verses). Those required for the Sha<i>d</i>aha and Dvâda<i>s</i>âha (see IV, 5, 4, 1 seq.) are: triv<i>ri</i>t (9), pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a (15), saptada<i>s</i>a 07), ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (21), tri<i>n</i>ava (27), trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (33), <i>k</i>aturvi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (24), <i>k</i>atu<i>s</i><i>k</i>atvâri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (44), and ashta<i>k</i>atvâri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a (48). The first four of these are those most frequently used, and the only ones used at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma. All these stomas, with one exception (24), have two or more different varieties or arrangements, called vish<i>t</i>uti, differing from one another either in the order in which the several verses are to be chanted, or in regard to the number of repetitions which the corresponding verses have to undergo. Besides, stomas are generally performed in three turns or rounds, paryâya, consisting of a triplet of verses (some of which may have to be repeated more than once), and preceded by the sound 'hu<i>m</i>' (Hiṅkâra). Thus the first Â<i>g</i>yastotra, Sâmav. II, 10-12, (consisting of three verses, a, b, c,) is to be performed in the pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a-stoma; that is, the three verses have to be so treated, by repetitions, as to produce fifteen verses in three turns. Now, as there are three different varieties of performing the pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a-stoma, the stotra might be chanted in one or other of the following three arrangements:--</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

 <p>The three paryâyas of a stoma (or vish<i>t</i>uti) show each three subdivisions (viz. a a a--b--c. being those of the first paryâya above), called vish<i>t</i>âva. When the Udgât<i>ri</i>s are about to commence a chant, the Prastot<i>ri</i> spreads in their midst a cloth, doubled up so that the unwoven fringe lies over the selvage, either towards the east or north. Thereon he marks the subdivisions of the rounds, by means of sticks (ku<i>s</i>â), a span long, of some kind of wood suitable for sacrifice, split lengthways along the pith (the bark being left outside) and somewhat pointed at one end, then smeared over with some fragrant substance, and wrapped up singly in pieces of the same kind of cloth as that spread on the ground. The marking of the vish<i>t</i>âvas, or subdivisions, takes place at the end of the prastâva or prelude (see next page, note <a href="#fn_747">1</a>) in this way, that each vish<i>t</i>âva is marked by as many sticks as the corresponding verse has to be repeated; those of the first vish<i>t</i>âva being laid down with the point to the north, then behind or west of them those of the second turn with the point to the west, and behind them those of the third turn with the point to the north. Thereupon those of the other two rounds are laid down in the same way, each turn north of the preceding one. Hence the arrangement of sticks for the first of the above varieties of the pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a-stoma would be three straight, one across, one straight; one straight, three across, one straight; one straight, one across, three straight.</p>  
 <p>With the exception of the Bahishpavamâna, the chanting is performed in the Sadas by the side of the Udumbara post (see <a href="sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:2">III, 6, 1, 2</a> seq.), the latter being likewise enclosed in a cloth of the above description, wrapt round it from left to right, with the unwoven fringe towards the top.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_747"></a><a href="sbe2649.htm#fr_750">310:1</a> The Bahishpavamâna-(stotra), or 'outside-pavamâna,'--so called because (on the first day of a Soma-sacrifice) it is performed outside the altar (commentary on Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>av. Br. VI, 8, 10-11; or outside the Sadas, Sây. on Sâmav. S. p. 47),--is chanted in the Triv<i>ri</i>t, or threefold, stoma; consisting, as it does, of three gâyatrî triplets (Sâmav. II, 1-9 for the Agnish<i>t</i>oma), and none of its verses being chanted more than once. This stoma has three different varieties, viz. the udyatî, or ascending mode, the first turn of which consists of the first verses of the three triplets, the second turn of the second verses, and the third turn of the last verses, hence a<sup>1</sup> a<sup>2</sup> a<sup>3</sup>--b<sup>1</sup> b<sup>2</sup> b<sup>3</sup>--c<sup>1</sup> c<sup>2</sup> c<sup>3</sup>; the parivartinî, or reverting mode, following the natural order, a<sup>1</sup> b<sup>1</sup> c<sup>1</sup>--a<sup>2</sup> b<sup>2</sup> c<sup>2</sup>--a<sup>3</sup> b<sup>3</sup> c<sup>3</sup>; and the kulâyinî, or web-like mode, performed in the order a<sup>1</sup> b<sup>1</sup> c<sup>1</sup>-b<sup>2</sup> c<sup>2</sup> a<sup>2</sup>--c<sup>3</sup> a<sup>3</sup> b<sup>3</sup>. Cf. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 237, where, however, these forms are described quite differently. The term used for the natural order of verses in the parivartinî vish<i>t</i>uti is 'parâ<i>k</i>î,' i.e. thitherwards, straight off. From the statement in <a href="sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:7">paragraph 7</a> above, that 'they chant straight off (parâk),' one might therefore infer that that particular mode of chanting ought to be used for the Bahishpavamâna-stotra; but the term 'parâk' may also be taken as referring to each of the several verses being chanted 'straight off,' without any repetition. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 120 note, remarks: 'Each of these verses is for the purpose of chanting divided into four parts: <i>Prastâva</i>, i, e. prelude, the first being preceded by <i>hum̃</i>, to be sung by the Prastotar; <i>Udgîtha</i>, the principal part of the Sâman, preceded by <i>Om</i>, to be chanted by the Udgâtar; the <i>Pratihâra</i>, i.e. response [? rather check, stop; cf. <a href="sbe2653.htm#4:3:4:22">IV, 3, 4, 22</a>], introduced by <i>hum̃</i>, to be chanted by the Pratihartar; and the <i>Nidhana</i>, i.e. finale, to be sung by all three. To give the student an idea of this division, I here subjoin the second of these <i>ri</i><i>k</i>as in the Sâman form, distinguishing its four parts:--</p>  
 <p>[The connected <i>ri</i><i>k</i> form is: Abhi te madhunâ payo--atharvâ<i>n</i>o a<i>s</i>i<i>s</i>rayur--deva<i>m</i> devâya devayu.]</p>  
 <p>'<i>Prastâva:</i> abhi te madhunâ payo<i>m</i>.</p>

 <p>'<i>Pratihâra:</i> hu<i>m</i> âvâyo.</p>  
 <p>'<i>Nidhana:</i> sâm.</p>  
 <p>The Nidhanas, i.e. finales, are for the nine Pavamâna-stotra verses the following ones: sât, sâm, suvâ<i>h</i>, i<i>d</i>â, vâk, and â (for the four last verses).' See also Burnell, Ârsheyabr. p. xlv seq.</p>

VI, 7 seq. give the following details: The Prastot<i>ri</i> takes the prastara (bunch of grass, representing the Sacrificer) from the Adhvaryu and says, 'Brahman, we will chant, O Pra<i>s</i>âstar!' The Brahman and Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a having given their assent (Â<i>s</i>v. V, 2, 12-14). the Prastot<i>ri</i> hands the prastara to the Udgât<i>ri</i>. The latter touches his right thigh with it (or bends his right knee thereon) and 'harnesses' (introduces) the chant by the formula, 'with Agni's fire, with Indra's might, with Sûrya's brilliance, may B<i>ri</i>haspati harness thee,' &amp;c. (Tâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>ya Br. I, 3, 5); whereupon he mutters, 'I will make food,' &amp;c. (ib. 6); and after looking towards the pit and a vessel of water and the sun. he commences the chant. The three chanters are seated west of the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> (who look towards them), viz. the Udgât<i>ri</i> facing the north, the Prastot<i>ri</i> the west, and the Pratihart<i>ri</i> the south (or south-east). To the west of them are seated three, four, or six subordinate singers, or choristers (upagât<i>ri</i>), who accompany the chanting in a deep voice with the sound 'Ho.' When the chant is completed, the Udgât<i>ri</i> says, 'I have made food,' and makes the sacrificer mutter the formula, 'Thou art a falcon,' &amp;c. (Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. I, 3, 8); whereupon he takes a stalk of grass from the prastara, cuts off the top and bottom, so as to make it of the length of four thumbs’ breadths, and throws it into the pit with, 'If it has been chanted,' &amp;c. (ib. II, 1, 8). They then pour out the vessel of water into the pit, with, 'I send you to the sea,' &amp;c., and make 3, 5, 7 or 9 steps northwards outside the altar, <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a> whereupon they betake themselves to the Âgnîdhrîya.
