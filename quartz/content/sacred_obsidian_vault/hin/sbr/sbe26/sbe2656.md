 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:1">4:4:2:1</a></font></span>1. He proceeds with (the offering of) Soma's rice-pap; for Soma is the sacrificial food of the gods; and here now sacrificial food is prepared for Soma on his part; and thus Soma is not excluded therefrom. It is a rice-pap (<i>k</i>aru), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice, and boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:2">4:4:2:2</a></font></span>2. Neither at the morning feast, nor at the midday feast does he offer it, for those two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are the exclusive feasts of the gods; and Soma is sacred to the Fathers <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:3">4:4:2:3</a></font></span>3. But were he to offer it at the morning feast, or at the midday feast, he would cause discord between the gods and Fathers. He offers it at the evening feast, because the evening feast belongs to the All-gods <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">2</font></a>: thus he does not cause discord. He recites no invitatory prayer (but only an offering prayer), for the Fathers have passed away once for all: hence he recites no invitatory prayer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:4">4:4:2:4</a></font></span>4. Having, in the first place, taken ghee in four ladlings, and having called (on the Agnîdh) for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!' and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered. Whatever oblations have been offered previous to this (<i>k</i>aru), therefrom he separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:5">4:4:2:5</a></font></span>5. Having poured (into the spoon) an 'underlayer' of ghee, he makes two cuttings from the rice-pap; and bastes them with ghee above. Having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the Saumya (rice-pap)!' and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:6">4:4:2:6</a></font></span>6. He then takes ghee a second time by four ladlings, and having called for the <i>S</i>rausha<i>t</i>, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!' and offers as the Vasha<i>t</i> is uttered. From whatever oblations he intends to offer hereafter, he thereby separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord. If he chooses, he may offer (ghee) on both sides (before and after the Soma's rice-pap); or, if he chooses, he may offer on one side only <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:7">4:4:2:7</a></font></span>7. Now there is an offering-spoon called 'pra<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î.' Therein the Adhvaryu takes ghee by four ladlings (with the dipping-spoon) and pours it on the Dhish<i>n</i>ya hearths by means of fagots (held over them). The reason why he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots is this. Because, on a former occasion <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the gods said to those (Gandharva</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Soma-wardens), 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering,' that same offering of ghee now falls to their share at the evening pressing, but not one of Soma, in that he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots. One after another, in the order in which they were thrown up, and with the same formulas <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he pours ghee upon them; on the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya last of all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:8">4:4:2:8</a></font></span>8. Now some make a second pouring on the Âgnîdhrîya hearth, thinking, 'In the North (or upwards) shall this sacred work of ours be accomplished!' but let him not do it in this way, but rather the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya last <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:9">4:4:2:9</a></font></span>9. Now, while the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots, the Pratiprasthât<i>ri</i> draws the Pâtnîvata <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">3</font></a> cup. For from the sacrifice creatures are produced; and being produced from the sacrifice, they are produced from union; and being produced from union, they are produced from the hind part of the sacrifice;--hence he thereby produces them from a productive union, from the hind part of the sacrifice: therefore he draws the Pâtnîvata cup.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:10">4:4:2:10</a></font></span>10. He draws it with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel. If he</p>

 <p>draws the Sâvitra libation with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel, (he draws) this one with the Antaryâma vessel; and if he draws the Sâvitra with the Antaryâma vessel (he draws) this one with the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u vessel;--for one and the same indeed are the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma, being breath, and that which is the out-breathing is also the in-breathing. Now the breath (prâ<i>n</i>a, masc.) is male, and the wife is female: a productive union is thus brought about.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:11">4:4:2:11</a></font></span>11. He draws it without a puroru<i>k</i> <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">1</font></a>,---the puroru<i>k</i> being manhood,--lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he draws it without a puroru<i>k</i>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:12">4:4:2:12</a></font></span>12. He thus draws it from that (Âgraya<i>n</i>a graha) with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 9), 'Thou art taken with a support: Of thee, divine Soma, begotten by B<i>ri</i>haspati'--B<i>ri</i>haspati is the priesthood: of thee, divine Soma, the priest-begotten' he thereby means to say--'Of thee, the potent juice of the powerful (manly) juice' he means to say when he says 'of thee, the potent juice'--'May I prosper the draughts of thee, the mated one <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' he does not now draw it for the wives, lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he does not now draw it for the wives.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:13">4:4:2:13</a></font></span>13. He (the Adhvaryu) then mixes it with the residue (of ghee) which is left in the pra<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>î spoon. Now other libations he completes by mixing, but this one he diminishes; for ghee is a thunderbolt,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 367</font></a></p>  
 <p>and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods smote the wives and unmanned them, and thus smitten and unmanned they neither owned any self nor did they own any heritage. And in like manner does he now, by that thunderbolt, the ghee, smite the wives and unman them; and thus smitten and unmanned, they neither own <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">1</font></a> any self nor do they own any heritage.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:14">4:4:2:14</a></font></span>14. He mixes it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 9), 'I am above, I am below; and what space there is between, that was my father;--I saw the sun on both sides: I am what is highest to the gods in secret.' In that he mixes with 'I--I,' thereby he bestows manhood on men.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:15">4:4:2:15</a></font></span>15. He then says, 'Agnîdh, pronounce the offering prayer of the Pâtnîvata!' The Agnîdh is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about. He offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 10), 'O Agni, wife-leader <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">2</font></a>!'--Agni is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:16">4:4:2:16</a></font></span>16. 'Together with the divine Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'--for Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> transforms the cast seed: thus he thereby transforms the cast seed;--'drink the Soma, Hail!' therewith he offers on the north (left) part (of the fire); what other offerings there are, they are the gods, and these are the wives: thus alone it is a proper union, since the woman lies on the left (north) side of the man. The Adhvaryu takes a draught of Soma to the Agnîdh, and the latter says, 'Adhvaryu, invite me!' [It might be said</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 368</font></a></p>  
 <p>that] he should not invite him, since how can there be an invitation of one smitten and unmanned? He should nevertheless invite him: they offer in his fire, and utter the Vasha<i>t</i>,--therefore he should invite him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:17">4:4:2:17</a></font></span>17. He then gives orders, 'Agnîdh, sit in the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s lap! Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>, lead up the lady, and make her exchange looks with the Udgât<i>ri</i>! Unnet<i>ri</i>, fill up the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup, and let no Soma-juice remain!' Thus, if it be an Agnish<i>t</i>oma sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:4:2:18">4:4:2:18</a></font></span>18. But if it be an Ukthya <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">1</font></a>, let him say, 'Lengthen out the Soma!'--Holding the same vessel (from which the Pâtnîvata libation was made, the Agnîdh) sits down in the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i>'s lap,--for he, the Agnîdh, is in reality Agni, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> is female: the Agnîdh is male, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> female,--a productive union is thus brought about. The Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> leads up the lady and makes her exchange looks with the Udgât<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with 'Thou art Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the</p>

 <p>male, the bestower of seed: lay thou seed into me!' The Udgât<i>ri</i> is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the lady is a woman: a productive union is thus brought about.</p>

The Unnet<i>ri</i> puts down the <i>k</i>amasa cups behind the high altar, and pours into them the entire Soma-juice remaining in the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t, putting but little into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup, to leave room in it for the dhruva libation. Besides this the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is the only Soma that remains. The Adhvaryu then, by touching the Soma in the Hot<i>ri</i>'s cup with two stalks of grass, gives the signal for the chanting of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma Sâman (viz. the Ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>âya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>îya, Sâmav. II, 53, 54), wrapping up his head, if he chooses, in the same way as the Udgât<i>ri</i>s. Meanwhile the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> leads up the lady through the back door into the Sadas, makes her sit down north of the Udgât<i>ri</i> and exchange looks with the latter three times (at the 'Hi<i>m</i>,' see <a href="sbe2649.htm#page_308">p. 308</a>, note <a href="sbe2649.htm#fn_745">2</a>). Three times also (at every Nidhana) she uncovers her right leg and pours on it some of the pânne<i>g</i>anî water fetched by her in the morning (see <a href="sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:27">III, 9, 3, 27</a>), <a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 369</font></a> whereupon she returns to her own tent. Then follows the recitation of the Âgnimâruta <i>s</i>astra, consisting of the following parts:--</p>  
 <p></p><dir>Sûkta (hymn), Rig-veda III, 3, to Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara, with Nivid ('May Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara feast on this Soma,' &amp;c.) inserted before the last verse.

 <p>Sûkta to Agni <i>G</i>âtavedas, I, 143, with Nivid before the last verse.</p>  
 <p>Tristich to Âpa<i>h</i> (waters), X, 9, 1-3, recited in breaks, the Hot<i>ri</i> having previously uncovered his head (as do the other priests) and touched water, and the others holding on to him from behind.

 <p>At the Ukthya (and other Soma-sacrifices) the Ukthya graha is drawn immediately after the drawing of the Âgraya<i>n</i>a (see <a href="sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:24">IV, 3, 5, 24</a>, with note). Previous to the after-offerings the Ukthya graha is divided, as at the morning and midday performances (see <a href="sbe2647.htm#page_293">p. 293</a>, note <a href="sbe2647.htm#fn_706">2</a>), between the three Hotrakas, with a view to the recitation of their <i>s</i>astras which form the distinctive feature of the Ukthya sacrifice, bringing up the number of <i>s</i>astras (and stotras) from twelve (of the Agnish<i>t</i>oma) to fifteen. Besides, the Ukthya requires the immolation of at least two victims on the Soma-day, viz. a he-goat to Indra and Agni, besides the one to Agni.</p>
