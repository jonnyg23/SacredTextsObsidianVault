 <p>joints were relaxed: with his relaxed joints he was unable to raise himself. Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this Mahâvratîya (cup) and drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:4:2">4:6:4:2</a></font></span>2. With his joints thus restored, he approached this food, what food of Pra<i>g</i>âpati there is,--for what eating is to men, that the vrata (fast-food, or religious observance generally) is to the gods. And because (they say), 'Great, indeed, is this vrata whereby he has raised himself,' therefore it is called Mahâvratîya.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:4:3">4:6:4:3</a></font></span>3. Now, even as Pra<i>g</i>âpati then was, when he had created the living beings, so are those who sit (in sacrificial session) for a year; and as Pra<i>g</i>âpati then, after a year, approached food, so do they now, after a year, approach food, for whomsoever that knows this, they draw that cup.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:4:4">4:6:4:4</a></font></span>4. Let him draw it for Indra Vim<i>ri</i>dh (the Averter of scorn), for, verily, the scorners of those who sit for</p>

 <p>a year are smitten, and all is won by them: hence for Indra Vim<i>ri</i>dh,--with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 44; Rig-veda X, 152, 4), 'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra, lay them low that war against us, and send them, that persecute us, to the nethermost darkness!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Vim<i>ri</i>dh!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Vim<i>ri</i>dh!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:6:4:5">4:6:4:5</a></font></span>5. Or for Vi<i>s</i>vakarman (the All-worker), for all work is done, everything is won by those who sit in session for a year: hence for Vi<i>s</i>vakarman,--with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. VIII, 45; Rig-veda X, 81, 7), 'Vâ<i>k</i>aspati Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, the thought-speeder <a name="fr_1002"></a><a href="#fn_996"><font size="1">1</font></a>, let us invoke for protection in our struggle <a name="fr_1003"></a><a href="#fn_997"><font size="1">2</font></a> this day: may he, the all-beneficient worker of good, delight in all our offerings <a name="fr_1004"></a><a href="#fn_998"><font size="1">3</font></a> for our protection!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Vi<i>s</i>vakarman <a name="fr_1005"></a><a href="#fn_999"><font size="1">4</font></a>!--This is thy womb; thee to Indra Vi<i>s</i>vakarman!'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_995"></a><a href="sbe2673.htm#fr_1001">429:2</a> The drawing of this cup forms part of the performance of the last but one day of the Gavâm ayana, the so-called Mahâvrata (great vow) day, on which the following particulars are supplied by Kâtyâyana XIII, 2, 16 seq. The particular form of sacrifice prescribed for the day is the Agnish<i>t</i>oma. A victim to Pra<i>g</i>âpati is to be immolated. The Mahâvratîya-graha is drawn as an additional libation (like the Atigrâhyas,). The signal for the chanting of the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras is given by (a Brâhman) playing, with a rattan plectrum, on a harp with a hundred strings of <a name="page_430"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 430</font></a> Mu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a grass. During the chanting and recitation, the Udgât<i>ri</i> sits on an arm-chair, the Hot<i>ri</i> on a hammock or swing, the Adhvaryu on a board, and the other priests on cushions of grass. Then follow several curious ceremonies, performed partly inside and partly outside the Vedi. The performance of the Sattra is alternately lauded and vituperated by two persons [the one, a Brâhman, seated at the front door of the Sadas; the other, a <i>S</i>ûdra, at the back door; both facing each other;--thus Lâ<i>t</i>y. IV, 3, according to which authority, however, they are merely to say respectively, 'These Sattrins have not succeeded!'--'They have succeeded!'] At the same time a harlot and a theological student (brahma<i>kh</i>ârin) upbraid one another (in front of the Âgnîdhrîya fire shed); while (south of the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya) a sham contest takes place between an Ârya (Vai<i>s</i>ya) and a <i>S</i>ûdra for the possession of a round white skin, the <i>S</i>ûdra having to give in (after the third effort, when the Ârya beats him with the skin). Thereupon a couple is shut up in an enclosed space south of the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya (or behind the Âgnîdhrîya, Lâ<i>t</i>y.) for maithuna.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_997"></a><a href="sbe2673.htm#fr_1003">431:2</a> For the different meanings of 'vâ<i>g</i>a' see Max Müller, 'India, what can it teach us?' p. 164.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_998"></a><a href="sbe2673.htm#fr_1004">431:3</a> Or, in all our invocations (havana).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_999"></a><a href="sbe2673.htm#fr_1005">431:4</a> The identification of Vi<i>s</i>vakarman with Indra was probably suggested by the final pâda of the preceding verse of the hymn (Rig-veda X, 81, 6): 'May there be (or may he, Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, be) for us a Sûri Maghavan' (a rich patron; terms frequently applied to Indra). But cp. Muir, O. S. T. vol. iv, p. 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1000"></a><a href="sbe2673.htm#fr_1006">431:5</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text does not give the verse, but remarks merely,--But if he can get (vindet) an aindrî vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>î (verse), let him draw it therewith.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1001"></a><a href="sbe2673.htm#fr_1007">432:1</a> I see no other way of rendering 'yathâ-asat' in this passage.</p>
