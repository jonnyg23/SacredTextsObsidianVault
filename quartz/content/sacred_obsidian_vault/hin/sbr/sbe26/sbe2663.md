Of them, being all alike, all good, three desired, 'May we be superior <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">3</font></a>!'--Agni, Indra, and Sûrya.</p>

Let him draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgraya<i>n</i>a; for the Âgraya<i>n</i>a is the self (body), and many parts of this self are one each (and thus) over and above (the others), such as the lung <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">1</font></a> and heart, and others.</p>

Or he might draw them from the Pûtabh<i>ri</i>t, at the midday pressing, after drawing the Ukthya, or when about to bespeak (the chant), for the Ukthya indeed is the same as that undefined self of his. But this is mere speculation: let him rather draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgraya<i>n</i>a.</p>

They are offered after the offering of the Mâhendra graha; for that, the Mâhendra, is Indra's special cup; and so are the (Nishkevalya) stotra and <i>s</i>astra specially his. But the sacrificer is Indra; and for the sacrificer's benefit (these cups) are drawn: therefore they are offered after the offering of the Mâhendra graha.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_935"></a><a href="sbe2663.htm#fr_943">402:2</a> The Dvâda<i>s</i>âha, or twelve days’ performance, forms the connecting link between the so-called Ahîna sacrifices (consisting of between two and twelve press-days) and the sattras, or sacrificial sessions (of twelve press-days and upwards); since it can be performed as one or the other. As a sattra (which seems to be its usual character) it consists of the Da<i>s</i>arâtra, or ten nights’ (or days’) period, preceded and followed by an Atirâtra, as the prâya<i>n</i>îya (opening) and udayanîya (concluding) days. The Da<i>s</i>arâtra, on its part, consists of three tryahas (or tridua), viz. a P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha (see note  <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">4</font></a>), and three Ukthya days, the so-called <i>Kh</i>andomas (on which see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 347). These are followed by an Atyagnish<i>t</i>oma day, called Avivâkya (i.e. on which there should be 'no dispute, or quarrel').</p>
 <p><a name="fn_936"></a><a href="sbe2663.htm#fr_940">402:3</a> Ati-tish<i>th</i>âvâna<i>h</i>, lit. 'standing forth over (all others,' see <a href="sbe2662.htm#4:5:3:2">IV, 5, 3, 2</a>). In this, as in the preceding Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the prefix ati has to do service repeatedly for etymological and symbolical purposes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_937"></a><a href="sbe2663.htm#fr_942">402:4</a> I.e. cups of Soma 'to be drawn over and above' (Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 235; for a different explanation see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 490). These three grahas are required at the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha, which forms part of the Dvâda<i>s</i>âha (see note  <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">2</font></a>), and of sacrificial sessions generally. The sha<i>d</i>aha, or period of six Soma days, which (though itself consisting of two tryaha, or <a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a> tridua) may be considered as forming a kind of unit in sattras, or sacrificial sessions, is of two kinds, viz. the Abhiplava sha<i>d</i>aha and the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha. Both require (for the Hot<i>ri</i>'s p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotra at the midday pressing) the use of the Rathantara-sâman on uneven, and that of the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman on even days. The chief difference between them is that while the p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras of the Abhiplava are performed in the ordinary (Agnish<i>t</i>oma) way, the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha requires their performance in the proper p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a form, see <a href="sbe2652.htm#page_339">p. 339</a>, note <a href="sbe2652.htm#fn_801">2</a>. Besides, while the Abhiplava sha<i>d</i>aha consists of four Ukthya days, preceded and followed by one Agnish<i>t</i>oma day; the first day of the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya sha<i>d</i>aha is an Agnish<i>t</i>oma, the fourth a Sho<i>d</i>a<i>s</i>in, the remaining four days being Ukthyas. There is also a difference between the two in regard to the stomas, or forms of chanting, used; for while the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>ya requires successively one of the six principal stomas (from the Triv<i>ri</i>t up to the Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, as given <a href="sbe2649.htm#page_308">p. 308</a>, note <a href="sbe2649.htm#fn_745">2</a>) for each day, the Abhiplava requires the first four stomas (Triv<i>ri</i>t to Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a) for each day, though in a different order. In this respect, three groups or forms are assumed for the performance of the stotras at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma and Ukthya, viz. the <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma [a. Bahishpavavamâna in the Triv<i>ri</i>t; b. Â<i>g</i>yastotras and c. Mâdhyandina-pavamâna in the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a; d. the P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-stotras and e. Ârbhava-pavavamâna in the Saptada<i>s</i>a; and f. the Agnish<i>t</i>oma sâman in the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a stoma]; the Gosh<i>t</i>oma [a. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a; b. Triv<i>ri</i>t; c. Saptada<i>s</i>a; e. f. (and g. Ukthastotras) Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a]; and Âyush<i>t</i>oma [a. Triv<i>ri</i>t; b. Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a; c. d. Saptada<i>s</i>a; e. f. g. Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a]. These forms are distributed over the two tridua of the Abhiplava in the order: <i>G</i>yotish<i>t</i>oma, Gosh<i>t</i>oma, Âyush<i>t</i>oma; Gosh<i>t</i>oma, Âyush<i>t</i>oma, Gyotish<i>t</i>oma.</p>

As regards the Hot<i>ri</i>'s assistants, while the Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a always uses the same sâman, as at the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, viz. the Vâmadevya (II, 32-34), the sâmans used by the other Hotrakas are given in the Sâma-veda immediately after the respective sâman of the Hot<i>ri</i>, mentioned above.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_942"></a><a href="sbe2663.htm#fr_948">406:1</a> The Kâ<i>n</i>va text ascribes this practice to the <i>K</i>arakas.</p>
