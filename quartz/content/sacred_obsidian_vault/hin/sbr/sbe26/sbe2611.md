 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:1">3:3:1:1</a></font></span>1. He follows her, stepping into seven foot-prints of hers <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">2</font></a>; he thereby takes possession of her: that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were produced from Vâ<i>k</i> (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the <i>S</i>akvarî, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:2">3:3:1:2</a></font></span>2. It is as Vâ<i>k</i> <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">1</font></a> that he steps into them; (with the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 21), 'Thou art a Vasvî, thou art Aditi, thou art an Âdityâ, thou art a Rudrâ, thou art <i>K</i>andrâ; for she is indeed a Vasvî and Aditi, an Âdityâ, a Rudrâ, <i>K</i>andrâ. 'May B<i>ri</i>haspati make thee rest in happiness!'--B<i>ri</i>haspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, 'May B<i>ri</i>haspati lead thee hither by means of the good (work) <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' 'Rudra, together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:' this he says to secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:3">3:3:1:3</a></font></span>3. They now sit down <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">3</font></a> round the seventh footprint; and having laid down the piece of gold in the foot-print, he offers. For offering is made on nothing but fire, and the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: and thus that offering of his is indeed made over</p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>the fire. And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers her (the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by delivering her he makes her his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:4">3:3:1:4</a></font></span>4. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (with the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 22), 'On Aditi's head I pour thee;' for Aditi being this earth, it is on the head of the latter that he offers;--'on the worshipping-ground of the earth'--for on the worshipping-ground of the earth he indeed offers;--'Thou art I<i>d</i>â's footprint, filled with butter, Hail!' for I<i>d</i>â being the cow <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he indeed offers on the cow's foot-print; and 'filled with butter, Hail!' he says, because it indeed becomes filled with butter when offered upon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:5">3:3:1:5</a></font></span>5. Thereupon he takes the wooden sword and draws lines round (the foot-print): the wooden sword being a thunderbolt, it is with the thunderbolt that he draws round it. Thrice he draws round it, so that he encompasses it on all sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to trespass upon it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:6">3:3:1:6</a></font></span>6. He draws the lines (with the texts), 'Rejoice in us!' whereby he means to say, 'Rejoice in the sacrificer!' Having then, by tracing, cut out the foot-print all round <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he throws it into the pan, with, 'In us is thy kinship,' whereby he means to say, 'In the sacrificer is thy kinship.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:7">3:3:1:7</a></font></span>7. He then pours some water on (the place whence the earth has been removed). Wherever in digging they hurt her (the earth) and knock off anything</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p>  
 <p>from her,--water being (a means of) soothing,--that he now soothes by means of water, that he heals by means of water: that is why he pours water thereon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:8">3:3:1:8</a></font></span>8. He then hands (the dust of) the foot-print to the sacrificer, with, 'In thee is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'in thee is cattle.' The sacrificer receives it with, 'With me <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">1</font></a> is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'with me is cattle.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:9">3:3:1:9</a></font></span>9. The Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, 'May we not be deprived of prosperity!' Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself from (the possession of) cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:10">3:3:1:10</a></font></span>10. Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the (sacrificer's) wife. The house being the wife's resting-place, he thereby establishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this reason he hands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:11">3:3:1:11</a></font></span>11. The Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> makes her say, 'Thine, thine <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">2</font></a> is wealth;' whereupon he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow. Now, Soma is a male, and the wife is a female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma: a productive union is thus effected;--this is why he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:12">3:3:1:12</a></font></span>12. He causes her to be looked at (while she pronounces the text, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IV, 23), 'I have seen eye to eye with the divine intelligence, with the far-seeing Dakshi<i>n</i>â: take</p>  
 <p>

 <p>not my life from me, neither will I take thine; may I obtain a hero <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">1</font></a> in thy sight!' She thereby asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means to say, 'May I obtain a son in thy sight!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:13">3:3:1:13</a></font></span>13. One that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-cow. For when Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u divided a thousand (cows) into three parts, there was one left <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and her they caused to propagate herself in three kinds; and hence, even now, if any one were to divide a thousand by three, one would remain over.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:14">3:3:1:14</a></font></span>14. The brown one, with red-brown eyes, is the Soma-cow; and that ruddy one is the V<i>ri</i>tra-killer's (India's) own, whom the king here chooses for himself <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">3</font></a> after winning the battle; and the ruddy one with reddish-white eyes <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">4</font></a> is the Fathers' own whom they slay here for the Fathers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:15">3:3:1:15</a></font></span>15. Let, then, the brown one, with red-brown eyes, be the Soma-cow. And if he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a dark-red <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">5</font></a> one. And if he be unable to obtain a dark-red one, let it be a ruddy one, one of the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> V<i>ri</i>tra-killer's own. But let him nowise turn his fancy upon a ruddy one with reddish-white eyes.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3:3:1:16">3:3:1:16</a></font></span>16. Let it be one that is not impregnated. For that Soma-cow is in reality Vâ<i>k</i>, and this Vâ<i>k</i> (speech) is of unimpaired vigour; and of unimpaired vigour is one not (yet) impregnated: let it therefore be one not impregnated. Let it be one that is neither tailless, nor hornless, nor one-eyed, nor ear-less <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">1</font></a>, nor specially marked, nor seven-hoofed <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--for such a one is uniform, and uniform is this speech.</p>

S. VI, 1, 8, 1 he steps into six foot-prints and offers on the seventh. According to Kâty. VII, 6, 17 they pass (or overstep, atikram) six foot-prints and sit down round the seventh.</p>

The Kâ<i>n</i>va text has the more acceptable reading, 'B<i>ri</i>haspati being the Brahman, and felicity the sacrifice, he thereby says, "May the Brahman make thee rest (or delight, ramayatu) in the good (work), the sacrifice!"'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_160"></a><a href="sbe2611.htm#fr_161">59:3</a> According to the comm. on Kâty. VII, 6, 17 the Brahman and the Sacrificer are to sit on the south, the Adhvaryu on the west, and the Nesh<i>t</i><i>ri</i> on the north side of the foot-print.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="sbe2611.htm#fr_163">60:2</a> According to the comm. on Kâty. VII, 6, 20, it would rather seem that he scratches with the sphya all over the foot-print and then takes out the loose dust (pâ<i>m</i>sûn) and throws it into the pan.</p>

The threefold division seems to refer to Vish<i>n</i>u's three steps, by which (as the sun) he measures the sky; or to the division of the universe into the three worlds (?). See also Ait. Br.
