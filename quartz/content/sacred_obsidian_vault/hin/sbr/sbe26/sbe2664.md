 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:1">4:5:5:1</a></font></span>1. Pra<i>g</i>âpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have been produced: and in like manner are they produced thereafter even to this day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:2">4:5:5:2</a></font></span>2. After the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u cup goats are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:3">4:5:5:3</a></font></span>3. After the Antâryama cup sheep are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_407"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 407</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:4">4:5:5:4</a></font></span>4. And because of those two (cups) which are together he offers the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u first, therefore, of goats and sheep when they are together <a name="fr_950"></a><a href="#fn_944"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the goats go first, and the sheep behind them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:5">4:5:5:5</a></font></span>5. And because, having offered the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u, he wipes (the vessel) upwards, therefore these goats walk like nimbly <a name="fr_951"></a><a href="#fn_945"><font size="1">2</font></a> climbing spokes.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:6">4:5:5:6</a></font></span>6. And because, having offered the Antaryâma, he wipes (the vessel) downwards, therefore these sheep walk with their heads down, as if digging. Now they, the goats and sheep, are most conspicuously Pra<i>g</i>âpati-like: whence, bringing forth thrice in the year, they produce two or three <a name="fr_952"></a><a href="#fn_946"><font size="1">3</font></a> (young ones).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:7">4:5:5:7</a></font></span>7. After <a name="fr_953"></a><a href="#fn_947"><font size="1">4</font></a> the <i>S</i>ukra cup men are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again. But the <i>S</i>ukra (bright) is the same as he that burns yonder, and he indeed is Indra; and of animals, man is Indra-like <a name="fr_954"></a><a href="#fn_948"><font size="1">5</font></a>: whence he rules over animals.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:8">4:5:5:8</a></font></span>8. After the <i>Ri</i>tu cup the one-hoofed species is produced. Now that (cup) is again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again. And such-like is the Ritu cup <a name="fr_955"></a><a href="#fn_949"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and suchlike the head of the one-hoofed. The Âgraya<i>n</i>a</p>

 <p>cup, the Ukthya cup, and the Âditya cup,--after them cows are produced. Now, these are again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:9">4:5:5:9</a></font></span>9. And because goats are produced after the fewest cups, therefore, though bringing forth thrice in a year, producing two or three, (they are) very few, for they are produced after the fewest cups.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:10">4:5:5:10</a></font></span>10. And because cows are produced after the most cups, therefore, though bringing forth once in a year, and producing one each time, (they are) most numerous, for they are produced after the most cups.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:11">4:5:5:11</a></font></span>11. Then, in the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a (trough) he finally draws the Hâriyo<i>g</i>ana graha. Now, the Dro<i>n</i>akala<i>s</i>a is Pra<i>g</i>âpati;--he turns unto these creatures, and fosters them, and kisses them <a name="fr_956"></a><a href="#fn_950"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he fosters them in that he produces them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:12">4:5:5:12</a></font></span>12. Now, these same cups after which creatures are produced, are five,--those of the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u and Antaryâma (counting as) one and the same, the <i>S</i>ukra cup, the <i>Ri</i>tu cup, the Âgraya<i>n</i>a cup, and the Ukthya cup; for there are five seasons in the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra<i>g</i>âpati. But if there be six seasons in the year, then the Âditya cup is the sixth of them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:5:5:13">4:5:5:13</a></font></span>13. But indeed there is only that one cup after which creatures are produced here, to wit, the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u cup; for the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u is breath, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is breath, and everything here is after Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>
