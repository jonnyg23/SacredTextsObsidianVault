 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:2">4:3:2:2</a></font></span>2. [The Hot<i>ri</i>] calls upon that (Adhvaryu) seated (before him) with his face towards the east <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_775"><font size="1">1</font></a>. For all</p>

 <p>others except the Udgât<i>ri</i> perform their priestly duties while facing the east, and in this manner that priestly duty of his is performed towards the east.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:3">4:3:2:3</a></font></span>3. Now the Udgât<i>ri</i> is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and the Hot<i>ri</i>, (being) the <i>Ri</i>k (fem.), is a female. And when he chants, then the Udgât<i>ri</i>, Pra<i>g</i>âpati, implants seed in the female Hot<i>ri</i>, the <i>Ri</i>k; this the Hot<i>ri</i> brings forth by means of the <i>s</i>astra (recitation), he sharpens</p>  
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p>it even as this man is sharpened <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_776"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and because he thereby sharpens (<i>s</i>o) therefore it is called sastra.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:4">4:3:2:4</a></font></span>4. Having turned round (so as to face the Hot<i>ri</i>, the Adhvaryu) then responds: thereby he quickens <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">2</font></a> that implanted seed. On the other hand, were he to respond while standing with his face turned away (from the Hot<i>ri</i>), that implanted seed would assuredly perish away, and would not be brought forth; but thus facing each other (the male and female) bring forth the implanted seed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:5">4:3:2:5</a></font></span>5. Now the strength of the metres was exhausted by the gods, for it was by the metres that the gods attained the world of heaven. And the response (song) is ecstasy (mada <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">3</font></a>)--what ecstasy there is in the <i>ri</i><i>k</i> and that which there is in the Sâman, that is sap: this sap he now lays into the metres, and thus makes the metres of restored strength; and with them of restored strength they perform the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:6">4:3:2:6</a></font></span>6. Hence if (the Hot<i>ri</i>) recites by half-verses, let (the Adhvaryu) respond at each half-verse; and if he recites by pâdas (hemistichs), let him respond at each pâda. For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) draws breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer's enemies.</p>

Then <i>G</i>agatî flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind three syllables. Then Trish<i>t</i>ubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable. Then Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those syllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables: wherefore they say, 'Gâyatrî is octosyllabic.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:8">4:3:2:8</a></font></span>8. With her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--whence the morning feast pertains to Gâyatrî. With her they performed the midday feast. Trish<i>t</i>ubh then said to her, 'To thee will I come with three syllables: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Trish<i>t</i>ubh came to consist of eleven syllables, and therefore they say, 'The midday Soma feast pertains to Trish<i>t</i>ubh.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:9">4:3:2:9</a></font></span>9. With her (Gâyatrî) indeed they performed the evening feast. <i>G</i>agatî then said to her, 'To thee will I come with one syllable: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the <i>G</i>agatî came to consist of twelve syllables; and therefore they say, 'The evening Soma feast pertains to <i>G</i>agatî.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:10">4:3:2:10</a></font></span>10. As to this they say, 'Surely all the Soma feasts pertain to Gâyatrî, since Gâyatrî alone went on increasing.' At the morning feast he should therefore respond with a complete (formula), for complete <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_779"><font size="1">1</font></a> Gâyatrî returned. At the midday feast</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4:3:2:13">4:3:2:13</a></font></span>13. Now some respond with 'Othâmo daiva vâk,' saying, 'The response is speech (vâk): thus we obtain speech.' But let him not do this; for surely, in whichsoever way he may respond, speech is obtained by him, since he responds by speech. Let him therefore respond with 'Om <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' only, for that is truth, that the gods know.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_775"></a><a href="sbe2651.htm#fr_778">326:1</a> While the Adhvaryu sits before the Sadas, with his back to the Hot<i>ri</i> (<a href="sbe2650.htm#page_322">p. 322</a>, note <a href="sbe2650.htm#fn_771">1</a>), the latter performs the (tûsh<i>n</i>îm-) <i>g</i>apa--i.e. the muttering of the formula 'May Father Mâtari<i>s</i>van grant flawless (verse-) feet! may the bards sing flawless hymns!' &amp;c. Ait. Br. II, 38; Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>r. V, 9, 1--after which he addresses to the Adhvaryu his call (âhâva), '<i>s</i>õ<i>m</i>sâvõm (let us two recite, Om)!'--which formula is used at all <i>s</i>astras, except that, at the midday and evening libations, it is preceded by 'Adhvaryo' (O Adhvaryu); while at the evening savana the first syllable of the verb is repeated, thus '<i>s</i>o<i>s</i>o<i>m</i>sâvo.'--The Adhvaryu rises, turns round so as to face the Hot<i>ri</i>, and responds by '<i>s</i>o<i>m</i>sâmo daiva (we recite, O divine one)!' According to Ait. Br. III, 12, the Âhâva and Pratigara together are to consist of the number of syllables corresponding to the metre of the respective libation, viz. 8, 11, 12 respectively. Then follows the Hot<i>ri</i>s Tûsh<i>n</i>î<i>m</i>-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>sa or 'silent praise;' viz. 'Earth! Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Om!--Indra is the light, Ether! the light is Indra, Om! Sûrya is the light, the light, Heaven! is Sûrya, Om!'--This is followed by a Puroru<i>k</i>, or preliminary invocation of a deity, recited in a loud voice, (and consisting of twelve short formulas resembling the Nivid part i, p. 114, note 2; ib. I, 4, 2, 5 seq.), which, indeed, takes its place in the <i>s</i>astras of the midday and evening libations, being inserted in the middle or before the last verse of the hymn of the <i>s</i>astra; viz. Agni kindled by the gods, Agni kindled by man, Agni the well-kindling, the Hot<i>ri</i> chosen by the gods, the Hot<i>ri</i> chosen by men, the carrier of offerings, the leader of sacrifices, the irresistible Hot<i>ri</i>, the swift carrier of oblations: may he, the god, <a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a> bring hither the gods! may Agni, the god, worship the gods! may (Agni), the knower of beings, perform the sacrificial rites!' (Ait. Br. II, 34.) Then follows the hymn, the Â<i>g</i>ya-sûkta, the chief part of the <i>s</i>astra, viz. Rig-veda III, 13, 'To him, your god Agni, will I sing with loudest voice; may he come hither to us with the gods; may he, the best offerer, sit down on our sacred grass!' &amp;c.; the seven (anush<i>t</i>ubh) verses of which are recited in the order 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7. The first and last verses being, however, repeated thrice, the number is thus raised to eleven. The recitation of the hymn is followed by the so-called ukthavîrya ('the strength of the praise'), consisting of the formula uktha<i>m</i> vâ<i>k</i>i, 'praise hath been sung,' with some words added to it differing at different <i>s</i>astras,--at the present <i>s</i>astra 'ghoshâya tvâ,' 'thee (I have recited) for sound (praise)!' [for school-differences as to these formulas, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 177],--to which the Adhvaryu responds, 'Om ukthasâ<i>h</i>,' 'yea, singer of praise!' The Ukthavîrya, together with the response, is again to consist of as many syllables as the characteristic metre of the respective libation. Then follows the recitation, by the Âgnîdhra (Ait. Br. VI, 14), of the yâ<i>g</i>yâ or offering prayer, viz. Rig-veda III, 25, 4.--As regards the term 'â<i>g</i>ya,' the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>. Br. VII, 2, 1, 2, derives it from â<i>g</i>i, a race, in accordance with the following legend: When Pra<i>g</i>âpati offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods, the latter could not agree as to which of them should have the first share. Pra<i>g</i>âpati then proposed that they should run a race for it. In this race Agni came off first, then Mitravaruna, then Indra. To each of these three divinities an â<i>g</i>ya was thereupon assigned; and, by a secret understanding between Indra and Agni, these two divided the fourth â<i>g</i>ya between them. Hence the âgneya, maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a, aindra, and aindrâgna <i>s</i>astra (and stotra), belonging to the Hot<i>ri</i>, Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a, Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin, and A<i>kh</i>âvâka priests respectively.</p>

The response (pratigara) here alluded to, is probably the one ordinarily used by the Adhvaryu, whenever the Hot<i>ri</i> pauses in his recitation, at the end of half-verses <a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a> (or pâdas), nivids, &amp;c., viz.

 <p><a name="fn_781"></a><a href="sbe2651.htm#fr_784">330:2</a> According to Kâty. X, 6, 6 'madâmo daiva' is optionally the Adhvaryu's response at the recitation in the Âgnimârutra <i>S</i>astra of three of the so-called Anupânîya (or Svâdushkilîya) trish<i>t</i>ubh verses VI, 47, 1-4 (see note on <a href="sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18">IV, 4, 2, 18</a>). Possibly the present paragraph may refer to those verses, in which case the words 'when trish<i>t</i>ubh verses are recited' would begin a fresh paragraph. Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, seems to take it in the same way as above; cf. also the Kâ<i>n</i>va reading in next note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_782"></a><a href="sbe2651.htm#fr_785">330:3</a> This is the (<i>G</i>agatî) hymn I, 159 recited in the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva Sastra. According to Kâty.

The Kâ<i>n</i>va has for paragraphs 10-12, 'At the morning feast he responds by a complete (formula), for complete Gâyatrî returned. At the midday feast he responds once with one containing "mad," when he <a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a> recites trish<i>t</i>ubh verses, for she (Trish<i>t</i>ubh) returned leaving one syllable behind: hereby now he completes her, makes her whole.

At the (hymn) to Heaven and Earth he responds with one that contains "mad;" when he recites (the hymn) Heaven and Earth--these creatures subsisting on those two, Heaven and Earth--he thereby puts juice into them, and upon those two, thus rendered juiceful, these creatures subsist. He responds with "Om," for that is truth, that the gods know.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_783"></a><a href="sbe2651.htm#fr_786">331:1</a> That is, instead of 'vâk,' hence 'Othâmo daivom.' 'Om' pure and simple is the response at the end of the <i>s</i>astra.</p>
