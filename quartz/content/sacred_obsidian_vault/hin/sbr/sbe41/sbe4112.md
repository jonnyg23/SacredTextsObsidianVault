 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:1">5:2:5:1</a></font></span>1. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u, a pap for Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u, and either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<i>n</i>u. He performs that Trisha<i>m</i>yukta <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">1</font></a> offering. Therewith the gods came by men, and in like manner does this (king) now thereby come by men.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:2">5:2:5:2</a></font></span>2. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish<i>n</i>u;--Agni is the giver, and men are Vish<i>n</i>u's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the king) men.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:3">5:2:5:3</a></font></span>3. And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Vish<i>n</i>u;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and men are Vish<i>n</i>u's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Sacrificer) men; he now puts himself in contact with them, makes them his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:4">5:2:5:4</a></font></span>4. And as to why there is either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<i>n</i>u;--whatever men Agni, the giver, gives him, among them he thereby finally establishes him (the king); and whatever work he wishes to do with his men, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby approaches the men, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, and possessed of men!' A dwarfish bull is the sacrificial fee for this (offering), for the dwarf belongs to Vish<i>n</i>u <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:5">5:2:5:5</a></font></span>5. He then performs another Trisha<i>m</i>yukta offering. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Pûshan, a pap for Indra and Pûshan, and a pap for Pûshan: this Trisha<i>m</i>yukta he offers. Thereby the gods obtained cattle; and in like manner does this (king) thereby obtain cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:6">5:2:5:6</a></font></span>6. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Pûshan; Agni is the giver, and the cattle are Pûshan's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:7">5:2:5:7</a></font></span>7. And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Pûshan;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and the cattle are Pûshan's: whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, those he makes his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:8">5:2:5:8</a></font></span>8. And why there is a pap for Pûshan;--whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he thereby finally establishes him, and whatever work he wishes to do with his cattle, that he is able</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>to do: thus he comes by cattle, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, possessed of cattle!' A dark-grey <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a> bull is the fee for this (offering), for such a dark-grey one is of Pûshan's nature: there are two forms of the dark-grey, the white hair and the black; and 'two and two' means a productive pair, and Pûshan represents productiveness, for Pûshan is cattle, and cattle means productiveness: thus a productive pair is obtained,--hence a dark-grey bull is the sacrificial fee.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:9">5:2:5:9</a></font></span>9. He then performs another Trisha<i>m</i>yukta offering. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma, a pap for Indra and Soma, and a pap for Soma: this Trisha<i>m</i>yukta (triply connected) he offers:--Thereby the gods attained glory; and in like manner does this (king) thereby attain glory.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:10">5:2:5:10</a></font></span>10. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma;--Agni is the giver, and Soma is glory: thus Agni, the giver, gives him glory.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:11">5:2:5:11</a></font></span>11. And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Soma;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and Soma is glory: whatever glory Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, that he makes his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:12">5:2:5:12</a></font></span>12. And why there is a pap for Soma;--whatever glory, Agni, the giver, gives him, therein he now finally establishes him; and whatever work he, the glorious, wishes to do, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby attains glory,--thinking, 'May I be consecrated, endowed with glory!' for the inglorious one has no concern with success. A brown bull is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a></p>  
 <p>the fee for this (offering); for such a brown one is of Soma's nature.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:13">5:2:5:13</a></font></span>13. And on the following day he prepares a cake-on twelve potsherds for (Agni) Vai<i>s</i>vânara, and a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a. These two offerings he performs either on days following one another, or so as to use the same barhis <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:14">5:2:5:14</a></font></span>14. And as to why there is that (cake) for Vai<i>s</i>vânara;--Vai<i>s</i>vânara ('belonging to all men') truly is the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year; and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed thereby created abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!' And in like manner does that (king) thereby create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:15">5:2:5:15</a></font></span>15. And why it is one on twelve potsherds;--twelve months there are in the year, and Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the year: this is why it is one on twelve potsherds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:16">5:2:5:16</a></font></span>16. And as to why there is a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a; he thereby frees the creatures from every snare of Varu<i>n</i>a, from all that comes from Varu<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">2</font></a>;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>and those creatures of his are produced sound and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for sound and faultless creatures (or subjects)!' he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:5:17">5:2:5:17</a></font></span>17. A bull is the fee for the Vai<i>s</i>vânara (oblation); for Vai<i>s</i>vânara is the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year; and the bull is the Pra<i>g</i>âpati (lord of creatures or generation) among cows: therefore a bull is the fee for the Vai<i>s</i>vânara. A black cloth for the Vâru<i>n</i>a (oblation), for what is black belongs to Varu<i>n</i>a. If he cannot obtain a black one, any kind of cloth will do: it is by its knots that the cloth belongs to Vanilla, for the knot is sacred to Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>

 <p></p><dir>1. Agnâvaish<i>n</i>ava cake, Aindrâvaish<i>n</i>ava pap, Vaish<i>n</i>ava pap;<br> 2. Agnâpaush<i>n</i>a cake, Aindrâpaush<i>n</i>a pap, Paush<i>n</i>a pap;<br> 3. Agnîshomîya cake, Aindrâsaumya pap, Samnya pap.</dir>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> In this way one of the three divinities for whom the offering is intended,--viz. Vish<i>n</i>u, Pûshan, and Soma,--is each time connected with the two head-gods, Agni and Indra.--In the Black Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, this set of offerings (not, however, called there by this name), is preceded by another ceremony consisting of five oblations to Dhât<i>ri</i>, Anumati, Râkâ, Sinîvâlî, and Kuhû. Taitt. S. I, 8, 8. Cf. <i>S</i>ât. Br. IX, 5, 1, 38.</p>

As regards the 'swearing by Varu<i>n</i>a (?)' there referred to, see <i>Ri</i>k S.
