 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:1">5:1:4:1</a></font></span>1. At the midday Soma-feast he consecrates (the Sacrificer) by sprinkling; and at the midday Soma-feast they run a race; for, verily, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is that sacrifice <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and indeed, they are even now produced after this one: thus he thereby wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati in the very centre (of the sacrifice).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:2">5:1:4:2</a></font></span>2. The Mâhendra cup being not yet drawn,--for</p>

 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>that, the Mâhendra, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so also are his that Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra; and the Sacrificer is Indra: thus he consecrates him at his own dwelling-place. Hence, the Mâhendra cup being not yet drawn,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:3">5:1:4:3</a></font></span>3. He takes down the chariot <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">1</font></a>, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 5), 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt;' for the chariot is indeed a thunderbolt, and the sacrificer is Indra: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt;'--'a winner of wealth,' for the chariot is indeed a winner of wealth;--'May this one win wealth by thee!'--wealth means food: 'may this one gain food by thee,' is what he thereby says.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:4">5:1:4:4</a></font></span>4. That chariot, seized by the pole, he turns (from left to right) so as to make it stand inside the vedi <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">2</font></a>, with, 'In the winning of wealth, the great Mother'--wealth means food: 'in the winning of food, the great Mother'--is what he thereby says;--'Aditi by name, we praise with speech;' now Aditi is this earth: therefore he says, 'Aditi by name, we praise with speech,'--'whereon all this being hath settled;' for indeed thereon all being here is settled;--'thereon may the divine Savit<i>ri</i> prosper our stay!' whereby he means to say, 'thereon may the divine Savit<i>ri</i> prosper our Sacrificer!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:5">5:1:4:5</a></font></span>5. He then sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or when brought</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>up after being watered. Now in the beginning the horse was produced from the water; while being produced from the water, it was produced incomplete, for it was indeed produced incomplete: hence it does not stand on all its feet, but it stands lifting one foot on each side. Thus what then was left behind of it in the water, therewith he now completes it, and makes it whole: therefore he sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or when brought up after being watered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:6">5:1:4:6</a></font></span>6. He sprinkles them, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. .IX, 6), 'Within the waters is ambrosia, in the waters is medicine: at the praises of the waters may ye wax strong, ye horses!' And with this also, 'O divine waters, what rushing, high-peaked, wealth-winning wave ye have, therewith may this one win wealth!' wealth is food: he thus says, 'May he thereby gain food!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:7">5:1:4:7</a></font></span>7. He then yokes (the team of) the chariot. The right horse he yokes (puts to) first; for in human (practice) they indeed put to the left horse first, but with the gods in this way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:8">5:1:4:8</a></font></span>8. He yokes it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 7), Either the wind, or thought--'for there is nothing swifter than the wind, and nothing swifter than thought:' therefore he says, 'Either the wind, or thought;--'(or) the seven and twenty Gandharvas <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>they yoked the horse at first;' for the Gandharvas indeed yoked the horse at first: 'May they who yoked the horse at first yoke thee!' this he thereby says they;--'laid speed into him,'--he thereby says, 'May they who laid speed into it, lay speed into thee!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:9">5:1:4:9</a></font></span>9. He then yokes the left horse, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 8), 'Become thou swift as the wind, O courser, being yoked!'--thereby he says, 'Become quick as the wind, O courser, being yoked;'--'be thou as Indra's right (steed) in beauty!'--he thereby says, 'Even as Indra's right (steed) for beauty, so be thou that of the sacrificer for beauty!'--'May the all-knowing Maruts yoke thee!' he thereby says, 'may gods yoke thee!'--'May Tvash<i>t</i><i>ri</i> lay speed into thy feet!' in this there is nothing obscure. He then yokes the right side-horse; for in human (practice) they indeed yoke the left side-horse first, but with the gods in this way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:10">5:1:4:10</a></font></span>10. He yokes it, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 9), 'What speed hath been secretly laid into thee, O courser, and what (speed), bestowed on the eagle, went along in the wind;'--he thereby says, 'what speed of thine, O courser, is hidden away even elsewhere, therewith win this our sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati!'--'with that strength be thou strong and wealth-winning for us, O courser, and victorious at the gathering!'--wealth means food: he thus means to say, 'And be thou a food-winner for us at this our</p>  
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>  
 <p>sacrifice, at the gathering of the gods win thou this sacrifice, Pra<i>g</i>âpati!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:11">5:1:4:11</a></font></span>11. Now only those three (horses) are yoked, for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke (laid) on the side-horse <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">1</font></a> goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot to the Adhvaryu), he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto. Hence also at any other sacrifice only those three (horses) are yoked; for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke of the side-horse goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot) away, he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:12">5:1:4:12</a></font></span>12. He now takes out material for a wild-rice pap of seventeen plates for B<i>ri</i>haspati; for he who offers the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya wins food,--vâ<i>g</i>a-peya being doubtless the same as anna-peya (food and drink): thus whatever food he has thereby won, that he now prepares for him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:13">5:1:4:13</a></font></span>13. And as to why it belongs to B<i>ri</i>haspati:--B<i>ri</i>haspati won it in the beginning, therefore it belongs to B<i>ri</i>haspati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:14">5:1:4:14</a></font></span>14. And why it is prepared of wild rice:--B<i>ri</i>haspati is the Brahman (priesthood), and those wild-rice grains are cooked with the Brahman (prayer),--therefore it is of wild rice. It is one of seventeen plates,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>because Pra<i>g</i>âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:1:4:15">5:1:4:15</a></font></span>15. He makes the horses smell it, with 'Ye coursers--;' for horses are coursers (vâ<i>g</i>in): therefore he says, 'Ye coursers,'--'wealth-winners,'--wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby says;--'starting upon the course;' for they are about to run a race;--'smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion!' for this indeed is B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion: therefore he says, 'smell ye B<i>ri</i>haspati's portion!' And why he makes the horses smell it: he thinks, 'may I win Him <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">1</font></a>!' therefore he makes the horses smell it.</p>

S. 1, 7, 7, 2; Kâ<i>th</i>aka 13, 14; Maitr. S. I, 11, 1) to contain the first allusion to the system of Nakshatras, or lunar mansions marking the daily stations occupied by the moon (masc.) during his circuit round the heavens.--In the ritual of the Black Ya<i>g</i>us (Taitt. S. 1, 7, 7, 2) <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a> this formula runs thus: 'Either Vâyu, or Manu, or the Gandharvas, the twenty-seven, harnessed the horse at first, laid speed into him,'--which Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, interprets as meaning, 'Vâyu, and Manu, and the (twenty-five) Gandharvas,--these seven and twenty. &amp;c.'</p>
