 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:1">5:2:4:1</a></font></span>1. He offers the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">1</font></a> (All-gods’ offering); for by means of the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, Pra<i>g</i>âpati created abundance (of food) and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, after creating abundance and creatures!' And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, by the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, after creating abundance and creatures!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:2">5:2:4:2</a></font></span>2. He then offers the Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsâ<i>h</i> <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for by means of the Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsâ<i>h</i> Pra<i>g</i>âpati delivered the creatures from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose, and those creatures of his were produced healthy and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for healthy, faultless creatures!'</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>he thought. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, by the Varu<i>n</i>apraghâsâ<i>h</i>, deliver the creatures from Varu<i>n</i>a's noose, and those creatures of his are produced healthy and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for healthy, faultless creatures!' so he thinks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:3">5:2:4:3</a></font></span>3. He then performs the Sâkamedhâ<i>h</i> <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for by the Sâkamedhâ<i>h</i> the gods slew V<i>ri</i>tra, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in, like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked, hateful enemy; and in like manner does he gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security are gained!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:4">5:2:4:4</a></font></span>4. He then performs the <i>S</i>unâsîrya <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">2</font></a>, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having encompassed both essences! Thereupon the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avâtîya <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">3</font></a> (oblation to the five winds). Having poked the Âhavanîya fire asunder into five parts, he offers, cutting out butter with the dipping-spoon.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:5">5:2:4:5</a></font></span>5. He offers in the forepart (of the fire), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 35), 'To the Agni-eyed gods, the east-seated, hail!' He then offers in the southern part</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>with, 'To the Yama-eyed <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">1</font></a> gods, the south-seated, hail!' He then offers in the hind part with, 'To the Vi<i>s</i>vadeva-eyed gods, the west-seated, hail!' He then offers in the northern part with either, 'To the Mitrâvaru<i>n</i>a-eyed gods,--or, To the Marut-eyed gods,--the north-seated, hail!' He then offers in the centre with, 'To the Soma-eyed gods, the above-seated; the venerable, hail!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:6">5:2:4:6</a></font></span>6. Having then poked (the fire) together, he offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 36), 'The gods that are Agni-eyed, east-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Yama-eyed, south-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Vi<i>s</i>vadeva-eyed, west-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Mitrâvaru<i>n</i>a-eyed--or, Marut-eyed--north-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Soma-eyed, above-seated, venerable, to them hail!' Now as to why he thus offers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:7">5:2:4:7</a></font></span>7. Now when, by means of the Sâkamedhâ<i>h</i>, the gods were gaining that universal conquest, which now is theirs, they said, 'Verily the fiends, the Rakshas, suck out these (creatures) in the (four) quarters: come, let us throw the thunderbolt at them!' Now the ghee is a thunderbolt: with that thunderbolt, the ghee, they smote the fiends, the Rakshas, in the (four) quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) smite the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters, by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus he gains the victory, thinking, 'May</p>

 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> I be consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:8">5:2:4:8</a></font></span>8. And as to why he offers those five latter oblations. Now when they poke the Âhavanîya asunder into five parts, thereby they wound and tear some of the fire; and hereby now he heals it: therefore he offers those five latter oblations.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:9">5:2:4:9</a></font></span>9. For this (offering) a carriage and pair, with a side horse, is the priest's fee. Three horses, the warrior, and the charioteer,--these are five breaths, and the breath is the same as the wind: and because that is the fee for this sacrifice, therefore it is called Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avâtîya (belonging to the five winds).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:10">5:2:4:10</a></font></span>10. He may also heal (some disease <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a>) with this (offering): For yonder blower (or purifier, the wind) is this breath; and the breath is the same as the vital energy. Now he (the wind) blows as one only, but on entering into man, he is divided tenfold; and ten are those oblations he offers: thus he (the priest) endows him with the ten vital airs, with the whole, entire vital energy; and were he now even as one whose vital spirit has departed, verily by this (offering) he (the priest) brings him round again.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:11">5:2:4:11</a></font></span>11. Thereupon the Indraturîya <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">2</font></a>.--There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a barley pap for Varu<i>n</i>a, a pap of gavedhukâ seed (coix barbata) for Rudra; and a mess of sour curds from a yoke-trained</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>cow for Indra: this Indraturîya he offers. Now Indra and Agni on that occasion consulted with each other: 'Verily the fiends, the Rakshas, suck out these (creatures) in the (four) quarters: come, let us throw the thunderbolt at them!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:12">5:2:4:12</a></font></span>12. Agni then spake, 'Let there be three shares for me, one for thee!'--'So be it!'--By that offering those two smote the fiends, the Rakshas, in the (four) quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by that offering smite the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters; and gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:13">5:2:4:13</a></font></span>13. Now what cake on eight potsherds there is for Agni, that is one of Agni's shares; and what barley pap there is for Varu<i>n</i>a--Varu<i>n</i>a being the same as Agni--that is Agni's second share; and what pap of gavedhukâ seed there is for Rudra--Rudra being the same as Agni--that is Agni's third share. And as to why it is prepared of gavedhukâ seed: that god surely is (the recipient) of refuse (remains of offering) <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and gavedhukâ grass is refuse,--hence it is prepared of gavedhukâ seed. And what mess of sour curds there is from a yoke-trained cow for Indra, that is the fourth share (being that) of Indra--turîya being the same as <i>k</i>aturtha (fourth)--hence the name Indraturîya. That same yoke-trained cow is the fee for this (offering); for by her shoulder she is of Agni's nature, since her shoulder is, as it were, fire-burnt; and in that, being a female, she improperly draws (the cart), that is her Varu<i>n</i>ic</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>nature; and in that she is a cow, she is of Rudra's nature <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and in that Indra's sour curds (come) from her, thereby she is of Indra's nature. Indeed that (cow) commands all that: therefore that same yoke-trained cow is the fee.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:14">5:2:4:14</a></font></span>14. Thereupon he performs the Apâmârgahoma; for by means of apâmârga plants (achyranthes aspera) the gods wiped away (apa-mar<i>g</i>) the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now by means of apâmârga plants wipe away the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters; and in like manner does he gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:15">5:2:4:15</a></font></span>15. He takes apâmârga grains in a dipping-spoon of either palâ<i>s</i>a (butea frondosa) or vikaṅkata (flacourtia sapida) wood. They take a firebrand from the Anvâhâryapa<i>k</i>ana (southern) fire; and proceed therewith eastward or northward; and there having made up a fire he offers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:16">5:2:4:16</a></font></span>16. He takes the firebrand with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 37; <i>Ri</i>k S. III, 24, 1), 'Encounter the arrays, Agni!'--arrays means battles: 'encounter the battles!' he thereby says;--'Repel the evil-wisher!'--the evil-wisher is the enemy: 'beat off the enemy!' he thereby says;--'Unconquerable, conquering the evil-doers!'--unconquerable he is indeed, by the Rakshas, the fiends; and conquering the evil-doers, for he conquers every evil:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>therefore he says, 'conquering the evil-doers;'--'Bestow glory upon the offerer of sacrifice!'--'bestowing blessing on the Sacrificer,' is what he thereby says.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:17">5:2:4:17</a></font></span>17. Thereupon making up the fire he offers with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 38), 'At the impulse of the God Savit<i>ri</i> I offer with the arms of the A<i>s</i>vins, with the hands of Pûshan, with the strength of the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u!' for the Upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>u <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">1</font></a> (cup of Soma) is the mouth (or opening) of the sacrifice: thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas, by the mouth of the sacrifice;--'Slain is the Rakshas, hail!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:18">5:2:4:18</a></font></span>18. If the dipping-spoon is of palâ<i>s</i>a wood,--the palâ<i>s</i>a being the Brahman--it is with the Brahman that he slays the fiends, the Rakshas; and if it is of vikaṅkata wood,--the vikaṅkata being the thunderbolt--it is with the thunderbolt that the slays the fiends, the Rakshas: 'For the slaughter of the Rakshas (I take) thee!' therewith he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:19">5:2:4:19</a></font></span>19. If he offers after going eastward, he throws the spoon towards the east; and if he offers after going northward, he throws the spoon towards the north, with, 'We have slain the Rakshas!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5:2:4:20">5:2:4:20</a></font></span>20. Thereupon they return (to the sacrificial ground) without looking back. Now by this (ceremony) also he may make for himself a counter-charm <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">2</font></a>. In whatever direction from there (his evil-wisher) is,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>looking back thither he offers; for the Apâmârga is of a backward effect: whosoever does anything to him there, him indeed he thereby pitches backward. Let him indicate the name of that one, saying, 'We have slain so and so! So and so is slain!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.</p>

During these intervals the ordinary Fortnightly sacrifices are to be performed from day to day in this way that either the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifice are performed on alternate days, or the former on each day of the bright fortnights, and the latter on each day of the dark fortnights. Thus, according to Â<i>s</i>v. Sr. IX, 3, 6; while Kâty. XV, 1, 18 allows only the latter mode. The final Seasonal offering, or <i>S</i>unâsîrya, which ordinarily is performed a twelvemonth after the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva, or on the full-moon of Phâlguna, is on the present occasion to be performed just a year after the opening sacrifice, or Pavitra (<a href="sbe4110.htm#page_42">p. 42</a>, note <a href="sbe4110.htm#fn_98">1</a>), i.e. on the first day of the bright fortnight of Phâlguna, being immediately followed by the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avâtîya.</p>

S., vol. ii, p. 93), however, prescribes a so-called Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>edhmîya, i.e. an oblation 'on five firebrands,' the fire being, as here, poked about so as to form separate heaps in the four quarters and in the centre.</p>
