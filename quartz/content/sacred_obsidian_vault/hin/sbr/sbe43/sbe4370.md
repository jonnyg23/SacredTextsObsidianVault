 <p>tortoise <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">1</font></a> with its head backward (westward), and the victims’ heads turned backward, thereby he is built looking backward; and when he, lays down the tortoise with its face downward, and the victims’ heads with their faces downward, and the bricks with their faces downward <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">2</font></a>, thereby he is built looking downward; and when he lays down the (gold) man with his face upward, and the two spoons (with their open bowls) turned upward, and the mortar turned upward, and the fire-pan turned upward, thereby he is built looking upward; and when he lays down the bricks whilst moving round (the altar) in every direction, thereby he is built (looking) in all directions.</p>

One of them said, 'The head (<i>s</i>iras) means excellence (<i>s</i>rî): he has pulled out his excellence, he will be deprived of his all!' and so indeed it happened to him.</p>

Upwards, indeed, he (Agni) is built up, to wit, (in the shape of) the grass-bunch, the clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man, the two spoons, the naturally-perforated one, the grass-brick, the Dviya<i>g</i>us, the two Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i>, the <a href="errata.htm#6">Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis</a>, the two seasonal bricks, the Ashâ<i>dh</i>â, and the tortoise; and that fire which is placed on the altar-pile, assuredly, is then most manifestly his (Agni's) head: let him therefore not pull out (the head).</p>
