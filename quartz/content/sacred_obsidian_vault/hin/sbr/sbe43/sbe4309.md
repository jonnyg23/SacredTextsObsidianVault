For at that time the gods said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, the wind: they put it into that (fire-altar), and in like manner does he (the priest) now put it therein.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:2">8:2:3:2</a></font></span>2. He lays down the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts,--wind, doubtless, is breath: it is wind (air) he thus bestows Upon him (Agni). On the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (they are placed); for the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> are these two (worlds): it is within these two (worlds) that he thus places the wind; whence there is wind within these two (worlds).</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> He places them on every side: he thus places wind on all sides, whence the wind is everywhere. [He places them so as] on every side to run in the same direction <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thus makes the wind everywhere (to blow) in the same direction, whence, having become united, it blows from all quarters in the same direction. He lays them down alongside of the regional (bricks) <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thereby places the wind in the regions, whence there is wind in all the regions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:3">8:2:3:3</a></font></span>3. And, again, as to why he lays down the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts;--it is that he thereby bestows vital airs on these creatures. He places them so as not to be separated from the Vai<i>s</i>vadevîs: he thereby bestows vital airs not separated from the creatures. [He lays them down with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 8], 'Preserve mine up-breathing! Preserve my down-breathing! Preserve my through-breathing! Make mine eye shine far and wide! Make mine ear resound!' He thereby bestows on them properly constituted vital airs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:4">8:2:3:4</a></font></span>4. He then lays down the Apasyâ (bricks). For the gods, at that time, spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, rain:</p>

 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>they put it into that (fire-altar) and in like manner does he now put it therein.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:5">8:2:3:5</a></font></span>5. He put on the Apasyâs; for rain is water (ap); it is rain he thereby puts into it (the altar; or into him, Agni). On the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (he places them), for, the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> being these two (worlds), it is on these two (worlds) that he thereby bestows rain, whence it rains therein. He places them on every side: he thus puts rain everywhere, whence it rains everywhere. [He places them] so as everywhere to run in the same direction <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thereby bestows rain (falling) everywhere in the same direction, whence the rain falls everywhere, and from all quarters, in the same direction. He places them alongside of those referring to the wind <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thereby puts rain into the wind, whence rain follows to whatever quarter the wind goes.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:6">8:2:3:6</a></font></span>6. And, again, as to why he lays down Apasyâs,--he thereby puts water into the vital airs. He places them so as not to be separated from the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts: he thus places the water so as not to be separate from the vital airs. Moreover, water is food: he thus introduces food not separated from (the channels of) the vital airs. [He lays them down with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 8], 'Make the waters swell! Quicken the plants! Bless thou the two-footed! Protect the four-footed! Draw thou rain from the sky!' He thereby puts water that is made fit, into those (vital airs).</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:7">8:2:3:7</a></font></span>7. He then lays down the <i>Kh</i>andasyâ <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">1</font></a> (bricks) for the gods, at that time, spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, cattle (or beasts): they put it therein, and, in like manner, does he now put it therein.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:8">8:2:3:8</a></font></span>8. He lays down the <i>Kh</i>andasyâs; for the metres (<i>kh</i>andas) are cattle: it is cattle he thus puts into it (or, bestows on him, Agni). On every side (he places them): he thereby places cattle (or beasts) everywhere, whence there are cattle everywhere. He places them alongside of the Apasyâs: he thus establishes the cattle on (or, near) water, whence cattle thrive when it rains.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:9">8:2:3:9</a></font></span>9. And, again, as to why he lays down <i>Kh</i>andasyâs. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was relaxed, the cattle, having become metres, went from him. Gâyatrî, having become a metre, overtook them by dint of her vigour; and as to how Gâyatrî overtook them, it is that this is the quickest (shortest) metre. And so Pra<i>g</i>âpati, in the form of that (Gâyatrî), by dint of his vigour, overtook those cattle.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:10">8:2:3:10</a></font></span>10. [He lays down four in front, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 9], 'The head is vigour,'--Pra<i>g</i>âpati, doubtless, is the head: it is he that became vigour;--'Pra<i>g</i>âpati the metre,'--Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed became a metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:11">8:2:3:11</a></font></span>11. 'The Kshatra is vigour,'--the Kshatra, doubtless, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, it is he that became vigour;--'the pleasure-giving metre,'--what is undefined</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>that is pleasure-giving; and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is undefined, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed became a metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:12">8:2:3:12</a></font></span>12. 'Support is vigour,'--the support, doubtless, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: it is he that became vigour;--'the over-lord the metre,'--the over-lord, doubtless, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati indeed became a metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:13">8:2:3:13</a></font></span>13. 'The All-worker is vigour,'--the All-worker, doubtless, is Pra<i>g</i>âpati: it is he that became vigour;--'the highest lord the metre,'--Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the highest lord, doubtless, is the waters, for they (the waters of heaven) are in the highest place: Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the highest lord, indeed became a metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:3:14">8:2:3:14</a></font></span>14. These then are four kinds of vigour, and four metres; this (makes) eight,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables: this, assuredly, is that same Gâyatrî in the form of which Pra<i>g</i>âpati then, by his vigour, overtook those cattle; whence they say of worn-out cattle that they are overtaken by vigour (or, age), and hence (the word) 'vigour' recurs with all (these bricks). And those cattle which went away from him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) are these fifteen other (formulas): the cattle are a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold: whence he who possesses cattle, drives off the evildoer, for the thunderbolt drives off the evildoer for him. And in whatever direction, therefore, the possessor of cattle goes, that he finds torn up by the thunderbolt.</p>

The five Apasyâ bricks are placed immediately to the right of the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts (looking towards the latter from the centre of the altar), so as to fill up the four remaining spaces between the four sets of bricks on the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i>.</p>
