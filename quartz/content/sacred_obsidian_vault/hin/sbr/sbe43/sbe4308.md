 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:1">8:2:2:1</a></font></span>1. He then lays down the Vai<i>s</i>vadevî (All-gods’ bricks). For this second layer is that one which the A<i>s</i>vins at that time laid down for them (the gods); and by laying it down they became everything here whatsoever there is here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:2">8:2:2:2</a></font></span>2. The gods spake, 'The A<i>s</i>vins have become everything here: think ye upon this as to how we also may share in it!' They said, 'Meditate ye (<i>k</i>it)!' whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, Seek ye a layer (<i>k</i>iti)! seek ye in what way we also may share in it!' whilst meditating, they saw these Vai<i>s</i>vadevî (All-gods’) bricks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:3">8:2:2:3</a></font></span>3. They said, 'The A<i>s</i>vins have become everything here: with the help of the A<i>s</i>vins let us lay down (bricks) along with the A<i>s</i>vins’ layer!' With the help of the A<i>s</i>vins they accordingly laid down (bricks) along with the A<i>s</i>vins’ layer, whence they call this the A<i>s</i>vins’ layer. Hence the end of these (bricks) is the same as that of the former ones; for they laid them down with the help of the A<i>s</i>vins along with the A<i>s</i>vins’ layer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:4">8:2:2:4</a></font></span>4. And, again, as to why he lays down the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> All-gods’ (bricks). These indeed are those same All-gods who saw this second layer, and who came nigh with that life-sap: it is them he thereby bestows, that is, all these creatures. He lays them down in the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i>; for the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> are these two (heaven and earth): within these two (worlds) he thus places creatures; whence there are creatures within these two (worlds). He places (bricks) on every side: he thus places creatures everywhere, whence there are creatures everywhere. He places them alongside of the regional ones <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thus places creatures in the regions (quarters); whence there are creatures in all the (four) quarters.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:5">8:2:2:5</a></font></span>5. And, again, as to why he lays down the All-gods’ (bricks). When Pra<i>g</i>âpati had become relaxed, all creatures went forth from the midst of him, from that birth-place of theirs. When that (central part) of his body had been restored, they entered him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:6">8:2:2:6</a></font></span>6. Now the Pra<i>g</i>âpati who become relaxed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and the creatures who went forth from the midst of him are these same All-gods’ bricks; and when he lays these down, he causes those creatures, which went forth from the midst of him, to enter him. In the range of the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> (he places the Vai<i>s</i>vadevî bricks), for the Reta<i>h</i>si<i>k</i> are the ribs, and the ribs</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>are the middle: he thus causes the creatures to enter him in the very middle. He places them on all sides: on all sides he thus causes the creatures to enter him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:7">8:2:2:7</a></font></span>7. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vai<i>s</i>vadevî (bricks). At that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pra<i>g</i>âpati desired, 'May I create creatures, may I be reproduced!' Having entered into union with the seasons, the waters, the vital airs, the year, and the A<i>s</i>vins, he produced these creatures; and in like manner does this Sacrificer, by entering into union with those deities, now produce these creatures. Hence with all (of these bricks, the word) sa<i>g</i>ush ('in union with') recurs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:8">8:2:2:8</a></font></span>8. [He lays down the Vai<i>s</i>vadevî bricks, with Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XIV, 7], 'In union with the seasons,'--he thereby produced the seasons, and having entered into union with the seasons he produced (creatures);--'in union with the ranges,'--the ranges, doubtless, are the waters, for by water everything is ranged (distributed or produced) here: having entered into union with the waters he produced (creatures);--'in union with the gods,'--he thereby produced the gods,--those who are called 'gods <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">1</font></a>;'--'in union with the life-sustaining gods,'--the life-sustaining gods, doubtless, are the vital airs, for by the vital airs everything living here is sustained; or, the life-sustaining gods are the metres, for by the metres (sacred writ) everything living is sustained here; having entered into union with the vital airs he produced creatures;--</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'for Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara,'--Agni Vai<i>s</i>vânara ('belonging to all men'), doubtless, is the year: having entered into union with the year he produced creatures;--'May the A<i>s</i>vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!'--having entered into union with the A<i>s</i>vins he produced creatures.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:2:9">8:2:2:9</a></font></span>9. 'In union with the Vasus,' he says on the right side: he thereby produced the Vasus;--'in union with the Rudras,' he says at the back: he thereby produced the Rudras;--'in union with the Âdityas,' he says on the left side: he thereby produced the Âdityas;--'in union with the All-gods,' he says upwards: he thereby produced the All-gods. These (bricks) have the same beginning and end, but are different in the middle: as to their having the same beginning and end, it is because having become united with the deities in front and behind, he produced creatures; and as to their being different in the middle, it is that each time he produced different creatures from within him.</p>

They were, moreover, placed in the second space (or at the distance of half a foot) from the two spines, see <a href="sbe4307.htm#page_23">p. 23</a>, note <a href="sbe4307.htm#fn_76">1</a>. The five Vai<i>s</i>vadevîs are then placed alongside of the Â<i>s</i>vinîs, so as to fill up the 'first spaces,' that is to say, to lie on the spines themselves; each of the two half-foot bricks laid down in the south being, as it were, halved by the spine.</p>
