 <p><font size="-1">THIS solemn and awful ceremony consists of 425 oblations to Rudra, the representative of the fearful aspects of life and nature, accompanied by appropriate formulas addressed to the various forms of the terrible god, and his associates, with a view to appeasing their wrath. These formulas make up a complete kâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>a (XVI) of the Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyi-sa<i>m</i>hitâ, and constitute a special Upanishad. Though only a few of the formulas are actually referred to in the text of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the different portions of which this dismal litany consists are otherwise alluded to, and for this reason, as well as on account of its intrinsic interest, as doubtless reflecting, to a considerable extent, the popular belief in demoniac agencies to which man is constantly exposed, a complete translation of the <i>S</i>atarudriya formulas is here given. For a German translation of the Taittirîya recension of the text, with the various readings of the Kâ<i>th</i>aka and Vâ<i>g</i>asaneyin versions, see A. Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 14 seqq.</font></p>  
 <p>I. 1. Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy wrath; and to thine arrow be reverence; and to both thine arms be reverence! 2. What auspicious form there is of thine, free from terror and boding of evil, with that most propitious form look down upon us, O mountain-dweller! 3. The shaft thou bearest in thy hand to hurl, O mountain-dweller, make it harmless, O protector of mountains, injure not man nor beast! 4. With auspicious speech we call upon thee, O mountain-dweller, that all these living beings of ours may</p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-1">be healthy and of good cheer! 5. May he plead for us as our intercessor, the first divine physician: crushing all serpents, turn thou aside all practices of witchcraft! 6. That tawny one, and the ruddy and the brown one, the auspicious--the Rudras that hover around him by thousands in the quarters: their wrath do we deprecate. 7. That one who glideth downwards (the sun) blood-red and blue-necked--the cowherds have seen him and the water-bearers (f. the clouds) have seen him--be he gracious unto us, when seen! 8. Reverence be to the blue-necked, thousand-eyed showerer; and what henchmen there are of his, to them do I render homage. 9. Loose thou the string from the ends of thy bow; and cast away the arrows in thy hand, O holy one! 10. Stringless be the bow of the coil-braided one, and arrowless his quiver! may his arrows be futile, axed empty his scabbard! 11. With that plague-repelling weapon in thy hand, with thy bow, protect us, O best of showerers, on all sides! 12. May the shaft of thy bow spare us on all sides, and far from us lay down that quiver of thine! 13. Unstringing the bow, and breaking off the points of thy shafts, be thou gracious and well-disposed unto us, O thousand-eyed lord of a hundred quivers! 14. Reverence be to thine unstrung weapon, the powerful one; and reverence be to thine arms and to thy bow! 15. Neither our full-grown, nor our little one, neither the virile, nor the unborn, neither our father strike thou, nor our mother: harm not our dear bodies, O Rudra! 16. Neither to our children, and our children's children, nor to our life, neither to our kine nor to our horses do thou injury! smite not our shining warriors: with offering we ever invoke thee, O Rudra!</font></p>

This whole Agni has now <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">1</font></a> been completed: he now is the deity Rudra. Upon him the gods bestowed that highest form, immortality.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:2">9:1:1:2</a></font></span>2. They spake, 'Let us gather together food for him: therewith we will appease him!' They gathered for him that food, the <i>S</i>ântadevatya <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and thereby appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased (<i>s</i>am) the god (deva), it is called <i>S</i>ântadevatya;--<i>S</i>ântadevatya, doubtless, is here called mystically '<i>S</i>atarudriya <a name="fr_263"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">3</font></a>,' for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this Sacrificer now bestow upon him that highest form, immortality. Flaming he there stands, longing for food. He gathers for him that food, the <i>S</i>ântadevatya, and thereby appeases him.</p>

He (Agni) grows when he is being built up: he grows for (the consumption) of every kind of food. And wild sesamum seeds represent both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the wild-growing: inasmuch as they are sesamum seeds they are a cultivated (kind of food), and inasmuch as they ripen on unploughed land they are wild-growing; he thus satisfies him with both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the wild-growing.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:5">9:1:1:5</a></font></span>5. He offers on (three) enclosing-stones:--these enclosing-stones are the (three) Agnis; and thus it is over Agni himself that these oblations of his become offered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:6">9:1:1:6</a></font></span>6. And as to why he performs the <i>S</i>atarudriya offering. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati had become disjointed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did not leave him, to wit, Manyu (wrath): extended he remained within. He (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) cried, and the tears of him that fell down settled on Manyu. He became the hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra. And the other drops that fell down, spread over these worlds in countless numbers, by thousands; and inasmuch as they originated from crying (rud), they were called Rudras (roarers). That hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra, with his bow strung, and his arrow fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being in quest of food. The gods were afraid of him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:7">9:1:1:7</a></font></span>7. They spake unto Pra<i>g</i>âpati 'We are afraid of this one, lest he should hurt us!' He spake, 'Gather food for him, and appease him therewith!' They gathered for him that food, the <i>S</i>atarudriya (offering), and thereby appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased (<i>s</i>am) the hundred-headed (<i>s</i>ata<i>s</i>îrsha) Rudra, it is called <i>S</i>ata<i>s</i>îrsharudra<i>s</i>amanîya,--and <i>s</i>ata<i>s</i>îrsharudra<i>s</i>amanîya, doubtless, is what</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>they mystically call <i>S</i>atarudriya, for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now gather for him that food, the <i>S</i>atarudriya, and appease him thereby.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:8">9:1:1:8</a></font></span>8. He offers gavedhukâ flour; for from the place where that deity lay disjointed, gavedhukâ plants (coix barbata) sprang forth: he thus gratifies him by his own portion, by his own life-sap.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:9">9:1:1:9</a></font></span>9. He offers by means of an arka-leaf; for that tree sprang from the resting-place of that god: he thus gratifies him by his own portion, by his own life-sap.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:10">9:1:1:10</a></font></span>10. He offers on (three) enclosing-stones <a name="fr_265"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">1</font></a>, for the enclosing-stones are the hair, and neither poison nor anything else injures one at the hair. He offers whilst standing on the left (north) side of Agni (the altar), with his face to the north; for in that region lies the house of that god <a name="fr_266"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">2</font></a>: it is thus in his own region that he gratifies him, in his own region he contents him with offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:11">9:1:1:11</a></font></span>11. The first Svâhâ ('hail') he utters on the knee-high one,---what is knee-high is, as it were, below, and below, as it were, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered this world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:12">9:1:1:12</a></font></span>12. Then on the navel-high one,--what is navel-high</p>

 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>is, as it were, the middle; and the middle, as it were, is the air-world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered the air-world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:13">9:1:1:13</a></font></span>13. Then on the one reaching up to the mouth,--what reaches up to the mouth is, as it were, above, and above, as it were, is yonder world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered yonder world. [He does so] with Svâhâ,--the Svâhâ is food: with food he thus gratifies them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:14">9:1:1:14</a></font></span>14. [He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 1], 'Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy wrath!' he thereby does reverence to that wrath which remained extended within him;--'And to thine arrow be reverence, and to both thine arms be reverence!' for it was by his arrow and his arms that he was inspiring fear.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:15">9:1:1:15</a></font></span>15. That god who became the hundred-headed (Rudra) is the chief (kshatra <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a>), and those others who originated from the drops are the peasants (clansmen): those peasants in the first place assigned to that chief this as his special share, to wit, this first chapter of formulas <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and gratified him thereby. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now assign this to him as his special fore-share, and gratify him thereby. Hence this (section) is addressed to a single deity, to Rudra; for it is him he thereby gratifies.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:16">9:1:1:16</a></font></span>16. There are here fourteen formulas,--thirteen months are a year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the fourteenth;</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is Agni: as great as Agni is as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him. 'Reverence! reverence!' he says;--reverence being sacrifice, it is by sacrifice, by reverence, that he thus reveres him. Therefore he must not mention any one unworthy of sacrifice, for it would be just as if he were to say to him, 'Sacrifice be to thee!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:17">9:1:1:17</a></font></span>17. He then makes offering to those forming pairs <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="#fn_268"><font size="1">1</font></a>: 'Reverence to so and so! reverence to so and so!' It is as if he were to say, 'Thou, N. N., and this one, do not ye two injure us!' for in no wise does a man who is known and appealed to <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_269"><font size="1">2</font></a> injure us.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:18">9:1:1:18</a></font></span>18. [Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 17], 'Reverence be to the golden-armed leader of hosts, and to the lord of regions be reverence!' for he (Rudra-Agni) is indeed the golden-armed <a name="fr_271"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">3</font></a> leader of hosts, and the lord of regions. And in that everything in this second chapter of formulas applies to one and the same deity, thereby he gratifies that (god Rudra), and makes the chief to have a share in the people (or the clan): hence whatever belongs to the people <a name="fr_272"></a><a href="#fn_271"><font size="1">4</font></a>, in that the chieftain has a share. And those (Rudras) that spread over these worlds, countless, by thousands <a name="fr_273"></a><a href="#fn_272"><font size="1">5</font></a>, they are the deities to whom he now offers.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:19">9:1:1:19</a></font></span>19. He thus makes offering to the tribes (of Rudras), for it was those tribes, those Rudras, that spread, and wheresoever they are there he thereby gratifies them. And thus, indeed, (he gratifies) those tribes of Rudras; and, men being after the</p>

 <p>manner of the gods, therefore also these tribes of men: tribe after tribe he thus gratifies them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:20">9:1:1:20</a></font></span>20. Now some of these (formulas) have 'reverence' on both sides, and others on one side only;--more terrible and more unappeased, indeed, are those (Rudras) that have 'reverence' on both sides: on both sides he thereby appeases them by sacrifice, by reverence.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:21">9:1:1:21</a></font></span>21. With (each set of) eighty (formulas) he utters the Svâhâ <a name="fr_274"></a><a href="#fn_273"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--on the first anuvâka, and on eighty, and on eighty; and the formulas which follow as far as the 'unstringing'-formulas (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 54-63),--eighties <a name="fr_275"></a><a href="#fn_274"><font size="1">2</font></a> mean food: by means of food he thus gratifies them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:22">9:1:1:22</a></font></span>22. He thus mutters these formulas (the last four of Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 46), 'Reverence be to you, the sparkling (hearts of the gods)!' for this is his favourite resort, either as a dear son or the heart: hence whenever he should be in fear of that god (Rudra), let him offer with those mystic utterances, for he draws nigh unto the favourite resort of that god, and so that god does not injure him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:23">9:1:1:23</a></font></span>23. 'Reverence be to you, the sparkling <a name="fr_276"></a><a href="#fn_275"><font size="1">3</font></a>,'</p>

 <p>for those (Rudras) produce (kar) everything here,--'hearts of the gods!'--Agni, Vâyu and Âditya (fire, wind and sun), these truly are the hearts of the gods;--'Reverence to the discriminating!'--for those (gods) discriminate everything here;--'Reverence to the destructive!'--for those (gods) destroy whom they wish to destroy;--'Reverence to the irremovable!'--for those (gods) are not (to be) removed from these worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:24">9:1:1:24</a></font></span>24. He then mutters those that follow (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVI, 47 seq.), 'Chaser! lord of the (Soma) plant!'--that (god) is indeed a repeller, for he chases away whom he wishes to chase away;--'lord of the plant'--that is, 'lord of the Soma-plant;'--'O blue-red cleaver <a name="fr_277"></a><a href="#fn_276"><font size="1">1</font></a>;'--these are names and forms of him: he thus gratifies him by calling him by his names;--'frighten and hurt not these people and these cattle! let none of us sicken!' as the text, so the sense.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:25">9:1:1:25</a></font></span>25. That god (Rudra) is the kshatra (ruling power; chieftainship or chief); and for that chief these peasants set apart this special fore-share, to wit, that first section (of formulas); and now he (the Sacrificer) sets apart for him that after-share, and thereby gratifies him; and hence this (section) also belongs to a single deity, to wit, to Rudra; for it is him he thereby gratifies.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:26">9:1:1:26</a></font></span>26. These are seven formulas,--of seven layers the fire-altar consists, and the year consists of seven months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him. These two kinds (of formulas) amount to twenty-one,--the twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first (make up) this amount.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:27">9:1:1:27</a></font></span>27. He then offers (the libations of the) 'unstringing'-formulas <a name="fr_278"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">1</font></a>. For at that time the gods, having gratified those (Rudras) by that food, unstrung their bows by means of these 'unstringing'-formulas; and in like manner this (Sacrificer), having gratified them by that food, now unstrings their bows by means of these 'unstringing'-formulas; for with an unstrung bow one injures no one.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:28">9:1:1:28</a></font></span>28. Here now he says 'at a thousand leagues,' for a thousand leagues is the farthest distance; and he thus unstrings their bows at what is the farthest distance.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:29">9:1:1:29</a></font></span>29. And, again, as to why he says 'at a thousand leagues,'--a thousand leagues means this Agni (fire-altar), for neither this way nor that way is there any other thing greater than he; and it is when he makes offering in the fire that he unstrings their bows at a thousand leagues.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:30">9:1:1:30</a></font></span>30. 'Countless thousands,--in this great sea,'--thus, wheresover they are, there he unstrings their bows.</p>  
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:31">9:1:1:31</a></font></span>31. There are ten of these 'unstringing'-offerings he makes,--the Virâ<i>g</i> consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ<i>g</i> (widely-shining or ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus unstrings their bows.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:32">9:1:1:32</a></font></span>32. He then offers the descending <a name="fr_279"></a><a href="#fn_278"><font size="1">1</font></a> (series of oblations). For then (in the preceding oblations) he ascends these worlds upwards from hence: this is, as it were, an ascent away from here. But this (earth) is a firm resting-place: the gods returned to this resting-place; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now return to this resting-place.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:33">9:1:1:33</a></font></span>33. And, again, as to why he descends. Then (in the preceding oblations) he goes after those (gods), gratifying (propitiating) them. From thence he now recovers his own self unto life; and so does he by that self of his attain all vital power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:34">9:1:1:34</a></font></span>34. And., again, as to why he descends. He then (in the preceding oblations) gratifies those Rudras from hence upwards; he now does so again from thence hitherwards.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:39">9:1:1:39</a></font></span>39. And as to why he says 'ten-ten,'--there are ten fingers in the joined hands <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thus makes reverence to them in each direction; and hence he who is frightened places his hands together;--'To them be reverence!'--he thus does reverence to them;--'May they be gracious unto us!'--they thus are gracious unto him;--'whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their jaws!'--thus he casts into their jaws</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a></p>  
 <p>whomsoever he hates, and whosoever hates him. He may say, 'So-and-so I cast into their jaws!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him. But let him take no notice of this (injunction), for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:40">9:1:1:40</a></font></span>40. In three turns he descends,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies them. With 'Svâhâ' (he makes offering), for the Svâhâ is food: with food he thus gratifies them. Thrice (in three turns) he ascends from hence upwards,--that makes six: the significance of this has been explained <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:41">9:1:1:41</a></font></span>41. And as to why he descends in three turns,--it is because he ascends in three turns: thus in as many turns as he ascends, in so many turns does he descend.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:42">9:1:1:42</a></font></span>42. He then throws that arka-leaf <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">2</font></a> into the pit; for it is therewith that he performs that sacrificial work sacred to Rudra, and that same (leaf) is inauspicious; he now puts it away, lest any one should tread on this inauspicious (leaf), and suffer injury thereby: hence (he throws it) into the pit. And, again, as to why (he throws it) into the pit,--the pit, doubtless, means the fire, and thus that fire consumes it. Now as to the (symbolic) correspondence.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:1:1:43">9:1:1:43</a></font></span>43. As to this they say, 'How does this <i>S</i>atarudriya of his attain to (conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year, to</p>

Well, this <i>S</i>atarudriya includes three hundred and sixty (formulas); and (other) thirty, and thirty-five. Now, as to the three hundred and sixty which there are, so many are there days in the year: thereby it obtains the days of the year. And as to the thirty (formulas) which there are, they are the thirty nights of the month: thereby it obtains the nights of the month: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And as to the thirty-five (formulas) there are, they are the thirteenth month <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">1</font></a>, (Agni's) self,--the body (consists of) thirty (limbs <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a>), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and off-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year. And in this way this <i>S</i>atarudriya of his attains to (conformity with) the year, Agni, and corresponds to the year, Agni. And, indeed, in the <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar as many bricks with formulas attached to them are placed in the middle, for these bricks are indeed the same as these different Agnis (invoked in the <i>S</i>atarudriya); and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the <i>S</i>atarudriya.</p>

And what eighties (of formulas) there are (in the <i>S</i>atarudriya), thereby indeed the (corresponding) eighties (of the Mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is recited. And what there is (in the <i>S</i>atarudriya) after the eighties that is for him the same as what there, in the Great Litany, is after the eighties <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">4</font></a>; and in this way this <i>S</i>atarudriya</p>

 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="sbe4330.htm#fr_286">168:1</a> For the mahad uktham, or Great Litany, recited on the Mahâvrata day, see <a href="sbe4324.htm#page_110">p. 110</a>, note <a href="sbe4324.htm#fn_202">3</a>. According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, however, this does not refer to the Mahad uktham, or Great Litany, itself, but to its Stotra, the Mahâvrata-sâman (cf. note on <a href="sbe4345.htm#10:1:1:5">X, 1, 1, 5</a>), by the chanting of which it is preceded, and which, like the Great Litany itself, is represented as being composed of the different parts of Agni-Pra<i>g</i>âpati's bird-shaped body. Now, that part of the chant which corresponds to the god's trunk (âtman) is the only part of this Stotra which is chanted in the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>astoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, which, indeed, is the characteristic Stoma of the Mahâvrata day, all other Stotras of that rite being chanted in that form. It is, however, doubtful to me whether it is not rather the opening part of the Great Litany itself representing the trunk that is here referred to, and which, indeed, consists of twenty-five verses; cf. F. Max Müller, Upanishads, I, p. 183. Besides, it has always to be borne in mind that the particular arrangement of the Great Litany which the authors of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a had before them, may have differed in some respects from those known to us.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="sbe4330.htm#fr_289">168:4</a> According to Sâya<i>n</i>a, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>avi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stotra, chanted after the Mahad uktham, is here referred to. See <a href="sbe4324.htm#page_111">p. 111</a>, note <a href="sbe4324.htm#fn_203">1</a>. Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it to refer to the prose-formulas at the end of the Sastra, which, he says, represent the mind (buddhi) of Pra<i>g</i>âpati.</p>
