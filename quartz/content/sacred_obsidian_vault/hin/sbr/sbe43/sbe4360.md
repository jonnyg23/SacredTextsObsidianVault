Now, the Ya<i>g</i>us, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst passing along he (Vâyu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and after him passing along everything is generated: this is why the Ya<i>g</i>us is no other than Vâyu.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:2">10:3:5:2</a></font></span>2. And the course <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">1</font></a> (<i>g</i>û<i>h</i>) is this space, to wit, this air <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">2</font></a>, for along this space it (the wind) courses; and the Ya<i>g</i>us is both the wind and the air--the 'yat' and the '<i>g</i>û<i>h</i>'--whence (the name) Ya<i>g</i>us. And the 'yat' (that which goes) is this (Adhvaiyu) <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">3</font></a>, for when he 'goes' on (performing), the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman carry that Ya<i>g</i>us established on the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> and Sâman. Hence the Adhvaryu performs his work with the very same Grahas (cups of Soma), (while) there are each time <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">4</font></a> different stotras (chants) and <i>s</i>astras (recitations): it is just as if, after driving with a first pair (of horses), one drives with a second pair.</p>

Now Agni is in front <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">1</font></a> (puras), for placing Agni in front (of them) these creatures attend upon him; and the sun is motion (<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a), for as soon as he rises everything here moves about. Such is the Ya<i>g</i>us with the preparatory performance (pura<i>s</i><i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">2</font></a>) as regards the deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:4">10:3:5:4</a></font></span>4. Now as regards the body. The Ya<i>g</i>us is the breath, for whilst moving (yat) it generates (vivifies) everything here, and along with the moving breath birth takes place here: hence the Ya<i>g</i>us is the breath.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:5">10:3:5:5</a></font></span>5. And this course (<i>g</i>û<i>h</i>) is space--this space which is inside the body--for along this space it (the breath) courses; and the Ya<i>g</i>us is both the breath and space,--the 'yat' and the '<i>g</i>û<i>h</i>': hence 'ya<i>g</i>us.' And the 'yat' (moving) is the breath, for the breath moves.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:6">10:3:5:6</a></font></span>6. The Ya<i>g</i>us, indeed, is food, for by food one is produced, and by food one moves. And food carries along that Ya<i>g</i>us established on food, whence even different food is introduced into the same (channel of the) breath.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:7">10:3:5:7</a></font></span>7. And the Mind is in front (puras), for the mind is the first of vital airs; and the eye is motion (<i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a), for it is in accordance with the eye that this</p>

 <p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a></p>  
 <p>body moves. Such is the Ya<i>g</i>us with the preparatory performance, firmly established both as regards the deity and the body; and, indeed, whosoever thus knows this Ya<i>g</i>us with the preparatory performance to be firmly established both as regards the deity and the body,--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:8">10:3:5:8</a></font></span>8. He, indeed, reaches successfully the end of the sacrifice, unscathed and uninjured: he who knows this becomes the first, the leader (pura-et<i>ri</i>), of his own people, an eater of food (i.e. prosperous), and a ruler.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:9">10:3:5:9</a></font></span>9. And if any one strives to become a rival <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">1</font></a> among his own people to one who knows this, he does not satisfy his dependants; but, indeed, only he satisfies his dependants, who is faithful <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">2</font></a> to that one and who, along with him, strives to support his dependants.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:10">10:3:5:10</a></font></span>10. And this is the greatest Brahman (n., mystic science), for than this there is no thing greater; and, he who knows this, being himself the greatest, becomes the highest among his own people.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:11">10:3:5:11</a></font></span>11. This Brahman has nothing before it and nothing after it <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and whosoever thus knows this Brahman to have nothing before it and nothing</p>

 <p>after it, than he there is no one higher among his equals in station; and ever higher will be the descendants that spring from him. Wherefore, if any one would be greater than he, let him reverentially approach the regions in front (to the eastward) of that one in this way, and he will do him no injury <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:12">10:3:5:12</a></font></span>12. But, indeed, the mystic import (upanishad) is the essence of this Ya<i>g</i>us; and thus, if, with ever so small a ya<i>g</i>us-formula, the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, that (essence) is equal to both the Stotra and the <i>S</i>astra, and comes up to both the Stotra and the <i>S</i>astra: hence, however small the essence (flavour) of food, it benefits (renders palatable) the whole food, and pervades the whole food.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:13">10:3:5:13</a></font></span>13. Satiation (contentment), doubtless, is the successful issue thereof (to wit, of food, and the Ya<i>g</i>us): hence when one is satiated by food he feels like one who has succeeded. And joy, the knowledge thereof (viz. of the essence, the mystic import), is its soul (self); and, assuredly, all the gods are of joyful soul; and this, the true knowledge, belongs to the gods alone,--and, indeed, whosoever knows this is not a man, but one of the gods.</p>

And Priyavrata Rauhi<i>n</i>âyana, knowing this (truth), once spake unto the blowing wind, 'Thy soul <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">1</font></a> is joy: blow thou either hither or thither!' and so, indeed, it now blows. Wherefore, if one desire to invoke any blessing from the gods, let him approach them with this, 'Your soul is joy,--my wish is such and such: let it be fulfilled unto me!' and whatever the wish he entertains, it will be fulfilled to him; for, assuredly, he who knows this attains this contentment, this successful issue, this joy, this soul.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:15">10:3:5:15</a></font></span>15. This Ya<i>g</i>us is silent <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">2</font></a>, indistinct; for the Ya<i>g</i>us is the breath, and the breath is of silent (secret) abode; and if any one were to say of that (Adhvaryu) who pronounces (the Ya<i>g</i>us) distinctly, 'He has uttered distinctly the indistinct deity: his breath shall fail him!' then that would, indeed, come to pass.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:3:5:16">10:3:5:16</a></font></span>16. And, assuredly, he who knows the indistinct (secret) manifestation of this (Ya<i>g</i>us) becomes manifest in fame and glory. Silently the Adhvaryu draws the cup of Soma with the (muttered) Ya<i>g</i>us, and, when drawn and deposited, it becomes manifest;--silently he builds the fire-altar with the Ya<i>g</i>us, and, when built and completed, it becomes manifest;--silently he takes out (material for) the oblation with the Ya<i>g</i>us, and, when cooked and ready (for offering), it becomes manifest: thus, whatever he performs silently, when performed and completed, it becomes manifest. And, assuredly, he who thus knows this secret manifestation of this</p>

 <p><a name="fn_647"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_657">336:1</a> '<i>G</i>û<i>h</i>' would rather seem to mean 'the urger, or speeder.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_648"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_658">336:2</a> 'Yad idam antariksham,' perhaps, with the double sense--'this air is the "yat (the going, moving thing)"'--made use of in the sequel. The construction, however, is not quite clear. Sâya<i>n</i>a explains: ayam evâkâ<i>s</i>o <i>g</i>ûr iti; <i>g</i>u iti sautro dhâtur gatyartha<i>h</i>; yad idam pratîyamânam antariksham asti tad eva <i>g</i>ûr iti; yad evo<i>k</i>yate--etam âkâ<i>s</i>am anulakshya <i>g</i>avate, vâyur ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati, vâyu<i>g</i>avamâdakara<i>n</i>a--tvâ<i>g</i> <i>g</i>ûr âkâ<i>s</i>a<i>h</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_649"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_659">336:3</a> Or, whence (the name) Ya<i>g</i>us, to wit, this (Adhvaryu).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_650"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_660">336:4</a> That is, in different Soma-sacrifices.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_651"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_661">337:1</a> Literally, apparently, 'The in-front is Agni.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_652"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_662">337:2</a> This term, literally, 'moving in front,' seems virtually to imply the entire manual work connected with the sacrifice, and which, along with the muttering of the Ya<i>g</i>us-formulas, forms the official duty of the Adhvaryu. It would thus include all the sacrificial performances prior to the muttering of a Ya<i>g</i>us, as the finishing or consecratory rite. For a somewhat similar discussion, see IV, 6, 7, 20. 21. The commentary introduces the present discussion thus: atha brâhma<i>n</i>âparanâmadheyasya pura<i>s</i><i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a<i>s</i>abdasya pûrvavan nirva<i>k</i>anapura<i>h</i>saram adhidaivam artham âha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_653"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_663">338:1</a> Or, tries to make opposition, as Sâya<i>n</i>a takes it--ya<i>h</i> purusha<i>h</i> sveshu madhye eva<i>m</i>vidam uktavidyâ<i>m</i> <i>g</i>ânâna<i>m</i> purusha<i>m</i> pratibubhûshati (!) prâtikûlyam â<i>k</i>aritum i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_654"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_664">338:2</a> Thus 'anu-bhû' is taken by the St. Petersb. Dict. ('to serve, be helpful to'), and by Sâya<i>n</i>a--'yas tv eva<i>m</i>vidam anukûlayet sa poshyân poshayitu<i>m</i> <i>s</i>aknoti.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_655"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_665">338:3</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a seems to take 'aparavat' in the sense of 'it has (only) something after it'--srash<i>t</i>avya<i>g</i>agadrûpâparavat--and the use of the word 'aparapurushâ<i>h</i> (descendants)' immediately after might indeed seem to favour that interpretation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_656"></a><a href="sbe4360.htm#fr_666">339:1</a> The MISS. of the commentary (I. O. 613. 149) are unfortunately not in a very satisfactory condition:--sa yo haitad iti, evam upâsîtety artha<i>h</i>; yadi veditu<i>h</i> sakâ<i>s</i>ât gyâyasa<i>h</i> purushasya sadbhâve tadâ svayam bâdhyo bhavatîty â<i>s</i>aṅkya tasmâd adhikapurushâd adhikam (a<i>kh</i>âdikât B) [vastu di<i>s</i>yopâsîtavyam (!) ity âha, yo<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>smâ<i>g</i> <i>g</i>yâyân iti; yadi asmâd upâsakât yo<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>dhika<i>h</i> syât tarhi tasmâd adhikât, om.

The commentary would thus seem to take it to mean that by showing reverence to something before, or higher than, his rival, he would turn aside his schemes.</p>
