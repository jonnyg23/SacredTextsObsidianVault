XIII, 56), 'This one behind, the all-embracer;'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder sun, for as soon as <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a> he rises, all this embracing space comes into existence. And because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards the back (west). The Sun, indeed, having become the eye, remained behind: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).</p>

'His, the all-embracer's child, the Eye,'--from out of that (all-embracing) form, the Sun, he fashioned the eye;--'the rains, the offspring of the eye,'--from out of the eye he fashioned the rainy season;--'the <i>G</i>agatî, the daughter of the rains,'--from out of the rainy season he fashioned the <i>G</i>agatî metre;--'from the <i>G</i>agatî the <i>Ri</i>ksama,'--from out of the <i>G</i>agatî metre he fashioned the <i>Ri</i>ksama hymn-tune <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--'from the <i>Ri</i>ksama</p>

'The <i>Ri</i>shi <i>G</i>amadagni,'--the <i>Ri</i>shi <i>G</i>amadagni, doubtless, is the eye: inasmuch as thereby the world of the living (<i>g</i>agat) sees and thinks, therefore the <i>Ri</i>shi <i>G</i>amadagni is the eye.--'By thee, taken by Pra<i>g</i>âpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pra<i>g</i>âpati,'--'I take the eye for my descendants,' therewith he introduced the eye from behind. Separately he lays down (these ten bricks): what separate desires there are in the eye those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes this eye one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut the eye asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this has been explained.</p>

XIII, 57), 'This, on the upper side, heaven,'--in the upper sphere, doubtless, are the regions (quarters); and as to why he speaks of them as being 'on the upper (left) side,' the regions, indeed,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>are above everything here. And as to why he says, 'heaven (or, the light),' the regions, indeed, are the heavenly world (or world of light). The regions, having become the ear, remained above: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:1:2:5">8:1:2:5</a></font></span>5. 'Its, heaven's, child, the Ear,'--from out of that form, the regions, he fashioned the ear;--'the autumn, the daughter of the ear,'--from out of the ear he fashioned the autumn season;--'Anush<i>t</i>ubh, the daughter of the autumn,'--from out of the autumn season he fashioned the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre;--'from the Anush<i>t</i>ubh the Ai<i>d</i>a,'--from out of the Anush<i>t</i>ubh metre he fashioned the Ai<i>d</i>a-sâman <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">1</font></a>;--'from the Ai<i>d</i>a the Manthin,'--from out of the Ai<i>d</i>a-sâman he fashioned the Manthin cup;--'from the Manthin the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a,'--from out of the Manthi-graha he fashioned the twenty-one-versed hymn-form;--'from the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a the Vairâ<i>g</i>a,'--from out of the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma he fashioned the Vairâ<i>g</i>a-p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a.</p>

'The <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra,'--the <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra ('all-friend'), doubtless, is the ear: because therewith one hears in every direction, and because there is a friend (mitra) to it on every side, therefore the ear is the <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vâmitra.--'By thee, taken by Pra<i>g</i>âpati,'--that is, 'by thee, erected by Pra<i>g</i>âpati;'--'I take the ear for my descendants,'</p>

'The <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vakarman,'--the <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vakarman ('the all-worker'), doubtless, is Speech, for by speech everything here is done: hence the <i>Ri</i>shi Vi<i>s</i>vakarman is speech:--'By thee, taken by Pra<i>g</i>âpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pra<i>g</i>âpati;'--'I take speech for my descendants,'--therewith he introduced speech from above.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:1:2:11">8:1:2:11</a></font></span>11. He lays them down by ten and ten,--of ten syllables consists the Virâ<i>g</i> (metre), and the Virâ<i>g</i> is all food: he thus bestows on him (Agni) the whole food. He puts them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows the whole food on him. And verily these same Virâ<i>g</i> (verses) sustain those vital airs, and inasmuch as they sustain (bh<i>ri</i>) the vital airs (prâ<i>n</i>a) they are called Prânabh<i>ri</i>ta<i>h</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_50"></a><a href="sbe4304.htm#fr_50">8:2</a> No explanation of this sâman has been found anywhere. Sâya<i>n</i>a, on the corresponding formula, Taitt. S. IV, 3, 4, 2 (where the term is spelt <i>ri</i>kshama), merely remarks that it is a kind of sâman.' The meaning of the term 'similar to a <i>ri</i><i>k</i>' would seem to indicate a hymn-tune involving little, or no, modification of the text chanted to it. At V, 4, 1, 5 it is the Vairûpa-sâman which (together with the <i>G</i>agatî, the Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma, the rainy season, and the Vi<i>s</i>) is in this way connected with the West. Now the textual parts of the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>anidhana<i>m</i> Vairûpam (Sâma-v., vol. v, pp. 387, 575-6), ordinarily used as a p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-sâman, show <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a> hardly any modifications on the original verses (Sâma-v., vol. ii, p. 278), even less so indeed than the simple Vairûpa-sâman (<a href="errata.htm#0">Sâma</a>-v., vol. i, p. 572), and possibly '<i>ri</i>ksama' (if it does not apply to a whole class of sâmans) may be another name for the Vairûpa (of which there are two other forms, Sâma-v., vol. i, pp. 425, 438) in its simplest form. The Vairûpa, in its p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a form, would in that case, indeed, have originated from the <i>Ri</i>ksama-sâman. It is true, however, that there is no special connection between the other P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-sâmans and the respective hymn-tune with which they are symbolically connected in the foregoing formulas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_51"></a><a href="sbe4304.htm#fr_51">10:1</a> Ai<i>d</i>a-sâmans are those sâmans which have the word 'i<i>d</i>â' for their nidhana, or chorus. Such sâmans are, e<i>g</i>. the Vairûpa (Sâma-v., vol. V, p. 387) and the Raurava (iii, 83), the latter of which forms the central sâman of the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna-stotra. What connection there can be between the Ai<i>d</i>a and the Vairâ<i>g</i>a-p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a (Sâma-v., vol. v, p. 391; cf. vol. i, pp. 814-5) it is not easy to see. In <i>S</i>at. Br. V, 4,i, 6 the North is connected with the Anush<i>t</i>ubh, the Vairâ<i>g</i>a-sâman, the Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a and the autumn.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="sbe4304.htm#fr_52">11:1</a> Or, perhaps, one thinks everything here.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="sbe4304.htm#fr_53">11:2</a> That is a sâman which has a special nidhana, or chorus, added at the end (or inserted in the middle) of it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_54"></a><a href="sbe4304.htm#fr_54">12:1</a> For these P<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a-sâmans see part iii, introd. pp. xx-xxi. In V, 4, I, 7 the upper region is symbolically connected with the Paṅkti metre, the <i>S</i>âkvara and Raivata-sâmans, the Tri<i>n</i>ava and Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stomas, and the winter and dewy seasons.</p>
