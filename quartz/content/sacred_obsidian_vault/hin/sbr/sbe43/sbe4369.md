Verily, this (brick-)built Fire-altar (Agni) is this (terrestrial) world:--the waters (of the encircling ocean) are its (circle of) enclosing-stones; the men its Ya<i>g</i>ushmatîs (bricks with special formulas); the cattle its Sûdadohas <a name="fr_764"></a><a href="#fn_752"><font size="1">1</font></a>; the plants and trees its earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks), its oblations and fire-logs <a name="fr_765"></a><a href="#fn_753"><font size="1">2</font></a>; Agni (the terrestrial fire) its Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â (space-filling brick);--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler <a name="fr_766"></a><a href="#fn_754"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler <a name="fr_767"></a><a href="#fn_755"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:2">10:5:4:2</a></font></span>2. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the air:--the function of heaven and earth (the horizon) is its (circle of) enclosing-stones, for it is beyond the air that heaven and earth meet, and that (junction) is the (circle of) enclosing-stones; the birds are its Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks, the rain its Sûdadohas, the rays</p>

 <p>of light its earth-fillings, oblations and fire-logs; Vâyu (the wind) is its space-filler; thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:3">10:5:4:3</a></font></span>3. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the sky:--the (heavenly) waters are its enclosing-stones, for even as a case <a name="fr_768"></a><a href="#fn_756"><font size="1">1</font></a> here is closed up so are these worlds (enclosed) within the waters; and the waters beyond these worlds are the enclosing-stones;--the gods are the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks; what food there is in that world is its Sûdadohas; the Nakshatras (lunar mansions) are the earth-fillings, the oblations and the fire-logs; and Âditya (the sun) is the space-filler;--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:4">10:5:4:4</a></font></span>4. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the sun:--the regions are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these <a name="fr_769"></a><a href="#fn_757"><font size="1">2</font></a>, because three hundred and sixty regions encircle the sun on all sides;--the rays are its Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these <a name="fr_770"></a><a href="#fn_758"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and three hundred and sixty rays of the sun; and in that he establishes the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatîs within the enclosing-stones thereby he establishes the rays in the regions. And what is between the regions and the rays, is its Sûdadohas; and what food there is in the regions and rays that is the earth-fillings, the oblations and</p>

 <p><a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a></p>  
 <p>the fire-logs; and that which is called both 'regions' and 'rays' is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:5">10:5:4:5</a></font></span>5. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Nakshatras:--for there are twenty-seven of these Nakshatras, and twenty-seven secondary stars accompany each Nakshatra,--this makes seven hundred and twenty <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_759"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and thirty-six in addition thereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_760"><font size="1">2</font></a> there are of these, they are the three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three hundred and sixty Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks; and what thirty-six there are in addition, they are the thirteenth (intercalary) month, the body (of the altar); the trunk <a name="fr_773"></a><a href="#fn_761"><font size="1">3</font></a> (consisting of) thirty, the feet of two, the (channels of the) vital airs of two <a name="fr_774"></a><a href="#fn_762"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and) thirty-sixth,--and as to there being two of these, it is because '<i>s</i>iras' (head) consists of two syllables;--and what (space) there is between (each) two</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:6">10:5:4:6</a></font></span>6. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B<i>ri</i>hatîs <a name="fr_775"></a><a href="#fn_763"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold one <a name="fr_776"></a><a href="#fn_764"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the B<i>ri</i>hatî (the great one)--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma (hymn-form) and the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:7">10:5:4:7</a></font></span>7. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Metres; for there are seven of these metres, increasing by four syllables <a name="fr_777"></a><a href="#fn_765"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and the triplets of these make seven hundred and twenty syllables, and thirty-six in addition thereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks there are of these, they are the three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three hundred and sixty Ya<i>g</i>ushmatîs; and what thirty-six there are in addition, they are the thirteenth month, and the body (of this altar),--the trunk (consisting of) thirty, the feet of two,</p>

 <p><a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 385</font></a></p>  
 <p>the vital airs of two, and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and) thirty-sixth; and as to there being two of these, it is because '<i>s</i>iras' consists of two syllables.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:8">10:5:4:8</a></font></span>8. Now the first ten syllables of this B<i>ri</i>hatî, consisting of thirty-six syllables, make an Ekapadâ <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_766"><font size="1">1</font></a> of ten syllables; and the (first) twenty make a Dvipadâ of twenty syllables; and the (first) thirty a Virâ<i>g</i> <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_767"><font size="1">2</font></a> of thirty syllables; and the (first) thirty-three a (Virâ<i>g</i>) of thirty-three syllables; and the (first) thirty-four a Svarâ<i>g</i> <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">3</font></a> of thirty-four syllables; and in that this fire-altar is built with all metres thereby it is an Ati<i>kh</i>andas <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and (so) indeed are all these bricks <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_770"><font size="1">5</font></a>. And the three syllables 'ish<i>t</i>akâ (brick)' are a Gâyatrî tripadâ, whence this Agni is Gâyatra; and the three syllables 'm<i>ri</i>d' (clay) and 'âpa<i>h</i>' (water) <a name="fr_783"></a><a href="#fn_771"><font size="1">6</font></a> also are a Gâyatrî tripadâ: thereby also he is Gâyatra.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:9">10:5:4:9</a></font></span>9. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B<i>ri</i>hatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the B<i>ri</i>hatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:10">10:5:4:10</a></font></span>10. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Year,--the nights are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because there are three hundred and sixty nights in the year; and the days are its Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three hundred and sixty days in the year; and those thirty-six bricks which are over <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_772"><font size="1">1</font></a> are the thirteenth month, the body (of the year and the altar), the half-months and months,--(there being) twenty-four half-months, and twelve months. And what there is between day and night that is the Sûdadohas; and what food there is in the days and nights is the earth-fillings, the oblations, and the fire-logs; and what is called 'days and nights' that constitutes the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.</p>  
 <p>

Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B<i>ri</i>hatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the B<i>ri</i>hatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:12">10:5:4:12</a></font></span>12. But, indeed, that Fire-altar also-is the body,--the bones are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because there are three hundred and sixty bones in man; the marrow parts are the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three hundred and sixty parts of marrow in man; and those thirty-six bricks which are over, are the thirteenth month, the trunk, the vital air (of the altar),--in his body there are thirty parts <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_773"><font size="1">1</font></a>, in his feet two, in his vital airs two, and in his head two,--as to there being two of these, it is because the head consists of two skull-bones. And that whereby these joints are held together is the Sûdadohas; and those three whereby this body is covered--to wit, hair, skin, and flesh--are the earth-fillings; what he drinks is the oblations, and what he eats the fire-logs; and what is called the 'body,' that is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:13">10:5:4:13</a></font></span>13. Now, these (amount to) twenty-one B<i>ri</i>hatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the B<i>ri</i>hatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the B<i>ri</i>hatî metre.</p>

But, indeed, that built Agni (the fire-altar) is all beings, all the gods; for all the gods, all beings are the waters <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_774"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and that built fire-altar is the same as those waters <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_775"><font size="1">2</font></a>;--the navigable streams (round the sun) are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because three hundred and sixty navigable streams encircle the sun on all sides; and the navigable streams, indeed, are also the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî bricks, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because three hundred and sixty navigable streams flow towards <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_776"><font size="1">3</font></a> the sun. And what is between (each) two navigable rivers is the Sûdadohas; and those thirty-six bricks which remain over are the same as that thirteenth month, and the body (of this altar, the waters <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">4</font></a>,) is the same as this gold man.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:15">10:5:4:15</a></font></span>15. His feet are that gold plate and lotus-leaf(that is) the waters and the sun's orb <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_778"><font size="1">5</font></a>--are his feet; his arms are the two spoons, and they are Indra and Agni; the two naturally-perforated (bricks) are this earth and the air; and the three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (all-light) bricks are these deities--Agni, Vâyu, and</p>

The welkin is the earth-fillings (between the layers of brick); the moon the oblations; the Nakshatras (lunar mansions) the fire-logs,--because the moon resides in (or with) the Nakshatra, therefore the oblation resides in the fire-wood: that <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">1</font></a>, indeed, is the food of the oblation, and its support; whence the oblation does not fail (na kshîyate), for that is its food and its support And what are called 'the gods' they are the space-filling (brick); for by (naming) the gods everything here is named.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:5:4:18">10:5:4:18</a></font></span>18 It is regarding this that it is said by the <i>Ri</i><i>k</i> (X, 12, 3), 'The All-gods have gone after this thy Ya<i>g</i>us,'--for all beings, all the gods, indeed, become the Ya<i>g</i>us here. Thus this whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.</p>
