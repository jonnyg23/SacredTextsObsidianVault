He lays down the Nâkasads (firmament-seated bricks): the firmament-seated ones, assuredly, are the gods. In this (layer) that whole fire-altar becomes completed, and therein these (bricks are) the firmament (nâka), the world of heaven: it is therein that the gods seated themselves; and inasmuch as the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven, the gods are the firmament-seated. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:2">8:6:1:2</a></font></span>2. And, again, why he lays down the Nâkasads. Now at that time the gods saw that firmament, the world of heaven, these Stomabhâgâs <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">1</font></a>. They spake,</p>

 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'Think ye upon this, how we may seat ourselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven!' They spake,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'Meditate ye! seek ye a layer!' whereby, indeed, they said, 'Seek ye this, how we may seat ourselves on this firmament, in the world of heaven!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:3">8:6:1:3</a></font></span>3. Whilst meditating, they saw these bricks, the Nâkasads, and placed them on (the altar): by means of them they seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and inasmuch as through them they seated themselves (sad) on that firmament (nâka), in the world of heaven, these are the Nâka-sad (bricks); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:4">8:6:1:4</a></font></span>4. He places them in the (four) quarters; for that firmament, the world of heaven, is the quarters: he thus establishes them in the world of heaven. On the range of the <i>Ri</i>tavyâs (he places them); for the <i>Ri</i>tavyâs (seasonal bricks) are the year, and the world of heaven is the year: it is in the world of heaven he thus establishes them. Within the Stomabhâgâs (he places them); for this is the firmament, the world of heaven: it is therein he thus establishes them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:5">8:6:1:5</a></font></span>5. In front he lays down one, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 10), 'Queen thou art, the Eastern region,' for a queen indeed the eastern region is;--'The divine Vasus are thine overlords <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">1</font></a>,' for the divine Vasus are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Agni is the repeller of shafts,' for Agni, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Triv<i>ri</i>t-Stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the threefold hymn(-form) this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Â<i>g</i>ya-<i>s</i>astra may support thee for steadiness’ sake <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_182"><font size="1">2</font></a>!' for by the Â<i>g</i>ya-<i>s</i>astra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Rathantara-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Rathantara-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the <i>Ri</i>shis, the first-born, magnify <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">3</font></a> thee among the gods!'--the <i>Ri</i>shis, the first-born, doubtless, are the vital airs <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">4</font></a>, for they are the first-born Brahman <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">5</font></a>;--'with the measure, the width of the sky!'--that is, 'as great as the sky is, so much in width may they broaden thee!'--</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'And he, the upholder, and the overlord,'--these two are speech and mind, for these two uphold everything here;--'may they all, of one mind, settle thee, and the Sacrificer, on the back of the firmament, in the world of heaven!' as the text, so its import.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:6">8:6:1:6</a></font></span>6. Then on the right (south) side (he lays down one <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">1</font></a>), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 11), 'Wide-ruling thou art, the southern region,' for wide-ruling indeed is that southern region;--'The divine Rudras are thine overlords,' for the divine Rudras are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Indra is the repeller of shafts,' for Indra, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ada<i>s</i>a-stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the fifteenfold hymn it is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Praüga-<i>s</i>astra may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Praüga-<i>s</i>astra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the B<i>ri</i>hat-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the <i>Ri</i>shis, the first-born, magnify thee among gods . . .!' the import of this (and the rest) has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:7">8:6:1:7</a></font></span>7. Then behind (he lays down one), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 12), 'All-ruling thou art, the western region,' for all-ruling indeed is that western region;--'The divine Âdityas are thine overlords,' for the divine Âdityas are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Varu<i>n</i>a is the repeller of shafts,' for Varu<i>n</i>a, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Saptada<i>s</i>a-stoma may uphold thee on</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>earth!' for by the seventeenfold hymn it is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Marutvatîya-<i>s</i>astra may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Marutvatîya-<i>s</i>astra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Vairûpa-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Vairûpa-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the <i>Ri</i>shis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:8">8:6:1:8</a></font></span>8. Then on the left (north) side (he lays down one), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 13), 'Self-ruling thou art, the northern region,' for self-ruling that northern region indeed is; 'The divine Maruts are thine overlords,' for the divine Maruts are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Soma is the repeller of shafts,' for Soma, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Ekavi<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the twenty-one-fold hymn this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Nishkevalya-<i>s</i>astra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Vairâ<i>g</i>a-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Vairâ<i>g</i>a-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the <i>Ri</i>shis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:9">8:6:1:9</a></font></span>9. Then in the middle (he lays down one <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">1</font></a>), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 14), 'The sovereign mistress thou art, the Great region!' for the sovereign mistress that great region indeed is;--'the All-gods are</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>thine overlords,' for the All-gods are indeed the overlords of that region;--'B<i>ri</i>haspati is the repeller of shafts,' for B<i>ri</i>haspati, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Tri<i>n</i>ava- and Trayastri<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-stomas may uphold thee on earth;'--for by the twenty-nine-fold and thirty-three-fold hymns this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Vai<i>s</i>vadeva- and Âgnimâruta-<i>s</i>astras may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Vai<i>s</i>vadeva- and Âgnimâruta-<i>s</i>astras it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'May the <i>Ri</i>shis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:10">8:6:1:10</a></font></span>10. Thus much, indeed, is the whole sacrifice, and the sacrifice is the self of the gods: it was after making the sacrifice their own self that the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after making the sacrifice his own self, seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:11">8:6:1:11</a></font></span>11. He then lays down the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>â ('five-knobbed') bricks; for the Nâkasads are (parts of) the sacrifice, and so indeed are the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs the sacrifice: the Nâkasads are these four sacrificial priests together with the Sacrificer as the fifth; and the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs are the Hotrâs <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Now the Hotrâs are additional (to the officiating staff, or to the Hot<i>ri</i>) and whatever is additional is an excrescence (<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>a); and hence, as they are five additional (bricks), they are (called) Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:12">8:6:1:12</a></font></span>12. And, again, as to why he lays down the Nâkasad-Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs;--it is for the sake of completeness; for the Nâkasads are the self, and the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs the mate, and this, the mate, doubtless, is one half of the self; for when one is with his mate <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">1</font></a>, then he is whole and complete.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:13">8:6:1:13</a></font></span>13. And, again, as to why he lays down the Nâkasad-Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs;--the Nâkasads are the self, and the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs are offspring (or subjects) <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Now progeny is something additional to the self, and whatever is additional is an excrescence; and hence, as they are five additional ones, they are (called) Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:14">8:6:1:14</a></font></span>14. And, again, as to why he lays down the Nâkasad-Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs;--the Nâkasads are the regions, and the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs, too, are the regions: what five regions there are on this side of yonder sun, they are the Nâkasads, and those which are on the other side are the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs. Now those regions which are on the other side of yonder sun are additional, and what is additional is an excrescence (<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>a): and hence, as they are five additional ones, they are called Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:15">8:6:1:15</a></font></span>15. And, again, as to why he lays down the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs. Now, at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>these worlds of theirs from above. They put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:16">8:6:1:16</a></font></span>16. He places one in front, with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 15), 'This one in front, the yellow-haired one,'--Agni, no doubt, is in front; and as 'to his saying of him as (being) 'in front,' it is because they take him out (of the Gârhapatya hearth) towards the front <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and attend upon him towards the front; and as to why he calls him yellow-haired, it is because Agni is, as it were, yellow;--'the sun-rayed one,' for Agni's rays are like those of the sun;--'and Rathag<i>ri</i>tsa and Rathau<i>g</i>as <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">2</font></a>, his commander and his chieftain,' the two spring-months are these two;--'and the nymphs Pu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ikasthalâ and Kratusthalâ <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">3</font></a>,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi; but army and battle these two are;--'mordacious beasts the shaft, manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they fight in army and battle, those mordacious beasts are the shaft; 'manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they slay one another, manslaughter is the missile;--'to them be homage!' it is to them he pays homage;--'be they gracious unto us!' they are indeed gracious to him;--'he whom we hate, and he who hates us,</p>

 <p>him we put into their jaws!' whomsoever he hates, and whoever hates him, him he puts into their jaws. 'N. N. I put into their jaws,' thus he may name him whom he hates, and thereafter he will not be there any more. Let him disregard this also, for indeed marked out of himself is he whom he who knows this hates.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:17">8:6:1:17</a></font></span>17. Then on the right (south) side (he places one), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 16), 'This one on the right, the all-worker,' the all-worker is this Vâyu (the wind) who blows here, for he makes everything here; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'on the right,' therefore it is in the south that he blows most;--'and Rathasvana (chariot-noise) and Rathe<i>k</i>itra (glorious on the chariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two summer-months;--'and the two nymphs, Menakâ and Saha<i>g</i>anyâ,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi; but these two are heaven and earth;--'Goblins the shaft, demons the missile;' for goblins indeed are here the shaft (weapon), and demons the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:18">8:6:1:18</a></font></span>18. Then behind (in the west, he lays down a brick), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 17), 'This one behind, the all-embracer,'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder sun; for as soon as he rises all this embracing space comes into existence; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards the back (west);--'and Rathaprota (fixed on the chariot) and Asamaratha (of matchless chariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two rainy months;--'and the nymphs Pramlo<i>k</i>antî (the setting one) and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Anumlo<i>k</i>antî (the rising one),'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi, but they are day and night, for these two set and rise; 'tigers the shaft, snakes the missile,' for indeed tigers are here the shaft, and snakes the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:19">8:6:1:19</a></font></span>19. Then on the left (north) side (he places one), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 17), 'This one on the left, of ever flowing blessings;' on the left is the sacrifice; and as to why he speaks of it as 'on the left,' it is because the sacrifice is performed from the left (north) side; and as to why he speaks of it as 'of ever-flowing blessings (sa<i>m</i>yadvasu),' they do indeed flow together (sa<i>m</i>yanti) to the sacrifice, thinking, 'this is a blessing;'--'and Târkshya and Arish<i>t</i>anemi, his commander and chieftain,' these are the two autumn-months; 'and the nymphs Vi<i>s</i>vâ<i>k</i>î (the all-inclined) and Gh<i>ri</i>tâ<i>k</i>î (the ghee-inclined),'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi, but they are the vedi (altar) and the offering-spoon, for the altar is all-inclined <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and the offering-spoon is ghee-inclined;--'water the shaft, wind the missile,'--water indeed is here the shaft, and wind the missile, for from this side it blows hot, and from that side cold;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:20">8:6:1:20</a></font></span>20. Then in the middle (he lays down one), with (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XV, 19), 'This one above, the boon-bestower <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' the one above, doubtless, is Par<i>g</i>anya (the rain-god); and when he speaks of him as (being)</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'above,' it is because Par<i>g</i>anya is indeed above; and when he calls him the boon-bestower, it is because from there the boon, rain, food for creatures, is bestowed hitherwards;--'and Sena<i>g</i>it (the conqueror of armies) and Sushena (leader of a fine army), his commander and chieftain,' these are the two winter-months;--'and the nymphs, Urva<i>s</i>î and Pûrva<i>s</i><i>k</i>itti,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi, but they are oblation and dakshi<i>n</i>â (priest's sacrificial fee);--'thunder the shaft, lightning the missile,' for indeed thunder is here the shaft, and lightning the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:21">8:6:1:21</a></font></span>21. These, then, are the shafts and missiles which the gods then put as protectors over these worlds, and as to offspring (or subjects <a name="fr_198"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">1</font></a>), they are the commander and chieftain; and as to the mates, they are those nymphs,--having thus become complete with offspring and with mates, the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having become complete with offspring and a mate, now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:22">8:6:1:22</a></font></span>22. Now, these are ten (Nâkasad-Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>â) bricks he lays down;--of ten, syllables the Virâ<i>g</i> consists, and this layer is virâ<i>g</i> (far-shining). There are, however, only five of them, for he lays them down by two and two. And, verily, they are prayers for prosperity to Agni (the fire-altar). He places them in the last layer, for this, the last, layer is the end of Agni: it is thus at the end that he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>pronounces the prayers for prosperity to Agni. There are five of them, for at the sacrifice there are five prayers for prosperity <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_198"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Between (each) two he throws loose soil, for these two bricks being fires, he does so fearing lest these two fires should blaze up together. And, moreover, loose soil means food: it is thus by means of food that he brings about concord between them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:6:1:23">8:6:1:23</a></font></span>23. Now; then, as to the order of proceeding. Having laid down (a brick) in front, he lays down those on the right, behind, on the left, and in the middle. Then the upper ones: having first laid down one in front, he lays down those on the right, on the left, in the middle, and behind. And, indeed, the world of heaven is entered from below, for the gods, having at that time, closed up these worlds on all sides, entered the world of heaven from below; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having closed up these worlds on all sides, enter the world of heaven from below.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_180"></a><a href="sbe4323.htm#fr_181">97:1</a> The central portion of the fifth layer is here characterised as symbolically representing the firmament, the blue canopy of heaven, and the region of bliss beyond it. The outer rim of this central structure is formed by a continuous ring of twenty-nine Stomabhâgâ (st) bricks representing, it would seem, the horizon on which the vault of heaven rests. There is some doubt as to the exact manner in which this ring of bricks is to be arranged. According to Kâty. <i>S</i>rautas. XVII, 11, 10, fifteen bricks are to he placed south (and fourteen north) of the anûka, or spine (running through the <a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a> centre from west to east). As regards the southern semicircle, the fifteen bricks are to be distributed in such a way that eight fall within the south-easterly, and seven into the south-westerly, quadrant. Some such arrangement as that adopted in the diagram below would seem to be what is intended. It will be seen that this arrangement includes two half-size bricks in the south-easterly</p>

 <p>quadrant, the one lying immediately south of the 'spine,' and the other immediately east of the 'cross-spine.' It is an awkward fact, however, that one of. the commentators on the Sûtra referred to, states that there are to be two half-foot bricks, (one) on each side of the spine--that is, as would seem, the 'cross-spine.' I cannot but think, however, that this must be a mistake, as otherwise it would seem to make the construction of a continuous ring impossible. Inside this ring, on the adjoining range (viz. the <i>Ri</i>tavyâ <a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a> range, being the fifth range from the centre, see the diagram of the first layer, <a href="sbe4305.htm#page_17">p. 17</a>), five Nâkasads (n) are placed on the spines, with the exception of the eastern one, which is to be placed in the second space north of the spine, that is to say, a foot from it (so as to leave space between it and the spine for the left Ritavyâ; cf. <a href="sbe4326.htm#8:7:1:11">VIII, 7, 1, 11</a>, with note). In the south two half-sized bricks are laid down instead of one full-sized one. All these five bricks are of half the usual thickness so as to allow five others, the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs (p), being placed upon them. Of the <i>kh</i>andasyâs, or bricks representing the metres, only three sets (of three bricks each, viz. a full-sized one flanked on either side by a half-sized one) fall within the circle formed by the stomabhâgâ-ring, viz. the trish<i>t</i>ubhs (t), <i>g</i>agatîs (<i>g</i>), and anush<i>t</i>ubhs (a). The remaining space in the centre is now filled up by the Gârhapatya hearth, consisting of eight bricks. Thereon is placed a second layer of eight bricks exactly corresponding to the first, and called Puna<i>s</i><i>k</i>iti. This pile (marked by hatching in the sketch) thus rises above the fifth layer by the full depth of a brick. He then lays down the two <i>Ri</i>tavyâs (<i>ri</i>t) just within the ring on the east side; and the Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis (v), representing the sun, immediately west of them. Having now filled up the available spaces of the layer with Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs, and scattered loose soil on it, he finally lays down two perforated bricks (marked in the sketch by cross-hatching), the Vikar<i>n</i>î and the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>â, so that the latter lies exactly in the centre, and the former immediately north of it, over the 'cross-spine.'</p>

Possibly, however, these five bricks, <a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a> being placed on the top of the Nâkasads, are themselves here represented as something additional.
