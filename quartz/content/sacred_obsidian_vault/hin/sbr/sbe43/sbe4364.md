 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:4:1">10:4:4:1</a></font></span>1. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was creating living beings, Death, that evil, overpowered him. He practised austerities for a thousand years, striving to leave evil behind him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:4:2">10:4:4:2</a></font></span>2. Whilst he was practising austerities, lights went upwards from those hair-pits <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">3</font></a> of his; and those lights are those stars: as many stars as there are, so many hair-pits there are; and as many hair-pits as there are, so many muhûrtas there are in a (sacrificial performance) of a thousand years.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:4:3">10:4:4:3</a></font></span>3. In the one-thousandth year, he cleansed himself all through; and he that cleansed all through is this wind which here cleanses by blowing; and that evil which he cleansed all through is this body.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> But what is man that he could secure for himself a (life) of a thousand years <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">1</font></a>? By knowledge, assuredly, he who knows secures for himself (the benefits of a performance) of a thousand years.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10:4:4:4">10:4:4:4</a></font></span>4. Let him look upon all these bricks as a thousandfold: let him look upon each enclosing-stone as charged with a thousand nights, each day-holder <a name="fr_715"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">2</font></a> with a thousand days, each half-moon-holder with a thousand half-moons, each month-holder with a thousand months, each season-holder with a thousand seasons, each muhûrta-holder <a name="fr_716"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">3</font></a> with a thousand muhûrtas, and the year with a thousand years. They who thus know this Agni as being endowed with a thousand, know his one-thousandth digit; but they who do not thus know him, do not even know a one-thousandth digit of him. And he alone who so knows this, or who performs this sacred work, obtains this whole and complete Pra<i>g</i>âpatean Agni whom Pra<i>g</i>âpati obtained. Wherefore let him who knows this by all means practise austerities <a name="fr_717"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">4</font></a>; for, indeed, when he who knows this practises austerities, even to (abstention from) sexual intercourse, every (part) of him will share in the world of heaven <a name="fr_718"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">5</font></a>.</p>

It is regarding this that it is said in the <i>Ri</i>k (I, 179, 3), 'Not in vain is the labour which the gods favour;' for, in truth, for him who knows there is no labouring in vain, and so, indeed, the gods favour this every (action) of his <a name="fr_719"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>
