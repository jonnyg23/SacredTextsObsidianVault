 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:1">9:4:3:1</a></font></span>1. Having now returned (to the hall), he, at the proper time, throws up the Dhish<i>n</i>yas <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">1</font></a> (fire-hearths)--these hearths are fires: he thus builds up fire-altars. They are the clansmen, and the built-up fire-altar is the chieftaincy: he thus sets up both the chieftaincy and the clan. The former (altar) he builds up first, then these (hearths): thus he sets up the clan after setting up the chieftaincy.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:2">9:4:3:2</a></font></span>2. That (fire-altar) is a single one: he thus makes the chieftaincy to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:3">9:4:3:3</a></font></span>3. That (fire-altar) consists of five layers, the others of a single layer: he thus endows the chieftain (or, ruler) pre-eminently with power, and makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan (or people). Upwards he builds that one: he thus builds the ruling power upward by (social) layers; sideways the others: he thus makes the clan obedient to the chieftain from below.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:4">9:4:3:4</a></font></span>4. That one he builds up both with the Ya<i>g</i>ushmatî (bricks laid down with a special formula), and with the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â (or space-filling ones, laid down with a common formula); the others with the space-filling one alone: he thus endows the chieftain pre-eminently with power, and makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan, and the clan less powerful than the chieftain.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:5">9:4:3:5</a></font></span>5. And when he builds up these (hearths) only with the space-filling one, the Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â being the nobility <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">1</font></a>--he thereby places the chieftain, as the eater, among the clan. He builds up (dhish<i>n</i>ya-hearths) both of the Soma-sacrifice <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and of the fire-altar; first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. Whatever Soma-hearth he (merely) throws up (at the Soma-sacrifice), that he (now) builds up. The Âgnîdhrîya he builds first, for that</p>

 <p>one he throws up first (at the Soma-sacrifice); (he does so) whilst sitting to the right (south) of it: the significance of this has been explained <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:6">9:4:3:6</a></font></span>6. On this (Âgnîdhrîya) he puts eight bricks,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. The variegated stone <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">2</font></a> is the ninth of them: there are nine vital airs--seven in the head and two downward ones--it is these he thus puts into it. The fire which is placed on the erected (hearth) is the tenth;--there are ten vital airs <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and the Âgnîdhra is the middle (between the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fires).: he thus puts the vital airs in the middle of it; for the vital airs, being in the middle of the body, move along it in this direction, and in that direction.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:7">9:4:3:7</a></font></span>7. Twenty-one he places on the Hotrîya (hearth), and there are twenty-one enclosing-stones <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">4</font></a>: the significance of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:8">9:4:3:8</a></font></span>8. Six (he places) on the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya,--these are the six seasons, the Fathers; for the seasons, the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Fathers <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">1</font></a>, indeed, heaped up (a rampart) round that (fire) from the south. This one lies to the south of those (other hearths) <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--this (Âgnîdhrîya) he lays down in this way (direction), and these (other hearths) in this way, and that one (the Fire-altar) in this way: he thereby makes the peasantry look towards the chieftain.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:9">9:4:3:9</a></font></span>9. He then encloses these (hearths) by enclosing-stones;--the enclosing-stones are the waters: it is thus by water that he surrounds them <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He merely lays them down all round, for those of the waters which flow in a hollow (channel) are the chieftain, and these stray waters are the clansmen; thus, when he encloses that (great fire-altar) by a dug-in (row of stones), he thereby adds power to power, and sure rounds (protects) power by power; and when he merely lays down those (enclosing-stones of the hearths) all round, he thereby adds clansman (or clan) to clansman, and surrounds (protects) clansman by clansman <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">4</font></a>. As many bricks with special formulas as</p>

 <p>there are (in each hearth) so many enclosing-stones there are (in each); for with that (fire-altar) there are as many enclosing-stones as there are such bricks in it <a name="fr_424"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">1</font></a>: he thus makes the clan obedient and subservient to the chief.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:10">9:4:3:10</a></font></span>10. He then scatters a layer of earth on (each of) these (hearths): the significance of this has been explained <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Silently <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">3</font></a> (he scatters it), for indistinct is the clan (or people). Then, after the cake-offering of the Agnîshomîya (animal sacrifice) <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">4</font></a>, he prepares the propitiatory oblations to the Regions;--that fire-altar is the regions: it is to them he offers these oblations, and thus by offering makes them a deity, for only that one is a deity to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom if is. not offered. There are five (such oblations), for there are five regions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:11">9:4:3:11</a></font></span>11. As to this they say,--Let him prepare this</p>

 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>offering (ish<i>t</i>i) so as to consist of material for ten oblations;--this (offering) is (performed) with all the stomas and all the p<i>ri</i>sh<i>th</i>a (sâmans) <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and there are (used in it) all the metres, all the regions, all the seasons--and this Agni (the fire-altar) is all this: he thus, by the (amount of) offering material (taken out for the ish<i>t</i>i), makes (Agni) the deity <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">2</font></a>; for only that one is the deity for whom the oblation is prepared, not one for whom it is not prepared. There are (in that case) ten (oblations),--the Virâ<i>g</i> (metre) consists of ten syllables, and Agni is virâ<i>g</i> (far-shining, or far-ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:12">9:4:3:12</a></font></span>12. But, indeed, he may also take out these oblations for the Divine Quickeners <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for these are the deities which become consecrated by this consecration ceremony by which he is now to be consecrated: it is them he thus gratifies, and gratified by offering they permit him (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and with their permission he is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as these deities are consecrated (quickened) by this consecration ceremony and quicken him for this consecration, they are (called) the Divine Quickeners.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:13">9:4:3:13</a></font></span>13. These (deities) come to have two. names, as he who is consecrated by the rite of consecration comes to have two names; for the very rite of consecration for which he is quickened, and by which he is consecrated (quickened), is his second name <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:14">9:4:3:14</a></font></span>14. There are eight (such deities),--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:4:3:15">9:4:3:15</a></font></span>15. As to this they say,--He ought not to offer (any of) these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive. Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the obtainment of special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatsoever oblation he offers after the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a (the cake-offering connected with the animal sacrifice), that is placed inside the animal victim itself as its sacrificial sap <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the fire-altar (or Agni<i>k</i>ayana), first those of the</p>

In a loud voice <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">1</font></a> the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a offering (is performed), in a low voice these (additional oblations), for they are an ish<i>t</i>i <a name="fr_434"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">2</font></a>. With the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship <a name="fr_435"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">3</font></a>' for they are an ish<i>t</i>i. There is the same Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t and the same i<i>d</i>â <a name="fr_436"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">4</font></a> (for these oblations). The (Devasû) deities have received offering, and the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a) has not yet been attended to <a name="fr_437"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">5</font></a>,--</p>

He then touches it (the fire-altar) with (the formula of) the preliminary consecration (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. IX, 39. 40), 'May Savit<i>ri</i> quicken thee for (powers of) quickening <a name="fr_438"></a><a href="sbe4342.htm#fn_431"><font size="1">1</font></a>! . . . This (man), O ye (people), is your king; Soma is the king of us Brâhma<i>n</i>as!'--he thereby excludes the Brâhma<i>n</i>as (from the power of the king) and makes them such as are not to be fed upon (by the king).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_406"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_413">241:1</a> A Soma-sacrifice being about to be performed on the newly erected fire-altar, now properly consecrated, all the necessary preparatory business and ceremonial enjoined for such a sacrifice have now to be gone through in the way detailed in part ii of this translation. The author here only alludes to those points in the Soma-ritual in regard to which the present performance offers any special feature either additional to, or modificatory of, the ordinary ceremonial. The construction of the Dhish<i>n</i>yas, or fire-hearths of the different priests (for which see part ii, p. 148, note 4), is one of these points.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_407"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_414">242:1</a> See <a href="sbe4327.htm#page_132">p. 132</a>, note <a href="sbe4327.htm#fn_235">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_408"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_415">242:2</a> There are eight dhish<i>n</i>ya-hearths at the Soma-sacrifice, two of which, the Âgnîdhrîya and Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya, were raised north and south of the cart-shed (havirdhâna), whilst the others (viz. those of the Hot<i>ri</i>, &amp;c.) were raised inside the Sadas along its eastern side. They were merely mounds of earth covered with sand, whilst the additional hearths (of the fire-altar) now to be erected are partly built of bricks.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_409"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_416">243:1</a> See VII, 1, 1, 21 seq., where the way in which the bricks of the Gârhapatya hearth are laid down is described in detail.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_410"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_417">243:2</a> When Agni was led forwards from the Gârhapatya to be installed on his newly built altar, as the Âhavanîya or offering fire, a variegated stone, meant to represent the sun, was deposited near the place (on the northern edge of the Vedi) where the Âgnîdhra shed and hearth would afterwards have to be erected; see <a href="sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:14">IX, 2, 3, 14</a>-<a href="sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:19">19</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_411"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_418">243:3</a> That is, including the central one, the outlet of which is the navel; cf. <a href="sbe4305.htm#8:1:3:10">VIII, 1, 3, 10</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_412"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_419">243:4</a> The numbers of bricks and enclosing-stones are the same as for the Gârhapatya hearth, for which (with their symbolic meaning) see VII, I, I, 32-35.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_413"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_420">244:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a refers to a passage in the Taittirîyaka, according to which a dying man is changed to whatever season he dies in, whence the six seasons are the representatives of all the deceased ancestors. Since the Fathers reside in the southern region it is from that quarter that, by laying down the bricks, they are supposed to raise a rampart for the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya fire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_414"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_421">244:2</a> Viz. on the southern edge of the Vedi, exactly south of the Âgnîdhrîya, whilst the other dhish<i>n</i>yas run in a line from north to south to the left of the space between the Âgnîdhrîya and Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya. The other hearths, together with the great fire-altar occupying the eastern part of the Vedi, would thus, as it were, face the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya in a semicircle. See the plan of the Sacrificial ground, part ii, p. 475.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_415"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_422">244:3</a> That is, as the earth is surrounded by the ocean (VII, 1, 1, 13), or a stronghold by a moat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_416"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_423">244:4</a> Viz. inasmuch as the fire-altar and the Âhavanîya fire on it, as <a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 245</font></a> well as the dug-in circle of enclosing-stones, are identified with the ruling power; whilst the dhish<i>n</i>yas as well as the circles of stones lying loosely around them represent the clan.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_417"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_424">245:1</a> This is not clear to me: whilst there are 395 such bricks with special formulas in the five layers of the great altar, it is enclosed by only 261 pari<i>s</i>rits; see <a href="sbe4330.htm#page_158">p. 158</a>, note <a href="sbe4330.htm#fn_264">1</a>. Besides there are no 'ya<i>g</i>ushmatî' bricks in these hearths, but only 'lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>âs'; one would therefore expect 'ish<i>t</i>akâs' (bricks) for 'ya<i>g</i>ushmatyas' the first time (cf. comm. on Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 7, 13). The Hot<i>ri</i>'s hearth contains twenty-one bricks, the Brâhma<i>n</i>â<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a<i>m</i>sin's eleven, the Mâr<i>g</i>âlîya six, and the others eight bricks; and in each case the common formula, 'Lokam p<i>ri</i><i>n</i>a, &amp;c,' (see <a href="sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:6">VIII, 7, 2, 6</a>), is pronounced once after every ten bricks, and after any odd bricks remaining over at the end. Cf. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XVIII, 6, 8 seq.</p>

In regard to this point there is, however, a difference of opinion between the Mâdhyandina and the Kâ<i>n</i>va schools, the latter using for the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a on this occasion, as well as on that of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, the same calls as those of the inserted ish<i>t</i>is; cf. Kâty. <i>S</i>r. XV, 4, 18-20.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_429"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_436">248:4</a> For the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, or oblation to Agni, 'the maker of good offering,' offered after the chief oblations, see I, 7, 3, 1 seq.; for the i<i>d</i>â-oblation (and invocation of I<i>d</i>â), I, 8, 1, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_430"></a><a href="sbe4341.htm#fr_437">248:5</a> The tentative meaning assigned to 'asamavahitam,' 'not in immediate connection with (the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t),' can scarcely be right. The clause seems simply to mean that the (pûrvâbhisheka) touching <a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a> of the altar is to take place, as in the case of the (preliminary) consecration at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, immediately after the oblations to the Divine Quickeners, and before the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t oblation of the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a has been performed. See V, 3, 3, 50, where a somewhat similar expression is used. One might have some doubt as to whether, both here and at the Râ<i>g</i>asûya, there is any Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t at all to these Devasû-havî<i>m</i>shi, or whether the statement, 'There is the same svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t and the same i<i>d</i>â,' applies not to them merely, but to them and the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a. If this latter alternative were the correct one, we should, however, expect that something had been said on this point in connection with the Devasû oblations of the Râ<i>g</i>asûya; and moreover the nature of the two oblations seems too different for such a partial identification, requiring as they do different 'praishas,' or calls, in the Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (viz. 'ya<i>g</i>a' the one, and 'preshya' the other); see also <a href="sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:40">IX, 5, 1, 40</a>, and note <a href="#fn_428">3</a>, <a href="#page_248">p. 248</a>; also Kâty. <i>S</i>r.
