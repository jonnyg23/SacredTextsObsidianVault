 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:1">9:5:1:1</a></font></span>1. Now, then, as to the taking of milk as fast-food: the initiated should take milk for his fast-food. Once upon a time the nectar of immortality departed from the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:2">9:5:1:2</a></font></span>2. They said, 'Let us seek for it here by toil and penance!' They sought for it by toil and penance. Having become initiated, they were living on fast-milk, for penance it is when, after becoming initiated, one lives on fast-milk. They heard the sound of it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:3">9:5:1:3</a></font></span>3. They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!' They resorted to three teats: they saw it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:4">9:5:1:4</a></font></span>4. They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!' They resorted to two teats: they saw it still nearer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:5">9:5:1:5</a></font></span>5. They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!' They resorted to one teat: it came nigh unto them, but they could not lay hold of it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:6">9:5:1:6</a></font></span>6. They said, 'It has indeed come nigh unto us, but we cannot lay hold of it: let us undergo the whole (practice of) penance!' On the day of preparation they underwent entire abstention from food; for the whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:7">9:5:1:7</a></font></span>7. On the morrow, having laid hold of it and pressed it (the Soma), they offered (of it) in the fire,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>and thereby bestowed immortality upon Agni. And he, Agni (the fire-altar), indeed, is the body of all the gods; and hence, when they bestowed immortality on Agni (the fire-altar), they bestowed immortality on their own selves, and thereby the gods became immortal.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:8">9:5:1:8</a></font></span>8. Now that same nectar of immortality is Soma. And even to this day the Sacrificer seeks for it by toil and penance; having become initiated he lives on fast-milk; for penance it is when, after being initiated, one lives on fast-milk; he hears the sound of it, saying, 'On such and such a day the buying (will take place <a name="fr_455"></a><a href="#fn_448"><font size="1">1</font></a>)!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:9">9:5:1:9</a></font></span>9. He resorts to three teats (of the cow): he sees it. He resorts to two teats: he sees it nearer by. He resorts to one teat: it comes nigh to him, but he cannot lay hold of it. He undergoes entire abstinence from food; for the whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:10">9:5:1:10</a></font></span>10. And, on the morrow, having laid hold of it, and pressed it, he offers (of it) in the fire, and thereby bestows immortality on Agni. He then drinks (of it), and thereby bestows immortality on his own self, and becomes immortal; for this, assuredly, is immortality to man when he attains the whole (perfect) life: and so, in truth, he attains the whole life by this self of his.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:11">9:5:1:11</a></font></span>11. When he has offered in the fire, he drinks (Soma); for that (fire-altar) is his divine body, and this (Sacrificer's own body) is his human one; and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a></p>  
 <p>the gods were first, and then men: therefore he drinks (Soma), after offering in the fire.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:12">9:5:1:12</a></font></span>12. Now, then, the discussion of the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us (oblations): The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, entered upon their father Pra<i>g</i>âpati's inheritance, to wit, speech--truth and untruth, both truth and untruth: they, both of them, spake the truth, and they both spake untruth; and, indeed, speaking alike, they were alike.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:13">9:5:1:13</a></font></span>13. The gods relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth, and the Asuras relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:14">9:5:1:14</a></font></span>14. The truth which was in the Asuras beheld this, and said, 'Verily, the gods have relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth: well, then, I will go thither!' Thus it went over to the gods.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:15">9:5:1:15</a></font></span>15. And the untruth which was in the gods beheld this, and said, 'Verily, the Asuras have relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth: well, then, I will go thither!' Thus it went over to the Asuras.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:16">9:5:1:16</a></font></span>16. The gods spake nothing but truth, and the Asuras nothing but untruth. And the gods, speaking the truth diligently, were very contemptible, and very poor: whence he who speaks the truth diligently, becomes indeed very contemptible, and very poor; but in the end he assuredly prospers, for the gods indeed prospered.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:17">9:5:1:17</a></font></span>17. And the Asuras, speaking untruth diligently, throve even as salt soil <a name="fr_456"></a><a href="#fn_449"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and were very prosperous: whence he who speaks untruth diligently, thrives indeed, even as salt soil, and becomes very prosperous;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p>but in the end he assuredly comes to naught, for the Asuras indeed came to naught.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:18">9:5:1:18</a></font></span>18. Now that same truth, indeed, is this threefold lore <a name="fr_457"></a><a href="#fn_450"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The gods said, 'Now that we have made up the sacrifice, let us spread out <a name="fr_458"></a><a href="#fn_451"><font size="1">2</font></a> this truth!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:19">9:5:1:19</a></font></span>19. They prepared the Initiation-offering. But the Asuras became aware of it, and said, 'Having made up the sacrifice, the gods are now spreading out that truth: come, let us fetch hither what was ours!' The Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us of that (offering) was not yet performed, when they arrived: whence people offer no Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us <a name="fr_459"></a><a href="#fn_452"><font size="1">3</font></a> for that sacrifice. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else <a name="fr_460"></a><a href="#fn_453"><font size="1">4</font></a>. They (the Asuras) went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:20">9:5:1:20</a></font></span>20. When they had gone away, they (the gods) prepared the Opening-offering. But the Asuras</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p>became aware of this also. The <i>S</i>amyos (formula) of that (offering) had been pronounced, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the <i>S</i>amyos <a name="fr_461"></a><a href="#fn_454"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:21">9:5:1:21</a></font></span>21. When they had gone away, they (the gods), having bought and driven about the king (Soma), prepared the guest-offering for him. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The I<i>d</i>â of that (offering) had been invoked, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the I<i>d</i>â <a name="fr_462"></a><a href="#fn_455"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:22">9:5:1:22</a></font></span>22. When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed) the Upasads <a name="fr_463"></a><a href="#fn_456"><font size="1">3</font></a>. When they had recited three kindling-verses, and no more, they made offering to the deities, but laid out <a name="fr_464"></a><a href="#fn_457"><font size="1">4</font></a> no fore-offerings and no after-offerings on either side of the sacrifice, for they were in too great haste at that time; whence at the Upasads, when he has recited three kindling-verses, and no more, he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a></p>  
 <p>makes offering to the deities, but lays out no fore-offerings and no after-offerings on either side of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:23">9:5:1:23</a></font></span>23. On the day of preparation they slaughtered the Agnîshomîya victim. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us oblations of this (offering) had not yet been offered, when they arrived; whence people offer no Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us for this animal(-offering). The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:24">9:5:1:24</a></font></span>24. On the next morning after they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed) the morning-service (of the Soma-sacrifice). But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the morning-service had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:25">9:5:1:25</a></font></span>25. When they had gone, they (the gods) spread out the midday-service. But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the midday-service had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:26">9:5:1:26</a></font></span>26. When they had gone, (the gods) went on with the animal-offering of the Soma-sacrifice <a name="fr_465"></a><a href="#fn_458"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much of this animal-offering as is done (at the evening-service) had been done, when they arrived. The gods, espying them, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:27">9:5:1:27</a></font></span>27. When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread the evening-service and completed it; and by completing it they obtained that whole truth. Then the Asuras went down <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_459"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Then the gods prevailed, and the Asuras came to naught. And, indeed, he who knows this, himself prevails, and his spiteful enemy comes to naught.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:28">9:5:1:28</a></font></span>28. The gods said, 'Those sacrifices of ours which are half-completed, and leaving behind which we went off <a name="fr_467"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">2</font></a>,--think ye upon this, how we may complete them!' They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye how we may complete these sacrifices!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:29">9:5:1:29</a></font></span>29. Whilst meditating, they saw these Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us (oblations), and offered them, and thereby completed those sacrifices; and inasmuch as thereby they completed (sa<i>m</i>sthâpaya) them, they are 'sa<i>m</i>sthitaya<i>g</i>us'; and inasmuch as thereby they sacrificed completely (sa<i>m</i>-ya<i>g</i> <a name="fr_468"></a><a href="#fn_461"><font size="1">3</font></a>), they are 'samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:30">9:5:1:30</a></font></span>30. Now there are nine such (incomplete) sacrifices,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p>and there are nine samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations <a name="fr_469"></a><a href="#fn_462"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and by offering these, he completes those sacrifices. He offers both kinds, those of the Soma-sacrifice, and those of the Agni(-<i>k</i>ayana),--first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:31">9:5:1:31</a></font></span>31. Two he offers of the fire-altar,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus completes the sacrifice. [He offers them, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 56, 57], 'Sacrifice hath been offered, up by the Bh<i>ri</i>gus . . .;'--'May Agni who hath received sacrifice and oblation speed our offered meat!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:32">9:5:1:32</a></font></span>32. These two amount to eleven,--the Trish<i>t</i>ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish<i>t</i>ubh means strength: it is strength he thus imparts to the Sacrificer.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:33">9:5:1:33</a></font></span>33. And, again, as to why there are eleven,--the Trish<i>t</i>ubh consists of eleven syllables, and Indra is of trish<i>t</i>ubh nature, Indra is the self (soul) of the sacrifice, Indra is the deity <a name="fr_470"></a><a href="#fn_463"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thus finally establishes the sacrifice in him who is the self, the deity of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:34">9:5:1:34</a></font></span>34. Having performed the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations, they betake themselves to the expiatory bath (avabh<i>ri</i>tha <a name="fr_471"></a><a href="#fn_464"><font size="1">3</font></a>). Having come out from the bath,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>and performed the Udayanîya (concluding oblation) <a name="fr_472"></a><a href="#fn_465"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he, after the animal cake of the offering of the barren cow <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_466"><font size="1">2</font></a>, prepares oblations for the goddesses.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:35">9:5:1:35</a></font></span>35. For now Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having gained his end, thought himself quite perfect. Establishing himself in the quarters he went on ordering (or creating) and disposing everything here; and inasmuch as he went on ordering and disposing, he is the Orderer. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, establishing himself in the quarters, order and dispose everything here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:36">9:5:1:36</a></font></span>36. And, again, as to why he prepares these oblations. This Agni (the fire-altar) is the quarters (regions), and these he lays down beforehand (in the shape of) the bunch of Darbha grass <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_467"><font size="1">3</font></a> and the clod-bricks <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_468"><font size="1">4</font></a>; the Prâ<i>n</i>abh<i>ri</i>ts <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_469"><font size="1">5</font></a> in the first layer, the whole of the second, the whole of the third, and the whole of the fourth (layers <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_470"><font size="1">6</font></a>); and of the fifth</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p>layer the Asapatnâs, Nâkasads and Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>k</i>û<i>d</i>âs <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_471"><font size="1">1</font></a>,--these kept going out upwards <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">2</font></a> (from Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the altar). Pra<i>g</i>âpati was afraid of them, thinking, 'Whilst moving away, these will go beyond this universe.' Having become the Orderer, he went round them and established himself in them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:37">9:5:1:37</a></font></span>37. Now the same as that Orderer is yonder sun; and that which was the farthest gone of the regions is that in which that (sun) shines firmly established.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:38">9:5:1:38</a></font></span>38. And the same as that Orderer is this cake to the Orderer on twelve potsherds. On twelve potsherds (it is),--the year is (of) twelve months, Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the year, and Pra<i>g</i>âpati is the Orderer. And that one which was the farthest gone of the regions is the same as these previous oblations,--a pap to Anumati, a pap to Râkâ, a pap to Sinîvalî, and a pap to Kuhû <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">3</font></a>: when he prepares these oblations, he thereby establishes him (Pra<i>g</i>âpati) in that which was the farthest gone of the regions. That (cake) he offers whole, for the completeness of that (Pra<i>g</i>âpati).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:39">9:5:1:39</a></font></span>39. These are goddesses, for they are the regions,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a></p>  
 <p>the regions are the metres, and the metres are deities; and that Ka is Pra<i>g</i>âpati; and inasmuch as they are goddesses (devî) and Ka, they are 'devikâ<i>h</i> <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' There are five of them, for there are five regions.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:40">9:5:1:40</a></font></span>40. As to this they say, 'He should not offer these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive.' Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the fulfilment) of (special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatever oblation is offered after the cake of the animal-offering that is placed inside the victim itself as its sacrificial sap. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the Agni(-<i>k</i>ayana), to wit, first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. The cake-offering of the animal sacrifice is (performed) in a loud voice, and these (five oblations) in a low voice, for they are an ish<i>t</i>i <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">2</font></a>. With the Pa<i>s</i>upuro<i>d</i>â<i>s</i>a he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship!' for they are an ish<i>t</i>i <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">3</font></a>. There is the same Svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t, and the same I<i>d</i>â <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:41">9:5:1:41</a></font></span>41. Of that same animal-offering (of the barren cow) they perform the Samish<i>t</i>aya<i>g</i>us-oblations; they enter the expiatory bath with the heart-spit <a name="fr_485"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">5</font></a>;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>  
 <p>for this animal-offering is the end. Having proceeded with the heart-spit;--</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:42">9:5:1:42</a></font></span>42. And having returned (to the fire-altar), he performs the oblations to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman;--This Agni(-<i>k</i>ayana) indeed (includes) all sacrificial rites (vi<i>s</i>vâni karmâ<i>n</i>i); and all these its rites have been performed in this (agni<i>k</i>ayana): he now gratifies them, and makes them a deity by means of an offering of sacrificial food; for only that one is a deity, for whom an oblation is prepared, but not one for whom it is not (prepared). Moreover, this Agni is Vi<i>s</i>vakarman (the all-worker): it is him he thereby gratifies.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:43">9:5:1:43</a></font></span>43. And, again, as to why he offers the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations) <a name="fr_486"></a><a href="#fn_479"><font size="1">1</font></a>. For the fire-altar there is both a beginning and an end: the Sâvitra <a name="fr_487"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">2</font></a> (formulas) are the beginning, and the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations) the end. Were he to offer only those to Savit<i>ri</i>, and not those to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, it would be as if he made only a beginning and no end; and were he to offer only those to Vi<i>s</i>vakarman, and not those to Savit<i>ri</i>, it would be as if he made only an end and no beginning. He offers both of them, and thus makes both a beginning and an end.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:44">9:5:1:44</a></font></span>44. There are eight of those (Sâvitra), and so (there are eight of) these: thus he makes the end</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a></p>  
 <p>(the same) as the beginning. The Svâhâ-call is the ninth of those <a name="fr_488"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. The oblation (âhuti) is the tenth of those <a name="fr_489"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. On that occasion he offers the oblation continuously so as not to stop the seed, the sacrifice there being seed;--on this occasion (he offers) with the dipping-spoon at the Svâhâ-call, for manifest is the seed when it is born.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:45">9:5:1:45</a></font></span>45. [He offers, with, Vâ<i>g</i>. S.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:51">9:5:1:51</a></font></span>51. Eight Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations) he offers,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:52">9:5:1:52</a></font></span>52. When he has performed the Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a (oblations), he gives a name <a name="fr_495"></a><a href="#fn_488"><font size="1">1</font></a> (to the fire of the altar); for when any one has been born sound and safe, they give a name to him, and now this (Agni) has indeed been born sound and safe.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:53">9:5:1:53</a></font></span>53. Having given a name to him, he reverently approaches him; for this (Sacrificer) builds him with his (own) whole self, and were he not to give utterance now to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) would now take away his (the Sacrificer's) self; but when he now gives utterance to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) does not take away his self. [He approaches the fire] with the Anush<i>t</i>ubh verse (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. XVIII, 67), 'What fires of the five races of men there are upon this earth,--thou art the chiefest of them: quicken us unto life!'--the Anush<i>t</i>ubh, doubtless, is speech, and all the metres are speech <a name="fr_496"></a><a href="#fn_489"><font size="1">2</font></a>: he thus makes amends to him (Agni) by all the metres. Having stood by the fire, and lifted <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_490"><font size="1">3</font></a> it, and churned it out, he offers the completing oblation <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_491"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:54">9:5:1:54</a></font></span>54. He then offers a dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_492"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Now he who performs this (Agni-<i>k</i>ayana) rite comes to be with the gods; and these two, Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, are a divine pair. Now, were he to have intercourse with a human woman without having offered this (oblation), it would be a descent, as if one who is divine would become human; but when he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a, he thereby approaches a divine mate <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_493"><font size="1">2</font></a>: having offered it, he may freely have intercourse in a befitting way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:55">9:5:1:55</a></font></span>55. And, again, as to why he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a. When Pra<i>g</i>âpati was released, the seed fell from him. When the gods restored him, they, by means of this dish of clotted curds, put seed into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put seed into him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:56">9:5:1:56</a></font></span>56. Now that Pra<i>g</i>âpati who became released is this very fire-altar which is here being built; and the seed which fell from him is this dish of clotted curds of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a; for Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a are the in-breathing and up-breathing, and the in-breathing and up-breathing fashion the infused seed. A dish of clotted curds it is, because seed is milk; and sacrifice it is, because sacrifice is the seed of sacrifice. In a low voice it is (offered), for silently seed is shed. At the end (of the sacrifice) it is (offered), for from the end seed is introduced.</p>

They proceed with the whey <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_494"><font size="1">1</font></a> of that (dish of clotted curds). At this (oblation of whey) he gives a dakshi<i>n</i>â (sacrificial gift): 'Let him give a pair of hornless he-goats,' so (they say);--'Only by assignment, I think <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_495"><font size="1">2</font></a>:' said Mâhitthi. And, verily, this libation of the fire-builder flows away as a libation of Soma which one offers on a (fire) without bricks.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:58">9:5:1:58</a></font></span>58. He need only lay down the naturally-perforated (bricks) <a name="fr_503"></a><a href="#fn_496"><font size="1">3</font></a>; for the naturally-perforated ones are these worlds; and this built fire-altar is the same as these worlds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:59">9:5:1:59</a></font></span>59. He need only lay down the seasonal (bricks); for the seasonal ones are the year, and this built fire-altar is the year.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:60">9:5:1:60</a></font></span>60. He need only lay down the all-light (bricks); for the all-light (bricks) are those deities <a name="fr_504"></a><a href="#fn_497"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and this built fire-altar is those deities.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:61">9:5:1:61</a></font></span>61. He need only lay down the Puna<i>s</i><i>k</i>iti; for this is a repeated sacrifice (punar-ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a), it is a later (higher) worship of the gods: it is thus a repeated sacrifice and the higher worship of the gods he thereby arranges, and the repeated sacrifice inclines to him <a name="fr_505"></a><a href="#fn_498"><font size="1">5</font></a>!--so (they say), but let him not do this,</p>

 <p>for, indeed, whenever Agni is placed on the built (altar), this whole Agni passes into that very brick <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_499"><font size="1">1</font></a>: thus whenever he offers in the fire, then these oblations of his will be offered even as would be his oblations, when offered on a complete <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:62">9:5:1:62</a></font></span>62. And, indeed, he who carries about Agni <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">2</font></a> becomes pregnant with all beings, and with all the gods; and he who builds him when he has not been carried about for a year kills all beings in the form of an embryo. But, surely, he who kills a human embryo, is despised, how much more then he who kills him (Agni), for he is a god: 'Let no one become an officiating priest for an (Agni) who has not been carried about for a year,' said Vâtsya, 'lest he should be a participator in the killing of this, a god's seed <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">3</font></a>!'</p>

'A six-month (Agni) is the last <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">1</font></a> he may build,' they say, 'for six-month embryos are the last <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">1</font></a> that live when born.' If he were to recite the Great Litany on one not carried for a year, he should recite (only) the eighties of verses, for something incomplete is (the Agni) not carried for a year, and something incomplete are the eighties of verses <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">2</font></a>. But, indeed, he would only still further pull asunder that (Agni, already) pulled asunder <a name="fr_512"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">3</font></a>; and, indeed, whether he (Agni) be carried for a year, or not carried for a year, he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) should recite the whole of the Great Litany.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:64">9:5:1:64</a></font></span>64. Now <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ilyâyana was once upon a time sojourning in the eastern region.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9:5:1:67">9:5:1:67</a></font></span>67. And, indeed, let him by all means build who offers the Agnihotra for a year, for he who offers the Agnihotra indeed supports him (Agni, the fire).</p>

And, indeed, let him by all means build who was born a year (after conception); for Agni is the breath; it is thus him (Agni) he holds. And, indeed, as the breath, he enters into the infused seed, and takes possession of it; and inasmuch as he takes possession (vid) of every one that is born (<i>g</i>âta), he is <i>G</i>âtavedas. Wherefore by all means let even one who knows this build him as one ever carried (within him). And, indeed, if one who knows this either drinks (Soma), or offers drink to any one else, these libations of his will be offered even as would be his libations, when offered on a complete <i>S</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>ila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.</p>

Kuhn, Zeitschr. f. v. Sprachf. II, p. 120; Weber, Ind. Stud. V, 230. Anumati is identified with the earth, V, 2, 3, 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_474"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_481">265:1</a> This is an etymological quibble resorted to in order to account for the oblation to Pra<i>g</i>âpati as one of the oblations of the goddesses (devikâ).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_478"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_485">265:5</a> For this expiatory ceremony, called the <i>S</i>ûlâvabh<i>ri</i>tha (spit-bath), <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a> and marking the conclusion of an ordinary (nirû<i>dh</i>a) animal sacrifice--not one belonging to the Soma-sacrifice--as well as of the offering of a sterile cow, see part ii, p. 215.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_480"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_487">266:2</a> See VI, 3, 1, 1 seq.; part iii, p. 290 seq.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_482"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_489">267:2</a> The Sâvitra formulas accompany eight libations, which form, however, only one single continuous offering (âhuti) with one svâhâ-call.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_483"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_490">267:3</a> For the seven <i>Ri</i>shis, identified with the vital airs, the first existing beings, see VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_484"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_491">267:4</a> Mahîdhara (and apparently Sâya<i>n</i>a) seems to supply 'ya<i>g</i>amânam' to 'etam,' and construe thus: 'Unto thee, O heavenly sent, I commit this (Sacrificer), which treasure <i>G</i>âtavedas shall bring thither.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_485"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_492">267:5</a> 'O gods, honour ye him (the Sacrificer)!' Mahîdhara; but perhaps the <i>Ri</i>shis are addressed in this second line. Mahîdhara takes 'atra' ('here') along with 'parame vyoman'--'in this highest heaven.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_486"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_493">268:1</a> See <a href="sbe4325.htm#8:6:3:23">VIII, 6, 3, 23</a>, <a href="sbe4325.htm#8:6:3:24">24</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_487"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_494">268:2</a> The meaning of the verse is, however, far from certain. The above is Mahîdhara's interpretation, except that he takes 'yâ<i>h</i>' to mean 'and what (other) streams there are.' It might, however, also mean--'What streams of honey and ghee of ours are never-failing anywhere--Agni Vai<i>s</i>vakarma<i>n</i>a shall deposit them in heaven with the gods!'--in which case due reward for sacrifice would be prayed for.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_488"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_495">269:1</a> According to VI, 1, 3, 20, the newly built Agni is to be called '<i>K</i>itra,' the Bright one.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_491"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_498">269:4</a> The Udavasânîyâ-ish<i>t</i>i, consisting of a cake on five potsherds for Agni (or a libation of ghee taken in five ladlings for Vish<i>n</i>u), is the same as for the Soma-sacrifice, IV, 5, I, 13. But whilst there it is followed at once by the (evening) Agnihotra, or oblation of milk regularly performed twice a day; on the present occasion an additional oblation is performed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_492"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_499">270:1</a> The same payasyâ-oblation is performed at the Dâkshâya<i>n</i>a modification of the new and full-moon sacrifice (II, 4, 4, 10 seq.); sec also the Sânnâyya of the new-moon sacrifice (part i, p. 178, note 4) which is the same dish.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_495"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_502">271:2</a> The meaning of this passage is not quite clear to me.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_496"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_503">271:3</a> The three Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs in the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers represent the three worlds. These, and the subsequent injunctions, refer to one who, subsequent to the Agni<i>k</i>ayana, wishes to perform a Soma-sacrifice, without being able to repeat the Agni<i>k</i>ayana itself. Katy. Sr. XVIII, 6, 33.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_497"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_504">271:4</a> See VI, 3, 3, 16; 5, 3, where the three Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotis bricks are said to represent Agni, Vâyu (wind), and Âditya (sun) respectively.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_498"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_505">271:5</a> Though there is nothing in the text to show where this quotation <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a> begins, it would seem, from Kâtyâyana's rules, that it runs from the beginning of paragraph 58,--XVIII, 6, 33. In case of inability (to perform a second) <i>k</i>ityâ, at a repeated Soma-sacrifice, (he may lay down) one or other kind of the Svayamât<i>ri</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>âs, Vi<i>s</i>va<i>g</i>yotishas, or <i>Ri</i>tavyâs; 34. The Puna<i>s</i><i>k</i>iti; 35. Or no building (at all a second time); 36. Because the (Agni) <i>K</i>itya has become the Âhavanîya.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_499"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_506">272:1</a> That is (as would seem from Sâya<i>n</i>a's interpretation), into the Âhavanîya fire, considered as the last brick of the altar; and hence the Sacrificer's offering-fire will for ever thereafter remain for him the <i>K</i>itya Agni.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_500"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_507">272:2</a> During the time of initiation (dîkshâ), which, if at all possible, is to last for a year, the Ukhya Agni has to be carried about by the intending Sacrificer, for at least part of each day, in the fire-pan (ukhâ), suspended in a sling from his neck; the pan-fire being afterwards transferred to the newly built Gârhapatya and thence to the great fire-altar, to serve as the <i>K</i>itya Agni, or the Âhavanîya fire. See VI, 7, I, 12 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_501"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_508">272:3</a> In the original this last clause is in the first person,, or in the <i>oratio directa</i>, from the point of view of him who is asked to officiate <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a> as a priest, hence--Let no one become an officiating priest . . ., thinking, 'Lest I should be a participator . . .'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_502"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_510">273:1</a> That is to say, he must have been carried about for at least six months; and embryos less than six months old cannot live.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_503"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_511">273:2</a> This is so for the reason that the Mahad uktham consists of more than the eighties of verses; see <a href="sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:19">IX, 3, 3, 19</a>. One might feel inclined to include this whole sentence in the preceding quotation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_504"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_512">273:3</a> That is, already too much attenuated, by being made as large as one a year old (?).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_505"></a><a href="sbe4343.htm#fr_513">273:4</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a remarks, that this reply does not restrict the building of the fire-altar to one who has carried the fire for a full year, but only discountenances the building in the case of one who has only carried it for a few days (?).</p>
