 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:1">8:2:4:1</a></font></span>1. 'The he-goat is vigour <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">1</font></a>,'--the he-goat he overtook by his vigour;--'gapless the metre,'--</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>the gapless metre, doubtless, is the Ekapadâ: in the form of Ekapadâ (metre) the goats indeed went forth (from Pra<i>g</i>âpati).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:2">8:2:4:2</a></font></span>2. 'The ram is vigour,'--the ram he overtook by his vigour;--'ample the metre,'--the ample metre, doubtless, is the Dvipadâ: in the form of the Dvipadâ the sheep indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:3">8:2:4:3</a></font></span>3. 'Man is vigour,'--the man he overtook by his vigour;--'slow the metre,'--the slow metre, doubtless, is the Paṅkti: in the form of the Paṅkti the men indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:4">8:2:4:4</a></font></span>4. 'The tiger is vigour,'--the tiger he overtook by his vigour;--'unassailable the metre,'--the unassailable metre, doubtless, is the Virâ<i>g</i>, for the Virâ<i>g</i> is food, and food is unassailable; in the form of the Virâ<i>g</i> the tigers indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:5">8:2:4:5</a></font></span>5. 'The lion is vigour,'--the lion he overtook by his vigour;--'the covering the metre,'--the covering metre, doubtless, is the Ati<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas, for that covers (includes) all metres: in the form of the Ati<i>k</i><i>kh</i>andas the lions indeed went forth. And so he places undefined metres along with defined beasts.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:6">8:2:4:6</a></font></span>6. 'The ox is vigour,'--the ox he overtook by his vigour;--'the B<i>ri</i>hatî the metre,'--in the form of the B<i>ri</i>hatî the oxen indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:7">8:2:4:7</a></font></span>7. 'The bull is vigour,'--the bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Kakubh the metre,'--in the form of the Kakubh the bulls indeed went forth.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:9">8:2:4:9</a></font></span>9. 'The bullock is vigour,'--the bullock he overtook by his vigour;--'the Paṅkti the metre,'--in the form of the Paṅkti the bullocks indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:10">8:2:4:10</a></font></span>10. 'The milch cow is vigour,'--the milch cow he overtook by his vigour;--'the <i>G</i>agatî the metre,'--in the form of the <i>G</i>agatî the milch cows indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:11">8:2:4:11</a></font></span>11. 'The calf of eighteen months is vigour,'--the calf of eighteen months he overtook by his vigour;--'the Trish<i>t</i>ubh the metre,'--in the form of the Trish<i>t</i>ubh the calves of eighteen months indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:12">8:2:4:12</a></font></span>12. 'The two-year-old bull is vigour,'--the two-year-old bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Virâ<i>g</i> the metre,'--in the form of the Virâ<i>g</i> the two-year-old kine indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:13">8:2:4:13</a></font></span>13. 'The bull of two years and a half is vigour,'--the bull of two years and a half he overtook by his vigour;--'the Gâyatrî the metre,'--in the form of the Gâyatrî the kine of two years and a half indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:14">8:2:4:14</a></font></span>14. 'The three-year-old bull is vigour,'--the three-year-old bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Ush<i>n</i>ih the metre,'--in the form of the Ush<i>n</i>ih the three-year-old kine indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:15">8:2:4:15</a></font></span>15. 'The four-year-old bull is vigour,'--the four-year-old bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Anush<i>t</i>ubh the metre,'--in the form of the Anush<i>t</i>ubh the four-year-old kine indeed went forth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:16">8:2:4:16</a></font></span>16. These then are those very beasts which Pra<i>g</i>âpati overtook by his vigour. The animal he (the priest) mentions first, then vigour, then the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>metre, for having hemmed them in with vigour and the metre, he put them into himself, and made them his own; and in like manner does he (the sacrificer) now hem them in with vigour and the metre, and put them into himself, and make them his own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:17">8:2:4:17</a></font></span>17. Now that animal is the same as Agni: (as such) he is even now made up whole and entire. Those (bricks) which he places in front are his head; those on the right and left sides are his body, and those behind his tail.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:18">8:2:4:18</a></font></span>18. He first lays down those in front, for of an animal that is born the head is born first. Having then laid down those on the right (south) side, he lays down those on the left (north) side, thinking, 'Together with its sides this body shall be born.' Then those behind, for of (the animal) that is born the tail is born last.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:19">8:2:4:19</a></font></span>19. The metres which are longest, and the animals which are biggest, he puts in the middle: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence the animal is biggest towards the middle. And the animals which are the strongest he puts on the right side: he thus makes the right side of an animal the stronger; whence the right side of an animal is the stronger.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:2:4:20">8:2:4:20</a></font></span>20. The fore and hind parts he makes smallest; for inasmuch as those (bricks in front) are only four in number <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a>, thereby they are the smallest; and inasmuch as here (at the back) he puts the smallest animals, thereby these are the smallest: he thus makes the fore and hind parts of an animal the smallest, whence the fore and hind parts of an animal</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p>are the smallest; and hence the animal rises and sits down by its fore and hind parts. He then lays down two Lokamp<i>ri</i><i>n</i>â (bricks) in that corner <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">1</font></a>: the significance of them (will be explained) further on <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">2</font></a>. He throws loose earth on the layer: the significance of this (will be explained) further on <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>
