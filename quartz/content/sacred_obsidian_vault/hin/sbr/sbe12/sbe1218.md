Now in former times the gods appointed Agni to the chief (office), namely, that of Hot<i>ri</i>; and having appointed him to the chief (office) saying 'do thou carry this our oblation!' they cheered him up, saying, 'Surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with vigour, even as in our own days, when they appoint any one from among their kinsmen to the chief (office), they cheer him up saying 'surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with vigour. By what, therefore, he recites after this, he eulogizes him, puts vigour into him <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:2">1:4:2:2</a></font></span>2. 'O Agni, thou art great! O priest (brâhma<i>n</i>a), O Bhârata!' for Agni, indeed, is the brahman</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (sacerdotium): therefore he says 'O Brâhma<i>n</i>a!--O Bhârata' he says, because he (Agni) bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods: therefore they say 'Agni is bhârata (the bearer).' Or, he, being the breath, sustains (bhar) these creatures: therefore he says 'O Bhârata (sustainer)!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:3">1:4:2:3</a></font></span>3. He now calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot<i>ri</i> priest) <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He thereby introduces him both to the <i>Ri</i>shis and to the gods (as if he were to say), 'Of great vigour is he who has obtained the sacrifice!' This is the reason why he calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot<i>ri</i>).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:4">1:4:2:4</a></font></span>4. He calls from the remote end (of the sacrificer's</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>ancestral line) downwards; for it is from the remote end downwards that a race is propagated. He (the Hot<i>ri</i>) also thereby propitiates the lord of seniority for him (the Sacrificer); for here among men the father comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he calls from the remote end downwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:5">1:4:2:5</a></font></span>5. Having named (him as) the ancestral one, he says, '(thou wert) kindled by the gods, kindled by Manu;' for in olden times the gods did kindle him: for this reason he says 'kindled by the gods;' and 'kindled by Manu' he says, because in olden times Manu did kindle him: for this reason he says 'kindled by Manu.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:6">1:4:2:6</a></font></span>6. He continues, 'Praised by the <i>Ri</i>shis (wert thou);' for in olden times the <i>Ri</i>shis did praise him: for this reason he says 'praised by the <i>Ri</i>shis.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:7">1:4:2:7</a></font></span>7. Further, 'Gladdened by bards (vipra);' for those bards, the <i>Ri</i>shis, indeed gladdened him: for this reason he says 'gladdened by bards.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:8">1:4:2:8</a></font></span>8. Further, 'Celebrated by sages (kavi);' for those sages, the <i>Ri</i>shis, indeed celebrated him: this is why he says 'celebrated by sages.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:9">1:4:2:9</a></font></span>9. Further, 'Sharpened by the brahman (the Veda or vedic formulas),' for he is indeed sharpened by the brahman;--'the receiver of butter-offerings,' for he is indeed the receiver of butter-offerings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:10">1:4:2:10</a></font></span>10. Further, 'The leader of oblations (ya<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a), the carrier of (Soma-)sacrifices (adhvara),' for through him they lead forward all oblations, both the domestic oblations and the others: this is why he says 'the leader of oblations.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:11">1:4:2:11</a></font></span>11. 'The carrier (rathî) of sacrifices;' for being a cart (as it were) he conveys the sacrifice to the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p>gods: this is the reason why he says 'the carrier of sacrifices.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:12">1:4:2:12</a></font></span>12. Further, 'The unsurpassed Hot<i>ri</i>, the surpassing bearer of oblations;' for him the Rakshas do not surpass (tar): for this reason he says 'the unsurpassed (atûrta) Hot<i>ri</i>.' 'The surpassing (tûr<i>n</i>i, rather 'swift') bearer of oblations,' for he overcomes (tar) every evil: therefore he says 'the surpassing bearer of oblations <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:13">1:4:2:13</a></font></span>13. Further, 'The mouth-vessel <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the offering-spoon of the gods;' for he, Agni, is indeed the vessel of the gods: therefore they make offerings in Agni to all the gods, he being the vessel of the gods. And, verily, whosoever knows this, obtains the vessel of him whose vessel he desires to obtain <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:14">1:4:2:14</a></font></span>14. Further, 'The cup from which the gods drink;' for from him, being (as it were) a cup, the gods drink (the Soma-libations): for this reason he says 'the cup from which the gods drink.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:15">1:4:2:15</a></font></span>15. Further, 'Thou, O Agni! dost encompass the gods, as the felly the spokes;' 'in the same way in which the felly on all sides encompasses the spokes, so dost thou on all sides encompass the gods,' this is what he thereby says.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:16">1:4:2:16</a></font></span>16. 'Bring hither the gods for the sacrificer!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may bring the gods</p>

 <p>to this sacrifice <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">1</font></a>.--'Bring Agni hither, O Agni!' this he says in order that he may bring Agni to the butter-portion intended for Agni.--'Bring Soma hither!' this he says in order that he may bring Soma to the butter-portion intended for Soma. 'Bring Agni hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may bring Agni hither to that indispensable <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">2</font></a> cake which is offered to Agni on both occasions (at the new- and the full-moon sacrifices).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:17">1:4:2:17</a></font></span>17. And (in the same way) according to the respective deities <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">3</font></a>. He then continues, 'Bring hither the butter-drinking gods!' this he says in order that he may bring hither the prayâgas and anuyâgas (fore and after-offerings), for the prayâgas and anuyâgas (represent) indeed the butter-drinking gods.--'Bring Agni hither for the Hot<i>ri</i>ship!' this he says in order that he may bring Agni hither for the office of Hot<i>ri</i>.<a href="errata.htm#5"></a>--'Your own greatness bring hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may</p>

 <p>bring hither his own greatness; his own greatness, in truth, is his voice: hence he says it in order that he may bring hither his voice <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">1</font></a>.--'Bring thou hither (the gods), O <i>G</i>âtavedas <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and offer up a good offering!' what deities he bids him bring hither, with regard to those (deities) he thereby says 'bring them hither!' When he says, 'offer up a good offering!' he means to say, 'sacrifice in the proper order!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:18">1:4:2:18</a></font></span>18. He recites (the invitatory prayer) <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">3</font></a> while standing, since it is yonder (sky) which he thereby recites; for, indeed, the invitatory prayer (signifies) yonder (sky), and by it he recites that which is yonder (sky). This is the reason why he recites standing.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:4:2:19">1:4:2:19</a></font></span>19. The offering-prayer <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">3</font></a> he pronounces while sitting, since the offering-prayer (represents) this (earth): hence no one pronounces the offering-prayer while standing; for the offering-prayer is</p>

 <p><a name="fn_302"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_303">114:2</a> The invocations he now proceeds to recite, on the termination of the sâmidhenîs or kindling verses, belong to the class of formulas called nigada. In the present case, they consist of the pravara mantra--or formula by which Agni is invited to assist the sacrificer as Hot<i>ri</i> or Invoker on the present occasion, as he has of old assisted his ancestors (cf. the following note)--and of short detached formulas called nivid. Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_303"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_304">115:1</a> Ârsheyam prav<i>ri</i>nîte, literally 'he chooses the ancestral' (<i>ri</i>shi). I take 'ârsheyam' as a masculine adjective qualifying a supplied '(Agni<i>m</i>) hotâram.' In this way the formula is explained by Sâya<i>n</i>a on I, 5, 1, 9 (<i>ri</i>shî<i>n</i>â<i>m</i> sambandhinam adhvaryur hotâra<i>m</i> v<i>ri</i><i>n</i>îte), and this seems to me the most natural interpretation. It is true, however, that, as the formula ('he chooses the ancestral') became stereotyped, its exact import became forgotten, and ârsheya was generally taken as a neuter, either adjective (viz. 'nâmadheyam,' 'apatyam') or noun (ancestral lineage). Agni is invoked as the one who has of old officiated as the Hot<i>ri</i> of the sacrificer's ancestors, three or five ancestral names being usually mentioned: thus, in the case of a sacrificer belonging to the <i>G</i>âmadagna Vatsa family, claiming Bh<i>ri</i>gu, <i>K</i>yavana, Apnavâna, Aurva, and <i>G</i>amadagni as its founders, Agni is invoked, on the present occasion, as 'Bhargava <i>K</i>yavana Âpnavâna Aurva <i>G</i>âmadagna!' (Â<i>s</i>val. Sr. 12, 10, 6; Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8). If the sacrificer belongs to the Kshatriya or Vai<i>s</i>ya castes, the priest substitutes for the sacrificer's ancestors those of his family priest (purohita) or his spiritual guide (guru); and in the case of kings the same course was adopted, or the names of their royal <i>ri</i>shi ancestors (râ<i>g</i>arshi) were chosen. As to the second pravara, or the election of the human Hot<i>ri</i>, for the present sacrifice, see I, 5, 1, 1. Cf. Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 386 seq.; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 325 seq.; X, 78 seq.; M. Haug, Aitar. Br., Translation, p. 479.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_304"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_305">117:1</a> At this point of the recitation a pause is made, during which (as already partly during the preceding recitation) the Adhvaryu and Âgnîdhra engage in the acts detailed in I, 4, 4, 13 seq. Cf. Hillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. p. 81.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_305"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_306">117:2</a> Âs-pâtram: the fire is, as it were, the vessel into which the sacrificial food is thrown and from which it is eaten by the gods.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_306"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_307">117:3</a> ? Sâya<i>n</i>a supplies 'food:' he obtains the vessel of that food of which he wishes to obtain the vessel.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_307"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_308">118:1</a> Here begins what is called the devatânâm âvahanam, or invitation (lit, bringing) of the deities to the oblations. Whilst the Hot<i>ri</i> recites these formulas, the Adhvaryu performs what is set forth in I, 4, 5, 2 seq.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_308"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_309">118:2</a> A<i>k</i>yuta, lit. 'not fallen,' i.e. immutable, invariable. For the legendary explanation of this epithet of Agni and his oblation, see I, 6, 1, 6; 2, 5-6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_309"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_310">118:3</a> The three preceding invocations are used alike at the new- and full-moon sacrifices, but the subsequent ones differ according to the oblations that are made, viz. a rice-cake to Indra-Agni (or an oblation of mixed milk and butter to Indra) at the new-moon ceremony; and to Agni-Soma at the full-moon sacrifice. Previously to these an upâ<i>m</i><i>s</i>uyâ<i>g</i>a or 'low-voiced oblation' is made by some to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and one to Vish<i>n</i>u (or to Agni-Soma) at the new-moon sacrifice; according to others also one to Pra<i>g</i>âpati,--the names of the gods being whispered in the respective formulas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_310"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_311">119:1</a> Sâya<i>n</i>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 9 explains the formula 'Bring hither the own greatness' by 'bring hither whatever greatness or power is peculiar to each of the havis-eating gods,' and he remarks expressly that it is not to be referred to Agni, as our author certainly appears to do. Cf. I, 7, 3, 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_311"></a><a href="sbe1218.htm#fr_312">119:2</a> <i>G</i>atavedas probably means 'he who knoweth (all) beings,' but it is more generally explained by 'he who possesseth riches (or wisdom),' not to mention other interpretations. According to Haug, Ait. Br. vol. ii. p. 224, the proper meaning of the term is 'having possession of all that is born, i.e. pervading it.' He further mentions that the <i>Ri</i>shis are quite familiar with the idea of the fire being an all-pervading power; and that by Gâtavedas the 'animal fire' is particularly to be understood. Our present formula 'â <i>k</i>a vaha <i>g</i>âtaveda<i>h</i> suya<i>g</i>â <i>k</i>a ya<i>g</i>a' somewhat differs from the corresponding formula of the Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5, 'â <i>k</i>âgne devân vaha suya<i>g</i>â <i>k</i>a ya<i>g</i>a <i>g</i>âtaveda<i>h</i>.'</p>
