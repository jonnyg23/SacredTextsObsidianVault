 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:1">1:8:1:1</a></font></span>1. In the morning they brought to Manu <a name="fr_506"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">1</font></a> water for washing, just as now also they (are wont to) bring (water) for washing the hands. When he was washing himself, a fish came into his hands.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:2">1:8:1:2</a></font></span>2. It spake to him the word, 'Rear me, I will save thee!' 'Wherefrom wilt thou save me?' 'A flood will carry away all these creatures <a name="fr_507"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">2</font></a>: from that I will save thee!' 'How am I to rear thee?'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:3">1:8:1:3</a></font></span>3. It said, 'As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish. Thou wilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:4">1:8:1:4</a></font></span>4. It soon became a <i>gh</i>asha (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish) <a name="fr_508"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Thereupon it said, 'In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou</p>

 <p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a></p>  
 <p>shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship <a name="fr_509"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">1</font></a>; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:5">1:8:1:5</a></font></span>5. After he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And in the same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the advice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen, he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he <a name="fr_510"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">2</font></a> passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:6">1:8:1:6</a></font></span>6. It then said, 'I have saved thee. Fasten the ship to a tree; but let not the water cut thee off <a name="fr_511"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">3</font></a>, whilst thou art on the mountain. As the water</p>

 <p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p>subsides, thou mayest gradually descend!' Accordingly he gradually descended, and hence that (slope) of the northern mountain is called 'Alarm's descent <a name="fr_512"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' The flood then swept away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained here.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:7">1:8:1:7</a></font></span>7. Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a pâka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid <a name="fr_513"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">2</font></a> she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a met her.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:8">1:8:1:8</a></font></span>8. They said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Manu's daughter,' she replied. 'Say (thou art) ours,' they said. 'No,' she said, 'I am (the daughter) of him who begat me.' They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree <a name="fr_514"></a><a href="#fn_511"><font size="1">3</font></a>, but passed by them. She came to Manu.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:9">1:8:1:9</a></font></span>9. Manu said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Thy daughter,' she replied. 'How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?' he asked. She replied,</p>

 <p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 219</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 'Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!' He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:10">1:8:1:10</a></font></span>10. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:11">1:8:1:11</a></font></span>11. Now this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the I<i>d</i>â; and whosoever, knowing this, performs with (the) I<i>d</i>â <a name="fr_515"></a><a href="#fn_512"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he propagates this race which Manu generated; and whatever blessing he invokes through it (or her), all that is granted to him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:12">1:8:1:12</a></font></span>12. It (the i<i>d</i>â) consists of a fivefold cutting; for the i<i>d</i>â, doubtless, means cattle, and cattle consist of five parts <a name="fr_516"></a><a href="#fn_513"><font size="1">2</font></a>: for this reason it (the i<i>d</i>â) consists of a fivefold cutting.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:13">1:8:1:13</a></font></span>13. When he (the Adhvaryu) has cut off the i<i>d</i>â piece by piece <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_514"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and broken off the fore-part of the</p>

 <p>cake (for the sacrificer's portion), he puts it (the latter) down (on the barhis) before the dhruvâ-spoon. Having then handed over the former (the i<i>d</i>â) to the Hot<i>ri</i> <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_515"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he passes by him towards the south.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:14">1:8:1:14</a></font></span>14. He anoints the Hot<i>ri</i> here <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">2</font></a> (with clarified butter taken from the i<i>d</i>â); and with it the Hot<i>ri</i> anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of the mind, I eat for sap, for out-breathing!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:15">1:8:1:15</a></font></span>15. He then anoints the Hot<i>ri</i> here <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_516"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and with it the Hot<i>ri</i> anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of speech, I eat for strength, for in-breathing!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:16">1:8:1:16</a></font></span>16. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), 'This (part) of my sacrifice--that is, this i<i>d</i>â representing the domestic offering--is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>injure my sacrifice at this place.' Accordingly by that (butter, taken from the i<i>d</i>â, and smeared on his lips) he promoted it (the i<i>d</i>â to a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one also thereby promotes (the i<i>d</i>â to a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And though he does not (at present) eat (the i<i>d</i>â) visibly, lest he should eat it before it is invoked, he nevertheless promotes it (to a safe place), when he smears the (butter) on his lips.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:17">1:8:1:17</a></font></span>17. He now cuts off piece by piece (the avântare<i>d</i>â) in (or, into) the Hot<i>ri</i>'s hand. That which is cut up piece by piece he thus makes visibly enter <a name="fr_521"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">1</font></a> the Hot<i>ri</i>; and through that which has entered (or is cooked in) his own self, the Hot<i>ri</i> invokes a blessing on the sacrificer: for this reason he cuts it off piece by piece in the Hot<i>ri</i>'s hand <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_518"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:18">1:8:1:18</a></font></span>18. He now calls <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_519"><font size="1">3</font></a> (the i<i>d</i>â) in a low voice. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), 'This (part) of my sacrifice--that is, this i<i>d</i>â</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>representing the domestic offerings--is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not injure my sacrifice at this place.' He accordingly called it to him in a low voice (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one (the Hot<i>ri</i>) thereby calls it (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:19">1:8:1:19</a></font></span>19. He calls thus (in a low voice) <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_520"><font size="1">1</font></a>, 'Hither is called the Rathantara (chant), together with the earth: may the Rathantara, together with the earth, call me <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">2</font></a>! Hither is called the Vâmadevya (chant), together with the atmosphere: may the Vâmadevya, together with the atmosphere, call me! Hither is called the B<i>ri</i>hat (chant), together with the sky: may the B<i>ri</i>hat, together with the sky, call me!' In thus calling her (the I<i>d</i>â) to him, he calls to him both these (three) worlds and those chants <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:20">1:8:1:20</a></font></span>20. 'Hither are called the cows <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">4</font></a>, together with the</p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>bull!'--the i<i>d</i>â, assuredly, means cattle: hence it is her he thereby calls in an indirect (mystic) way; (and in saying), 'together with the bull,' he calls her together with her mate.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:21">1:8:1:21</a></font></span>21. 'Hither is called (I<i>d</i>â) by that (sacrifice) which is performed by the seven Hot<i>ri</i>s!'--he thereby calls her by the Soma-sacrifice performed by the seven Hot<i>ri</i>s <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:22">1:8:1:22</a></font></span>22. 'Hither is called I<i>d</i>â, the conquering!'--he thereby calls her directly. 'Conquering' he says, because she overcomes evil, and for that reason he calls her 'the conquering.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:23">1:8:1:23</a></font></span>23. 'Hither is called the friend, the food <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">2</font></a>!'--the friend, the food, doubtless, means breath: hence he thereby calls hither the breath. 'Hither is called the Hek <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">3</font></a>!'--he thereby calls hither the (body of i<i>d</i>â), he thereby calls hither the entire (i<i>d</i>â).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:24">1:8:1:24</a></font></span>24. He now intones (in a loud voice): 'I<i>d</i>â is called hither! Hither (thither) is called I<i>d</i>â! May I<i>d</i>â also call us to her!' In saying, 'I<i>d</i>â is called</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>hither,' he, in a direct way, calls her, who is thereby called hither, as being what she really was: a cow, assuredly, she was, and a cow is four-footed; and therefore he calls her four times <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:25">1:8:1:25</a></font></span>25. But in calling her four times, he calls her in different ways, in order to avoid repetition (of sacrificial performance); for, if he were to call, 'I<i>d</i>â is called hither! I<i>d</i>â is called hither!' or 'Hither is called Ida! hither is called I<i>d</i>â!' he would indeed commit the (fault of) repetition. By saying, 'I<i>d</i>â is called hither!' he calls her hitherwards; and by 'Hither (or thither, lit. called to somebody) is called I<i>d</i>â!' he calls her thitherwards. By saying, 'May I<i>d</i>â also call us to her,' he does not omit himself, and, besides, it (the formula) is changed. By (the second), 'I<i>d</i>â is called hither!' he again calls her hitherwards; so that he thereby (and by the second, 'Hither is called I<i>d</i>â,' again) calls her hitherwards and thitherwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:26">1:8:1:26</a></font></span>26. 'Manu's daughter, the butter-pathed (gh<i>ri</i>tapadî);'--Manu, indeed, begat her of old: for this reason he says, 'Manu's daughter.' 'The butter-pathed' he says, because butter gathered in her footprint: therefore he calls her 'butter-pathed.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:27">1:8:1:27</a></font></span>27. And further, 'She who belongs to Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a;'--this 'Maitrâvaru<i>n</i>a nature' (is hers), because she met Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">2</font></a>.--'She, the god-fashioned one, is called hither as the Brahman <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">3</font></a>;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>for she, the god-fashioned one, is indeed called hither as their Brahman.--'Hither are called the divine Adhvaryus, called hither the human!'--he thereby calls both the divine Adhvaryus and those that are human: the divine Adhvaryus indeed are the calves <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">1</font></a> (vatsâ<i>h</i>), and what others there are, are the human ones.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:28">1:8:1:28</a></font></span>28. '--They who are to prosper this sacrifice, they who are to prosper the lord of sacrifice.' Those Brâhma<i>n</i>as, who have studied and teach the Veda, assuredly prosper the sacrifice, since they spread (perform) and produce it: these he thereby propitiates. And the calves also assuredly make the lord of sacrifice prosper; for the lord of sacrifice who possesses abundance of them, does indeed prosper; for this reason he says, 'They who are to prosper the lord of sacrifice.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:29">1:8:1:29</a></font></span>29. 'Hither are called the primeval, law-abiding, divine (fem.) heaven and earth, whose sons are gods.' He thereby calls to him those two, heaven and earth, within which all this (universe) is embraced.--'Hither is called this sacrificer:' thereby he calls the sacrificer to him. Why he does not mention his name on this occasion, is that this is a mysterious benediction on the i<i>d</i>â. Were he, on the contrary, to mention the name, he would do what is human, and the human certainly is inauspicious at the sacrifice: hence he does not mention</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>the name, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:30">1:8:1:30</a></font></span>30. 'Hither (he is) called for future worship of the gods;' he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on this (sacrificer); for as he sacrificed heretofore, so, while living, he will sacrifice hereafter.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:31">1:8:1:31</a></font></span>31. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of offspring for him; for whosoever has offspring,--while he, on his part, goes to yonder world, his offspring sacrifice in this world: hence future worship of the gods means offspring.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:32">1:8:1:32</a></font></span>32. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of cattle for him; for whosoever has cattle, will sacrifice hereafter, as he has sacrificed heretofore.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:33">1:8:1:33</a></font></span>33. 'Hither (he is) called for more abundant havis-offering;' he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on him; for as he has sacrificed heretofore, so while living will he hereafter again and again make offerings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:34">1:8:1:34</a></font></span>34. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of offspring for this (sacrificer); for whosoever possesses offspring,--though he, of his own self, be one only, yet that offering is made tenfold by his offspring: hence offspring means more abundant offering.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:35">1:8:1:35</a></font></span>35. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of cattle for him; for whosoever possesses cattle, will make offering again and again, as he has sacrificed heretofore.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:36">1:8:1:36</a></font></span>36. This then is the benediction (implied in these formulas), 'May I live, may I have offspring, may</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> I obtain prosperity!' Now in praying for the blessing of cattle, he prays for prosperity; for cattle means prosperity: hence through these two benedictions everything is obtained; and therefore these two benedictions are here pronounced.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:37">1:8:1:37</a></font></span>37. [He continues to call], 'Hither (he is) called to this (sacrifice, for the prayer <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">1</font></a>), "May the gods graciously accept this my offering (havis)!''' he thereby invokes complete success on the sacrifice; for what offering the gods graciously accept, by that one gains great things: for this reason he says, 'may they graciously accept <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:38">1:8:1:38</a></font></span>38. They (the priests and sacrificer) eat it (the i<i>d</i>â), and do not offer it up in the fire; for assuredly the i<i>d</i>â means cattle: hence they do not offer it in the fire, lest they should throw the cattle into the fire.</p>  
 <p>39. In the vital airs rather it is offered, partly in the Hot<i>ri</i>, partly in the Sacrificer, partly in the Adhvaryu. Now, when he has broken off the forepart of the (Agni) cake, he places it before the dhruvâ-spoon. But the dhruvâ represents the sacrificer: hence this will be eaten by the sacrificer. And if he does not now visibly eat it, lest he should eat before the sacrifice is completed, it nevertheless is now (symbolically) eaten by him. All of them</p>

 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p>eat (of the i<i>d</i>â): 'May it be offered for me in all!' thus (he thinks). Five eat of it,--the i<i>d</i>â indeed means cattle, and cattle are fivefold: hence five eat of it.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1:8:1:40">1:8:1:40</a></font></span>40. Now when he (the Hot<i>ri</i>) intones (in a loud voice) <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he (the Adhvaryu) divides the (Agni) cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis (the sacrificial grass covering the altar). Here it lies in place of the fathers; for there are four intermediate quarters, and the intermediate quarters represent the fathers: for this reason he divides the cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>

The Âgnîdhra eats (the two pieces), with the respective texts (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 10-11), 'Hither is called mother Earth; may mother Earth call me to her! Agni (am I) by virtue of my Âgnîdhraship. Hail!' 'Hither is called father Heaven; may father Heaven call me to him! Agni (am I) by virtue of my Âgnîdhraship. Hail!' He, the Âgnîdhra, truly is the representative of heaven and earth, and therefore he eats (the sha<i>d</i>avatta) in this manner.</p>

'Bald war er ein Grossfisch (<i>gh</i>asha), denn er wuchs gewaltig,' Weber. 'He became soon a large fish. He said to Manu, "When I am full-grown, in the same year the flood will come,"' Max Müller. 'Straightway he became a large fish; for he waxes to the utmost,' Muir. Perhaps <i>gh</i>asha is here intended for the name of some fabulous horned fish (cf. <i>s</i><i>ri</i>ṅgi, <i>s</i><i>ri</i>ṅgî). In the Black Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda (Taitt. S. I, 7, 1; II, 6, 7) the <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 217</font></a> i<i>d</i>â is represented as a cow, produced by Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a (see below, par. 24). Perhaps it was this version and the symbolical representation of the i<i>d</i>â as meaning cattle, which suggested the notion of a horned fish, in adapting an older legend.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_506"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_509">217:1</a> I adopt here, though not without hesitation, the interpretation proposed in the St. Petersb. Dict. (s.v. upa-âs), which the separation of mâm from the verb favours. Professor Max Müller translates: 'Build a ship then, and worship me.' Dr. Muir: 'Thou shalt, therefore, construct a ship, and resort to me.' The Mahâbhârata has: 'When standing on the ship, thou shalt look out for me: I shall be recognisable (by my being) furnished with a horn,' which, after all, may furnish the correct explanation of our passage.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_507"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_510">217:2</a> Or, 'it,' that is, either the ship, or the fish. That abhi-dudrâva, the reading of the Kâ<i>n</i>va school, is the right one, seems to follow from the next paragraph. Professor Weber's edition has ati-dudrâva, as read by his best MS., 'it (or he) sailed across the mountain.' The reading of the other MSS. adhi-dudrâva must be a clerical error, most likely for abhi-dudrâva. Professor Müller translates: 'The fish carried him by it over the northern mountain.' Dr. Muir: 'By this means he passed over (or, he hastened to) this northern mountain.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_514"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_517">219:3</a> The technical expression used for this fivefold cutting of the i<i>d</i>â is sam-ava-do, 'to cut off completely (or together),' or, according to the St. Petersb. Dict., 'to divide and collect the <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a> pieces.' The five cuttings of the i<i>d</i>â consist of the upastara<i>n</i>a, or underlayer of butter in the i<i>d</i>âpâtrî; of two cuttings of each of the havis (or dishes of sacrificial food) from their southern and central parts respectively; and of two drippings (or bastings, abhighâra<i>n</i>a) of butter, as in the case of the svish<i>t</i>ak<i>ri</i>t (see Kâty. III, 4, 6, and note on I, 7, 3, 20). According to some authorities, the i<i>d</i>â consists of four cuttings only (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 122).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_515"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_518">220:1</a> According to Kâty. III, 4, 8, 9, he does so without quitting his hold of the i<i>d</i>â; and he withdraws the latter from the Hot<i>ri</i>; when he anoints him.</p>

Â<i>s</i>v. <i>S</i>. I, 7, 1; Kâty. III, 4, 9; Hillebrandt, op. cit., p. 124. In <i>S</i>at. Br. XII, 2, 4, 5 the fore-finger is called annâditamâ, or the finger 'which eats most food;' cf.

I, 7, 3, and comm., is effected in the following way: the Hot<i>ri</i> takes the i<i>d</i>â with his joined hands (a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ali) and makes it lie in his left hand; whereupon the Adhvaryu cuts the (fivefold cut) avântare<i>d</i>â from the i<i>d</i>â into the Hot<i>ri</i>'s right hand, the fingers of which point northwards; the five cuttings apparently consist of the 'underlayer' of butter, two pieces cut from the i<i>d</i>â, and drippings of butter on them. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., p. 125.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_519"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_523">221:3</a> During the invocation of the i<i>d</i>â the Hot<i>ri</i> holds the butter (as well as the avântare<i>d</i>â), and the other priests (except the Brahman) and the sacrificer touch the i<i>d</i>â (or, according to Karka, the Hot<i>ri</i>).

The commentator remarks: 'He says, The divine Adhvaryus assuredly are the calves,' because, in his opinion, the sânnâyya constitutes the sacrificial food which contains the Adhvaryus (havis--adhvaryuvat).

Called (he is) of (? by) everything dear that is called!' Taitt, Br. III, 5, 9, 3. For the modifications of the concluding mantras in the case of the i<i>d</i>â being invoked for the mistress of the house (<i>S</i>at. Br. I, 9, 2, 5), see Taitt. Br, III, 5, 13.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_534"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_538">228:1</a> Viz. 'I<i>d</i>a is called hither!' see par. 24. According to Kâty. III, 4, 12, all (the other priests and the sacrificer, probably with the exception of the Brahman) touch the i<i>d</i>â (or, according to Karka, they touch the Hot<i>ri</i> who holds the i<i>d</i>â) whilst the invocation of the i<i>d</i>â takes place. The quartering of the cake, according to ib. 13, is done with the text, 'Make swell, O ruddy one! milk me life; milk me offspring; milk me cattle; milk me brahmahood; milk me kshatriyahood; milk me people! Fatten through the progeny, through the cattle of him who hates us, whom we hate!'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_535"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_539">228:2</a> According to Kâty. III, 4, 14, the Adhvaryu puts the four parts on the barhis and assigns one to each priest. But according to the commentary and to other Sûtras, it is the sacrificer who allocates the portions by laying them down so as to correspond with the four intermediate regions, commencing in the south-east (or Agni's) region, and saying, 'This for the Brahman,' 'This for the Hot<i>ri</i>,' 'This for the Adhvaryu,' 'This for the Agnîdh.' The sacrificer then shifts his Brâhmanical cord from the right to the left shoulder, and while touching the four portions, and looking towards the south (the region of the fathers), murmurs (Vâ<i>g</i>. S. II, 31), 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither (âv<i>ri</i>shâyadhvam) each to his own share!' He then quits his hold of the portions, and murmurs, 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they came each to his own share!' See <i>S</i>at. Br. II, 4, 2, 20 seq.; Vâ<i>g</i>. S. p. 57. [The Kâ<i>n</i>va text of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a does not mention the formulas here any more than does our author.] He then shifts the cord back on his left shoulder, touches water, and hands the portions to the priests for them to eat.

II, 10 remarks: When the Hot<i>ri</i> pronounces the call to heaven and earth, then he (the Adhvaryu), having put one piece of each of the two cakes in (the two bowls of) the Sha<i>d</i>avatta (vessel), gives it to the Agnîdh; and the latter eats it with the formulas 'Hither is called (the mother Earth),' &amp;c. The 'six cuttings' of the Sha<i>d</i>avatta consist of a piece of the Agni cake with an 'underlayer' and a dripping of butter for each of the two bowls of the Sha<i>d</i>avatta dish.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_537"></a><a href="sbe1234.htm#fr_541">229:2</a> That is, the formula 'Hither is called the sacrificer,' see par. 29.</p>
