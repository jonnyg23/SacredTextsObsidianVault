   <h2 align="center">II, 7. Charm against curses and hostile plots, undertaken with a certain plant.</h2>  
 <p>1. The god-begotten plant, hated by the wicked, which wipes away the curses (of the enemies), like water a foul spot it has washed away all curses from me.<br> 2. The curse of the rival and the curse of the kinswoman, the curse which the Brahman shall utter in wrath, all that (do thou put) under our feet!<br> 3. From heaven her root is suspended, from the earth it rises up; with her that has a thousand shoots do thou protect us on all sides!<br> 4. Protect me, protect my offspring, protect our goods; let not ill-will overcome us, let not hostile schemes overcome us!<br> 5. The curse shall go to the curser; joint possession shall we have with the friend. Of the enemy who bewitches with (his) eye we hew off the ribs.</p>
