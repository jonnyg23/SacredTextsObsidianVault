 <p>1. As a goddess upon the goddess earth thou wast born, O plant! We dig thee up, O nitatni, that thou mayest strengthen (the growth) of the hair.<br> 2. Strengthen the old (hair), beget the new! That which has come forth render more luxurious!<br> 3. That hair of thine which does drop off, and that which is broken root and all, upon it do I sprinkle here the all-healing herb.</p>
