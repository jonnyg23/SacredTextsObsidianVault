   <h2 align="center">II, 25. Charm with the plant prisniparnî against the demon of disease, called kanva.</h2>  
 <p>1. The goddess Prisniparnî has prepared prosperity for us, mishap for Nirriti (the goddess of destruction). For she is a fierce devourer of the Kanvas: her, the mighty, have I employed.<br> 2. The Prisniparnî was first begotten powerful; with her do I lop off the heads of the evil brood, as (the head) of a bird.<br> 3. The blood-sucking demon, and him that tries to rob (our) health, Kanva, the devourer of our offspring, destroy, O Prisniparnî, and overcome!<br> 4. These Kanvas, the effacers of life, drive into the mountain; go thou burning after them like fire, O goddess Prisniparnî!<br> 5. Drive far away these Kanvas, the effacers of life! Where the dark regions are, there have I made these flesh-eaters go.</p>
