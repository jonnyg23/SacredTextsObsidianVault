   <h2 align="center">II, 32. Charm to secure perfect health.</h2>  
 <p>1. From thy eyes, thy nostrils, ears, and chin--the disease which is seated in thy head--from thy brain and tongue I do tear it out.<br> 2. From thy neck, nape of the neck, ribs, and spine--the disease which is seated in thy fore-arm--from thy shoulders and arms I do tear it out.<br> 3. From thy heart, thy lungs, viscera, and sides; from thy kidneys, spleen, and liver we do tear out the disease.<br> 4. From thy entrails, canals, rectum, and abdomen; from thy belly, guts, and navel I do tear out the disease.<br> 5. From thy thighs, knees, heels, and the tips of thy feet--from thy hips I do tear out the disease seated in thy buttocks, from thy bottom the disease seated in thy buttocks.<br> 6. From thy bones, marrow, sinews and arteries; from thy hands, fingers, and nails I do tear out the disease.<br> 7. The disease that is in thy every limb, thy every hair, thy every joint; that which is seated in thy skin, with Kasyapa's charm, that tears out, to either side we do tear it out.</p>
