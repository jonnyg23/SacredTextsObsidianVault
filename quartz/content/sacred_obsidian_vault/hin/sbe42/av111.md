   <h2 align="center">VII, 35. An incantation to make a woman sterile.</h2>  
 <p>1. The other enemies conquer with might; beat back, O Gâtavedas, those that are not yet born! Enrich this kingdom unto happiness, may all the gods acclaim this man!<br> 2. Of these hundred entrails of thine, as well as of the thousand canals, of all these have I closed the openings with a stone.<br> 3. The upper part of the womb do I place below, there shall come to thee neither offspring nor birth! I render thee sterile and devoid of offspring; a stone do I make into a cover for thee.</p>
