 <p>So this Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land had eighty Deities his brethren; but they all left the land to the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land. The reason for their leaving it was this: Each of these eighty Deities had in his heart the wish to marry the Princess of Yakami <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_472"><font size="1">1</font></a> in Inaba, <a name="fr_477"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">2</font></a> and they went together to Inaba, putting their bag on [the back of] the Deity Great-Name-Possessor, whom they took with them as an attendant. Hereupon. when they arrived at Cape Keta, <a name="fr_478"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">3</font></a> [they found] a naked hare lying down. Then the eighty Deities spoke to the hare, saying: "What thou shouldest do is to bathe in the sea-water here, and lie on the slope of a high mountain exposed to the blowing of the wind." So the hare followed the instructions of the eighty Deities, and lay down. Then, as the sea-water dried, the skin of its body all split with the blowing of the wind, so that it lay weeping with pain. But the Deity Great-Name-Possessor, who came last of all, saw the hare, and said: "Why liest thou weeping?" The hare replied, saying: "I was in the Island of Oki, <a name="fr_479"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">4</font></a> and wished to cross over to this land, but had no means of crossing over. For this reason [69] I deceived the crocodiles <a name="fr_480"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the sea, saying: 'Let you</p>

 <p>and me compete, and compute the numbers of our [respective] tribes. So do you go and fetch every member of your tribe, and make them all lie in a row across from this island to Cape Keta. Then I will tread on them, and count them as I run across. Hereby shall we know whether it or my tribe is the larger.' Upon my speaking thus, they were deceived and lay down in a row, and I trod on them and counted them as I came across, and was just about to get on land, when I said: 'You have been deceived by me.' As soon as I had finished speaking, the crocodile who lay the last of all seized me and stripped off all my clothing. As I was weeping and lamenting for this reason, the eighty Deities who went by before [thee] commanded and exhorted me, saying: 'Bathe in the salt water, and lie down exposed to the wind.' So, on my doing as they had instructed me, my whole body was hurt." Thereupon the Deity Great-Name-Possessor instructed the hare, saying: "Go quickly now to the river-mouth, wash thy body with the fresh water, then take the pollen of the sedges [growing] at the river-mouth, spread it about, and roll about upon it, whereupon thy body will certainly be restored to its original state." <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_477"><font size="1">6</font></a> So [the hare] did as it was instructed, and its body became as it had been originally. This was the White Hare of Inaba. <a name="fr_482"></a><a href="#fn_478"><font size="1">7</font></a> It is now called the Hare Deity. So the hare said to the Deity Great-Name-Possessor: "These eighty Deities shall certainly not get the Princess of Yakami. Though thou bearest the bag, Thine Augustness shall obtain her."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_473"></a><a href="kj028.htm#fr_477">81:2</a> The name of a province not far from that of Idzumo. The word may possibly, as Motowori suggests, be derived from <i>ina-ba</i>, "rice-leaves."</p>

The meaning of the word <i>keta</i> is "the beams of a roof, the yards of a sail." But perhaps <i>Keta</i> and <i>keta</i> may be nothing more than homonyms of independent origin.</p>
