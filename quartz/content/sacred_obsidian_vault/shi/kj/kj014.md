 <p>the Deity Luxuriant-Food-Princess. <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">6</font></a> So the Deity [30] the Female-Who-Invites, through giving birth to the Deity-of-Fire, at length divinely retired. <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">7</font></a> (<small>Eight Deities in all from the Heavenly-Bird-Boat to the Deity Luxuriant-Food-Princess. <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">8</font></a></small>)</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The total number of islands given birth to jointly by the two Deities the Male-Who-Invites and the Female-Who-Invites was fourteen, and of Deities thirty-five.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_218"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_218">32:1</a> <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a> "Lying down" (<i>koyasu</i>) is a term often used in the Archaic language in the sense of "dying." But here it must be taken literally, the death ("divine retirement") of the goddess being narrated a few fines further on.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_219"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_219">32:2</a> <i>Kana-yama-biko-no-kami</i> and <i>Kana-yama-bime-no-kami</i>. The translation of this pair of names follows the plain sense of the characters <a name="img_03300"></a>
 <img src="img/03300.jpg"> with which they are written, and which seems appropriate enough, coming as they do between the deity of fire and deities of clay. Motowori however, declaring both characters to be merely phonetic, derives <i>kana-yama</i> from <i>korena-yamasu</i>, "to cause to wither and suffer." And interprets the names accordingly. This is at any rate ingenious.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_220">32:3</a> <i>Hani-yasu-biko-no-kami</i> and <i>Hani-yasu-bime-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_221"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_221">32:4</a> <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></a> The signification of this name is not to be ascertained. In the text it is written phonetically <a name="img_03400"></a>
 <img src="img/03400.jpg">, and two passages in the "Chronicles," where this deity is mentioned as <a name="img_03401"></a>
 <img src="img/03401.jpg"> and <a name="img_03402"></a>
 <img src="img/03402.jpg"> with directions in each case to read the name with the sounds here given to it, do not help us much, except in so far as they show that Mitsuhanome was conceived of as the deity of water and as a female.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_222">32:5</a> <i>Waku-musu-bi-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_223">33:6</a> <i>Toyo-uke-bime-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_224">33:7</a> <i>I.e.</i>, "died."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_225">33:8</a> There is here an error in the computation, as <i>nine</i> deities are mentioned. The total of thirty-five deities given immediately below is still more erroneous, as no less than <i>forty</i> are named in the preceding passage. Motowori makes an ingenious effort to reconcile arithmetic and revelation by supposing the five pairs of brothers and sisters with parallel names to have been considered as each forming but one day.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_226">33:9</a> See Sect. III. This island was not <i>born</i>, but arose, spontaneously from drops of brine.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_227"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_227">33:10</a> <i>Hiru-go</i>. See the latter part of Sect. IV for these two names, Hiru-go was not counted among the children of these Deities for the reason that the latter abandoned him as soon as he was born, he being a failure. The reason for omitting Aha from the computation is not so clear.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_228"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_228">33:11</a> The text here is very peculiar, the characters <a name="img_03403"></a>
 <img src="img/03403.jpg"> rendered "single child" being where we should expect <a name="img_03404"></a>
 <img src="img/03404.jpg"> or <a name="img_03405"></a>
 <img src="img/03405.jpg">. Hirata proposes to consider <a name="img_03406"></a>
 <img src="img/03406.jpg">, "tree," while most scholars agree in reading <i>ke</i> instead of <i>ki</i> in this place, as phonetic for <i>ke</i> (<a name="img_03407"></a>
 <img src="img/03407.jpg">) "hair," and to interpret the god's words to signify that he values the child no more than a single hair in comparison with the wife whom that child's birth has lost for him. Moribe, in his "Examination of Difficult Words." s.v. <i>Ko no hito-tsu ki</i> (Vol. I. p. 8 <i>et seq.</i>), ingeniously argues that <i>ki </i>was an old native Japanese "Auxiliary Numeral" for animals, afterwards driven out by the somewhat like-sounding Chinese word <i>hiki</i> (<a name="img_03408"></a>
 <img src="img/03408.jpg">) which is now in common use, and that the god employs this degrading Auxiliary Numeral in speaking of his child on account of the resentment which he feels against him. On the other hand we gather from the "Chronicles of Japan Explained" that <a name="img_03409"></a>
 <img src="img/03409.jpg"> was used in its natural sense as an "Auxiliary Numeral" for gods and for men of exalted rank. This seems to the translator the better view to follow, and it is supported by the use of <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a> <a name="img_03500"></a>
 <img src="img/03500.jpg"> <i>hashira</i>, as the regular "Auxiliary Numeral" for divine personages. The parallel passage in the "Chronicles" has simply <a name="img_03501"></a>
 <img src="img/03501.jpg"> "one infant."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_229"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_229">33:12</a> This rendering is but tentative; for it is not certain that Hirata, whose view has been adopted, is right in regarding Konomoto and Unewo as names of places. If we followed the older authorities, we should have to translate thus: "The Deity that dwells at the foot of the trees on the slope of the spur of Mount Kagu." The etymology of the name of this celebrated mountain (known also as <i>Ame-no-kagu-yama</i> or <i>Ama-no-kagu-yama</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "Heavenly Mount Kagu") is disputed. But Hirata's view, according to which it should be connected with <i>kago</i>, "deer," is the most plausible. If it were established, we should be tempted to follow him in rendering by "deer-possessor" the name of the deity <i>Kagu-tsu-chi</i>, of whom were born the eight gods of mountains, and whose slaying forms the title of the next section. That the fire-deity should be connected with the mountain-deities, and thereby with the deer who roam about the mountains and furnish the hunter with a motive for penetrating into their recesses, is of course but natural. The character <a name="img_03502"></a>
 <img src="img/03502.jpg"> with which Kagu is written signifies "fragrant"; but it has been suggested that the Japanese word may be connected with an <a href="errata.htm#10">expression</a> signifying "heaven-descended," in allusion to the supposed origin of the mountain as related in an old geographical work (now lost) treating of the Province of Iyo.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_230">33:13</a> <i>Naki-saha-me-no-kami</i>. The sense of the second word of the compound is "marsh" or "stream but Motowori seems right in considering the character <a name="img_03503"></a>
 <img src="img/03503.jpg"> to be here used phonetically as an abbreviation of <i>isaha</i> from <i>isatsu</i>, "to weep."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_231"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_231">33:14</a> <i>I.e.</i>, dead.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_232"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_232">33:15</a> Etymology uncertain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_233"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_233">33:16</a> For this name see Sect. XIX, Note 6.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_234"></a><a href="kj014.htm#fr_234">33:17</a> Etymology uncertain.</p>
