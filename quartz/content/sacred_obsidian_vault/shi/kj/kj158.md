 <p>So the Shiraka Clan <a name="fr_2297"></a><a href="#fn_2292"><font size="1">1</font></a> was established as the august proxy of Prince Shiraka. Again the Hatsuse-Clan-Retainers <a name="fr_2298"></a><a href="#fn_2293"><font size="1">2</font></a> were established. At this time there came over people from Kure. Again the Kahase Retainers <a name="fr_2299"></a><a href="#fn_2294"><font size="1">3</font></a> were established. These people from Kure <a name="fr_2300"></a><a href="#fn_2295"><font size="1">4</font></a> were lodged <a name="fr_2301"></a><a href="#fn_2296"><font size="1">5</font></a> at Kure-hara. So the place was called by the name of Kure-hara. <a name="fr_2302"></a><a href="#fn_2297"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_2293"></a><a href="kj158.htm#fr_2298">388:2</a> <i>Hatuse-be no tomire</i>. This clan was called after the reigning Emperor. Remember that the word "Retainers" is here a "gentile name."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2294"></a><a href="kj158.htm#fr_2299">388:3</a> <i>Kahase no toneri</i>. <i>Kaha-se</i> signifies "river-reach," and the "Chronicles," under date of the eleventh year of this reign, tell a story of the appearance of a white cormorant, to commemorate which this family was established. Cormorants, it will be remembered, were used for catching fish in rivers; hence the appropriateness of the name bestowed on the family in question.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2295"></a><a href="kj158.htm#fr_2300">388:4</a> The name given by the early Japanese to Wu (<a name="img_38800"></a>
 <img src="img/38800.jpg">), an ancient state in Eastern China to the South of the Yang-tzo River. In Japanese it however, like other names of portions of China, often denotes the whole of that country in a somewhat vague manner. The derivation the word <i>Kura</i> is obscure. The most acceptable proposition is that which would see in it corruption of the original Chinese term <i>Wu</i>, of which <i>Go</i> is the Sinico-Japanese pronunciation. But what of the second syllable <i>re</i>?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2296"></a><a href="kj158.htm#fr_2301">388:5</a> The phrase <a name="img_38801"></a>
 <img src="img/38801.jpg"> is in this place used for "lodged."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2297"></a><a href="kj158.htm#fr_2302">388:6</a> <i>I.e.</i>, Kure Moor. It is in Yamato. According to the "Chronicles," the former name of the place had been <i>Himokuma-nu</i>.</p>
