When he had thus been harassed, he bowed his head, <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">1a</font></a> saying: "I <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">2a</font></a> henceforward will be Thine Augustness's guard by day and night, and respectfully serve thee."

"One account" in the "Chronicles" relates these antics at full, telling us that they represented the straits to which he was put as the waters gradually rose higher and higher; and we learn from other passages in the same work and in the "Chronicles of Japan Continued" that the <i>Hayabito</i> did really down to historical times combine the office of Court Jesters with that of Imperial Guardsmen.</p>
