 <p>Thereupon the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land lamented himself, and said: "How shall I alone be able to make this land? <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">2</font></a> Together with what Deity can I make this land?" At this time there came a Deity illuminating the sea. This Deity said: "If thou wilt lay me to rest <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">3</font></a> well, I can make it together with thee. If not, the land cannot be made." Then the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land said: "If that be so, what is the manner of reverently laying thee to rest?" He replied, saying: "Reverently worship me on Yamato's green fence, the eastern mountain's top." <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">4</font></a> This is the Deity who dwells on the top of Mount Mimoro. <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_582"></a><a href="kj035.htm#fr_586">106:3</a> <i>I.e.</i> "if thou wilt build me a temple." The original might also be rendered "if thou wilt worship before me," or "at my shrine," of "if thou wilt establish a temple to me."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="kj035.htm#fr_587">106:4</a> <i>I.e.</i> on Mount Mimoro which stands as a protecting fence in the eastern part of the province of Yamato. <i>Awo-kaki-yama</i>, "green fence mountain," became a proper name used alternatively for Mount Mimoro (or, according to the later pronunciation, Mimuro). In like manner <i>Himukashi-yama</i> (in the later language <i>Higashi-yama</i>) "eastern mountain," has by some been considered to be a proper name.</p>
