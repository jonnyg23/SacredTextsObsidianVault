LXXX. EMPEROR KEI-KŌ (PART V.—YAMATO-TAKE SLAYS THE KUMASO BRAVOES).]</h2>  
 <p>Thereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, alarmed at the valour and ferocity of his august child's disposition, commanded him, saying: "In the West there are two Kumaso bravoes, <a name="fr_1568"></a><a href="#fn_1564"><font size="1">1</font></a>—unsubmissive and disrespectful men. So take <a name="fr_1569"></a><a href="#fn_1565"><font size="1">2b</font></a> them,"—and [with this command] he sent him off. It happened that at this time his august hair was bound at the brow. <a name="fr_1570"></a><a href="#fn_1566"><font size="1">3b</font></a> Then His Augustness Wo-usu was granted by his aunt Her Augustness Yamato-hime <a name="fr_1571"></a><a href="#fn_1567"><font size="1">4</font></a> her august [upper] garment and august skirt; and, with a sabre hidden in his august bosom, he went forth. <a name="fr_1572"></a><a href="#fn_1568"><font size="1">5</font></a> So, on reaching the house of the Kumaso bravoes, he saw that near the house there was a three-fold belt of warriors, who had made a cave <a name="fr_1573"></a><a href="#fn_1569"><font size="1">6</font></a> to dwell in. Hereupon they, noisily discussing a rejoicing for the august cave, <a name="fr_1574"></a><a href="#fn_1570"><font size="1">7</font></a> were getting food ready. So [Prince Wo-usu sauntered about the neighbourhood, waiting for the day of the [207] rejoicing. Then when the day of the rejoicing came, having combed down after the manner of girls his august hair which was bound up, <a name="fr_1575"></a><a href="#fn_1571"><font size="1">8</font></a> and having put on his aunt's august [upper] garment and august skirt, he looked quite</p>

 <p>like a young girl, and, standing amidst the women, <a name="fr_1576"></a><a href="#fn_1572"><font size="1">9</font></a> went inside the cave. Then the elder brother and the younger brother, the two Kumaso bravoes, delighted at the sight of the maiden, set her between them, and rejoiced exuberantly. So, when [the feast was] at its height, [His Augustness Wo-usu], drawing the sabre from his bosom, and catching Kumaso <a name="fr_1577"></a><a href="#fn_1573"><font size="1">10</font></a> by the collar of his garment, thrust the sabre through his chest, whereupon, alarmed at the sight, the younger bravo ran out. But pursuing after and reaching him at the bottom of the steps <a name="fr_1578"></a><a href="#fn_1574"><font size="1">11</font></a> of the cave, and catching him by the back, <a name="fr_1579"></a><a href="#fn_1575"><font size="1">12</font></a> [Prince Wo-usu] thrust the sabre through his buttock. Then the Kumaso bravo spoke, saying: "Do not move the sword; I <a name="fr_1580"></a><a href="#fn_1576"><font size="1">13</font></a> have something to say." Then [His Augustness Wo-usu], respited him for a moment, holding him down [as he lay] prostrate. Hereupon [the bravo] said: "Who is Thine Augustness?" Then he said: "I am the august child of Oho-tarashi-hiko-oshiro-wake, the Heavenly Sovereign who, dwelling in the palace of Hishiro at Makimuku, rules the Land of the Eight Great Islands; and my name is King Yamato-wo-guna. Hearing that you two [fellows <a name="fr_1581"></a><a href="#fn_1577"><font size="1">14</font></a>], the Kumaso bravoes, were unsubmissive and disrespectful, [the Heavenly Sovereign] sent me with the command to take and slay you." Then the Kumaso bravo said: "That must [208] be true. There are no persons in the West so brave and strong as we two. <a name="fr_1582"></a><a href="#fn_1578"><font size="1">15</font></a> Yet in the Land of Great Yamato there is a man braver than we two,—there is. <a name="fr_1583"></a><a href="#fn_1579"><font size="1">16</font></a> Therefore will I offer thee an august name. From this time forward it is right that thou be praised as the August Child Yamato-take." <a name="fr_1584"></a><a href="#fn_1580"><font size="1">17</font></a> As soon as he had finished saying this, [the Prince] ripped him up <a name="fr_1585"></a><a href="#fn_1581"><font size="1">18</font></a> like a ripe</p>

When he returned up [to the capital] after doing this, he subdued and pacified every one of the Deities of the mountains and of the Deities of the rivers and likewise of the Deities of Anado, <a name="fr_1589"></a><a href="#fn_1585"><font size="1">22</font></a> and then went up to [the capital].</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1565"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1569">255:2b</a> Motowori seems right in interpreting "take" here and elsewhere in the sense of "slay." But "take "is in the text.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1568"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1572">255:5</a> The characters used for these last two words are those properly restricted to the mention of an Imperial progress, but Yamato-take is constantly spoken of as if he had actually sat on the throne.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1569"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1573">255:6</a> The character used is <a name="img_25700"></a>

 <p><a name="fn_1570"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1574">255:7</a> Motowori reads "<i>New</i> cave," but the word "August" is in the text. At the same time we see that this feast was intended as a house-warming. <i>Conf</i>. the commencement of Sect. CLXIV.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1571"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1575">255:8</a> The parallel passage of the "Chronicles" puts the same meaning into plainer words. It says: "undid his hair, and made it appear like a girl's."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1572"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1576">256:9</a> Or, according to the old reading, "mixing with the concubines."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1573"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1577">256:10</a> <i>I.e.</i>, the elder bravo of Kumaso.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1574"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1578">256:11</a> The word rendered "steps" is of doubtful interpretation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1575"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1579">256:12</a> Or perhaps "the skin of his back" or "the (beast's?) skin on his back." But Motowori is probably right in supposing the character <a name="img_25701"></a>
 <img src="img/25701.jpg">, "skin" to be an error for <a name="img_25702"></a>
 <img src="img/25702.jpg">, "with," to be construed with the word "sabre." (In the English idiom this Particle falls away.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1576"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1580">256:13</a> Written with the humble character <a name="img_25703"></a>

 <p><a name="fn_1578"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1582">256:15</a> There is Motowori's authority for thus understanding the bravo's words. Taken still more literally, they would seem to imply that there were no brave and strong men in the West <i>excepting</i> himself and his brother.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1579"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1583">256:16</a> The words "there is" are an attempt at rendering the termination keri of the original. See X, Note 1.</p>

 <img src="img/25800.jpg">, "broke," in the text is, as the commentators observe, an evident error for <a name="img_25801"></a>
 <img src="img/25801.jpg">, "ripped."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1582"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1586">257:19</a> Or specifically, the "musk melon."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1583"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1587">257:20</a> The translator has followed Motowori's restoration of this passage, in which, by the transposition of the characters <a name="img_25802"></a>
 <img src="img/25802.jpg"> and <a name="img_25803"></a>
 <img src="img/25803.jpg">, the end of this sentence and the beginning of the next were mixed together in the older editions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1584"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1588">257:21</a> Lit., "[they] praised the august name, calling him," etc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1585"></a><a href="kj087.htm#fr_1589">257:22</a> Or, "of the Ana passage" (lit. door), the modern Strait of Shimonoseki. The word <i>ana</i> signifies "hole," and there is a tradition (which Motowori quotes in his note on this name in Vol. XXVII, pp. 26-29 of his Commentary) to the effect that formerly the Main bland and the island of Kiushiu were continuous at this point, there being only a sort of natural tunnel, through which junks could pass.</p>
