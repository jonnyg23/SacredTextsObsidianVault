 <p><a name="fn_192"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_192">28:1</a> <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a> <i>Oho-koto-oshi-wo-no-kami</i>. "The Male-Enduring-Great-Things" would be a possible, but less good rendering. This god is identified by Motowori with <i>Koto-toke-no-wo</i> mentioned in "One account" of the "Chronicles of Japan."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_193"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_193">28:2</a> The original <i>Ika-tsuchi-biko-no-kami</i> (<a name="img_02900"></a>
 <img src="img/02900.jpg">) is identified by Motowori with <i>Uha-zutsu-no-wo</i>, (<a name="img_02901"></a>
 <img src="img/02901.jpg">) mentioned in Sect. X (Note 18). He would interpret the first <i>tsu</i> (<i>dzu</i>) as the Genitive particle and the second as identical with the "Honorific appellation <i>ji</i> of males," such as <i>Hikoji</i>, <i>Oho-to-no-ji</i>, etc. If this surmise were correct, the entire name would signify Upper-Lord-Prince; but it is safer to be guided by the characters in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_194"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_194">28:3</a> <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a> <i>Iha-zu-bime-no-kami</i>. Here too Motowori takes the syllable <i>zu-</i> to be "connected with" the syllables <i>tsu-tsu</i> interpreted as above, forgetting apparently that the second <i>tsu</i> (<i>ji</i>) is said to occur only in the names of males.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_195"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_195">28:4</a> <i>Oho-to-bi-wake-na-kami</i>, a name which Motowori, by supposing corruptions of the text and by making a plentiful use of the pliant and powerful system of derivation with which the Japanese etymologists lay siege to the difficulties of their language, identifies with <i>Oho-naho-bi-no-kami</i>, "the Great-Rectifying-Wondrous-Deity," mentioned in Sect. X (Note 16).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_196"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_196">28:5</a> <i>Ame-no-fuki-wo-no-kami,</i> identified by Motowori with <i>I-buki-do-nushi</i> mentioned in the "Ritual of the General Purification." (See his Commentary on this Ritual, Vol. II, pp. 29-32.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_197"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_197">28:6</a> <i>Ohoyabikonokami</i>, identified by Motowori with <i>Oho-aya-tsui-bi</i> mentioned in "One account" of the "Chronicles."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_198"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_198">28:7</a> <i>Kaza-ge-tsu-wake-no-oshi-wo-no-kami</i>. Motowori's conjectural interpretation has been followed; but both the reading and the meaning of the original are encompassed with difficulties. Motowori identifies this deity with <i>Soko-sasura-hime</i> mentioned in the "Ritual of the General Purification."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_199"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_199">28:8</a> <i>Oho-wata-tsu-mi-no-kami</i>. The interpretation of <i>mochi</i>, "possessor," though not absolutely sure, has for it the weight both of authority and of likelihood.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_200"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_200">28:9</a> <i>I.e.</i>, river-mouths, estuaries, or ports. In the original <i>Minato-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_201"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_201">28:10</a> <i>Haya-aki-dzu-hiko</i>. <i>Aki</i>, whose proper signification is "autumn," might also by metonymy be interpreted to mean "dragon-fly" or "Japan." Motowori, <i>àpropos</i> of this name, launches forth on very bold derivations and identifications with the names of other gods. The original of the sister-deity is <i>Haya-aki-dzu-hime-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_202"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_202">28:11</a> The text here omits the word "Swift" from this name.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_203"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_203">28:12</a> The original names of this deity and the three that follow are <i>Awa-nagi-no-kami</i>, <i>Awa-nami-no-kami</i>, <i>Tsura-nagi-no-kami</i>, and <i>Tsura-nami</i>, <i>no-kami</i>. The interpretation of the component parts is open to doubt but that here adopted has the authority of Motowori and Hirata.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_204"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_204">28:13</a> <i>Ame-no-mi-kumari-no-kami</i>. The following deity is <i>Kuni-nomi-kumari-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_205"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_205">28:14</a> <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a> This Deity and the next are in the original <i>Ame-no-ku-hiza-mochi-no-kami</i> and <i>Kuni-ito-ku-hiza-mochi-no-kami</i>. The etymology is obtained by comparison with a passage in the "Ritual for Averting Fire" (<a name="img_03100"></a>
 <img src="img/03100.jpg">).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_206"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_206">28:15</a> <i>Shina-tsu-hiko-no-kami</i>. The original of this name is explained by Motowori, who founds his view on two passages in the "Collection of a Myriad Leaves," to signify Prince-of-Long-<i>Breath</i>. But the translator feels confident that <i>shi-na</i> by him interpreted in the sense of "long breath" (or rather "long of breath") should he connected with <i>shi</i>, an old word for wind which we see in <i>ara-shi</i> ("storm-wind"), <i>ni-shi</i> ("west-wind"), <i>hi-gashi</i> ("east wind"), and perhaps under a slightly altered form in <i>kaze</i>, "wind," whereas shi nowhere occurs in the sense of "breath." Hirata notices approvingly this etymology of <i>shi</i> ("Exposition of the Ancient Histories," Vol. III. p. 63), though without venturing flatly to contradict his <a href="errata.htm#8">predecessor's</a> decision as to the import of the name in question. The difference in the meaning is after all slight. <i>Na</i> is to be taken as an apocopated form of <i>nagaki</i>, "long." In later times <i>Shinato</i> has been used as a name for the north-west wind.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_207"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_207">28:16</a> Such seems to be the meaning of the original <i>Kuku-no-chi-no-kami</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_208"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_208">29:17</a> <i>Oho-yama-tsuna-ka-mi</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_209"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_209">29:18</a> <i>Kaya-nu-kimi-no-kami</i>. The etymology of the alternative personal name (in the original <a href="errata.htm#9"><i>Nu-dzu-chi-no-kami</i></a> is not quite certain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_210"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_210">29:19</a> The original of these two names is <i>Ame-no-sa-dzu-chi-no-kami</i> and <i>Kuni-no-sa-dzu-chi-no-kami</i>. Their signification is obscure, but the translator has, after some hesitation, followed Motowori's interpretation. The words "heavenly" and "earthly" should probably be considered as qualifying "passes." This word "pass," used here and elsewhere to render the Japanese term <i>saka</i> (<i>sa</i>), must be understood to include lesser ascents than those very arduous ones which are alone denoted by the word "pass" in ordinary English parlance. In the later language of Japan the word <i>tauge</i> (<i>tōge</i>) generally denotes "passes" properly so called, while <i>saka</i> is restricted to the meaning of small ascents or hills. But this distinction is by no means strictly observed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_211"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_211">29:20</a> <i>Ame-no-sa-giri-no-kami</i> and <i>Kuni-no-sagiri-no-kami</i>. <i>Sa</i> seems to be rightly considered, as in the two preceding names, to be an archaic form of <i>saka</i> (properly <i>sa-ka</i>, "hill-place"), and <i>giri</i> as an apocopated form of <i>kagiri</i>, (properly <i>ka-giri</i>, "place-cutting") "limit" or "boundary". Hirata however, following the Chinese character with which <i>kiri</i> is written, interprets it in the sense of "mist."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_212">29:21</a> <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a> <i>Ame-no-kura-do-no-kami</i> and <i>Kuni-no-kura-do-no-kami</i>. Motowori explains <i>kura</i> (<a name="img_03200"></a>
 <img src="img/03200.jpg">, "dark") by <i>tani</i> (<a name="img_03201"></a>
 <img src="img/03201.jpg">, "valley"), and <i>to</i> "door" by <i>tokoro</i> (<a name="img_03202"></a>
 <img src="img/03202.jpg">, "place").</p>
 <p><a name="fn_213"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_213">29:22</a> Such appears to be the proper interpretation of the original of these two names, <i>Oko-tomato-hiko-no-kami</i> and <i>Oho-tomato-hime-no-kami</i>, <i>tomato</i> being plausibly referred to <i>towomaru</i> and <i>tawamu</i>. It is difficult to find an English word to represent exactly the idea, which is rather that of a gentle <i>fold</i> in the mountains than of the narrower and steeper hollow which we call a "valley."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_214"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_214">29:23</a> <i>I.e.</i>, the Prince-Who-Invites and the Princess-Who-Invites (<i>Izanagi</i> and <i>Iza-nami</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_215"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_215">29:24</a> <i>Tori-no-iha-kusa-bune-no-kami</i>. The alternative name is <i>Ame-no-tori-bune</i>, from which the title of Deity is omitted. Motowori's Commentary, Vol. V, pp. 52-53 should be consulted on the subject of this deity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_216"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_216">29:25</a> Homonymous with the alternative personal name of the Island of Aha. (See Sect. V, Note 8).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_217"></a><a href="kj013.htm#fr_217">29:26</a> <i>Hi-no-haya-yagi-wo-no-kami</i>. If, as seems likely, <i>yagi</i>, is an incorrect reading for <i>kagi</i>, we should have to translate by "shining" the word here rendered "burning." The alternative names are <i>Hino-kaga-biko-no-kami</i> and <i>Hino-kaga-tsuchi-no-kami</i>. In "One account" of the "Chronicles" and elsewhere in the "Rituals" this fire-god is called <i>Ho-musubi</i> <i>i.e.</i> the Fire-Producer."</p>
