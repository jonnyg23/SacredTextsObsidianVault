 <i></i><p>A PRIEST FROM THE CAPITAL.<br>
 A PRIEST OF AKASAKA (really the ghost of the robber KUMASAKA NO CHOHAN).<br>
 CHORUS.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>These weary feet that found the World<br>
 Too sad to walk in, whither<br>
 Oh whither shall wandering lead them?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I am a priest from the Capital. I have never seen the East Country, and now I am minded to go there on pilgrimage.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>He describes the journey, walking slowly round the stage</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Over the mountains, down the Ōmi road by a foam-flecked stream;<br>
 And through the woods of Awazu.<br>
 Over the long bridge of Seta<br>
 Heavily my footfall clangs.<br>
 In the bamboo-woods of Noji I await the dawn.<br>
 There where the Morning dew lies thick, over the Greenfield Plain,<br>
 Green in name only--for the leaves are red with autumn--<br>
 In evening sunshine to the village of Akasaka I am come!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>It is convenient to call him this, but he is the ghost of Kumasaka, appearing in the guise of a priest</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Hey, you priest, I have something to say to you!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>What is it you would say to me?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a></p>
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>To-day is some one's birthday. I beg of you to pray for the salvation of his soul.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I have left the World, and it is my business now to say such prayers; but of whom am I to think when I pray?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There is no need to know his name. He is buried in that tomb over there, among the rushes to this side of the pine-tree. It is because he cannot get free <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a> that he needs your prayers.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>No, no; it will not do. I cannot pray for him unless I know his name.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Pray, none the less. For it is written, "All the creatures of the world shall be profited.<br>
 There shall be no distinction."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>From dying and being born.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Deliver him, oh deliver him!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>For he that taketh a prayer unto himself<br>
 Even though his name be not named, if he receive it gladly,<br>
 Is the owner of the prayer.<br>
 Was not the promise made to the trees of the field,<br>
 To the soil of the land? Though the heart that Prays marks no name upon the prayer,<br>
 Yet shall it be heard.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then come back to my cottage with me and pass the night there.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I will come.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>They go into the cottage, which is represented by a wicker framework at the front</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Listen! I thought you were taking me to where there would be a chapel, so that I could begin my prayers. But here I ran see no painted picture nor carven image that I could put up. There is nothing on the wall but a great pike,--no handstaff, but only an iron crowbar; and other weapons of war are nailed up. What is the reason of this?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>You must know that when I first took the vows of priesthood I went round from village to village here, to Tarui, Anhaka and Akasaka--there is no end to them, but I know all the roads,--through the tall grass at Aono and the thick woods of Koyasu, night or day, rain or fine. For I was a hill-bandit in those days, a thief of the night, tilting baggage from mules' backs; even stripping servant-girls of their clothes, as they went from farm to farm, and leaving them sobbing.</p>
 <p>Then it was that I used to take with me that pike there and waving it in their faces, "Stand and deliver!" I would cry.</p>
 <p>But at last a time came when it was not so. <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">1</font></a> And after that time I was glad enough to find shelter even in such a place as this. I yielded my will and was content. For at last I had indeed resolved to leave the hateful World.</p>
 <p>Oh petty prowess of those days!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>For hand of priest unfit indeed<br>
 Such deeds and weapons had I thought;<br>
 Yet among gods<br>
 Hath not the Lord Amida his sharp sword?<br>
 Doth not the King of Love <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 Shoot arrows of salvation from his bow?<br>
 Tamon with tilted lance<br>
 Outbattled demons and hath swept away<br>
 All perils from the world.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>

 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Thoughts of love and pity<br>
 May be sins fouler</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Than the Five Faults of Datta; <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 And the taking of life for faith<br>
 Be holiness greater<br>
 Than the six virtues of Bosatsu. <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 These things have I seen and heard.<br>
 But for the rest, is it not Thought alone<br>
 That either wanders in the trackless night<br>
 Of Error or awakes to the wide day?<br>
 "Master thy thoughts, or they will master thee,"<br>
 An ancient proverb <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">3</font></a> says.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Speaking for Kumasaka</i>.)</p>
 <p>"But I must have done, or dawn will find me talking still. Go to your rest, Sir; and I too will doze awhile." So he spoke, and seemed to go into the bedroom. But suddenly the cottage vanished: nothing was left but the tall grass. It was under the shadow of a pine-tree that he <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">4</font></a> had rested!</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>There is usually an interlude to occupy the time while Kumasaka is changing his costume. An inhabitant of Akasaka tells stories of Kumasaka's exploits</i>.)</p>
 <p>PRIEST.</p>
 <p>I have seen strange things. I cannot sleep, no, not even for a while as little as the space between the antlers of a young stag. Under this autumn-winded pine-tree lying, all night long I will perform a service of chanted prayer. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <dir>
 
 <p>See how the branches are heaving.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The moon does not rise till dawn to-night; and even when she rises she will be covered.</p>
 <p>Send along the order for an assault!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Recollecting himself</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The whole heart divided between bow-hand and rein-hand,--oh the sin of it! For ever seizing another's treasure! Look, look on my misery, how my heart clings to the World!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>If you are Kumasaka himself, tell me the story of those days.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There was a merchant, a trafficker in gold, called Kichiji of the Third Ward. Each year he brought together a great store, and loading it in bales carried it up-country. And thinking to waylay him I summoned divers trusty men. . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Tell me the names of those that were chosen by you and the countries they came from.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There was Kakujō of Kawachi, and the brothers Surihari that had no rivals in fencing.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Well, and from within the City itself among many there were--</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There was Emon of the Third Ward and Kozaru of Mibu.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Skilful torch-throwers; in broken-attack</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Their like will never be seen.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And from the North country, from Echizen</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There was Matsuwaka of Asau and Kurō of Mikuni.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And from the country of Kaga, from Kumasaka</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There was this Chōhan, the first of them, a great hand at deeds of villainy; and with him seventy men of the band.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>On all the roads where Kichiji might be passing, up hill and down dale on every halting-place they spied, till at last</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Here at the Inn of Akasaka we found him,--a fine place, with many roads leading from it. We set watch upon the place. The merchants had sent for women. From nightfall they feasted. They roystered the hours away--</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And at last, very late at night,<br>
 Kichiji and his brother, with no thought for safety,<br>
 Fell into a sodden sleep.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>But there was with them a boy of sixteen. <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 He put his bright eye to a hole in the wall.<br>
 He did not make the least noise.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a></p>
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>He did not sleep a wink.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Ushiwaka! We did not know he was there.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then the robbers, whose luck was run out,</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Thinking that the hour of fortune was come,</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Waited impatiently.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh how long it seemed till at last the order came.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Dash in!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And, hurling their firebrands,<br>
 In they rushed, each jostling to be first,<br>
 More of them and more, in a wild onslaught.<br>
 Not even the God of Peril had dared to face them.<br>
 But little Ushiwaka showed no fear.<br>
 He drew his belt-sword and met them.<br>
 The Lion Pounce, The Tiger Leap, The Bird Pounce . . . <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 He parried them all. They thrust at him but could not prevail.<br>
 Thirteen there were who attacked him;<br>
 And now, done to death, on the same pillow head to head they lie.<br>
 And others, wounded, have flung down their swords and slunk back weaponless,<br>
 Stripped of all else but life.<br>
 Then Kumasaka cried: "What demon or god can he be<br>
 Under whose hand all these have fallen? For a man he cannot be!<br>
 But even robbers need their lives! This is no work for me; I will withdraw."<br>
 And slinging his pike, slowly he turned to go.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a></p>
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I was thinking.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>He was thinking as he went,<br>
 "Though this stripling slash so bravely,<br>
 Yet should Kumasaka employ his secret art,--<br>
 Then though the boy be ogre or hobgoblin,<br>
 Waist-strangled he would be pressed to dust."<br>
 "I will avenge the fallen," he cried, and, turning back,<br>
 He levelled his pike ;and sheltered behind the wattled door,<br>
 Waiting for the urchin to come.<br>
 Ushiwaka saw him, and drawing his sword held it close to his side,<br>
 Stood apart and watched. But Kumasaka too stood with his pike ready.<br>
 Each was waiting for the other to spring.<br>
 Then Kumasaka lost patience. He lunged with his left foot and with his pike<br>
 Struck a blow that would have pierced an iron wall.<br>
 But Ushiwaka parried it lightly and sprang to the left.<br>
 Kumasaka was after him in a moment, and as he sprang nimbly over the pike, <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Turned the point towards him.<br>
 But as he drew back the pike, Ushiwaka crossed to the right.<br>
 Then levelling the pike, Kumasaka struck a great blow.<br>
 This time the boy parried it with a blow that disengaged them,<br>
 And springing into the air leapt hither and thither with invisible speed.<br>
 And while the robber sought him,<br>
 The wonderful boy pranced behind and stuck his sword through a chink in his coat of mail.<br>
 "Hey, what is that?" cried Kumasaka. "Has this urchin touched me?"<br>
 And he was very angry.<br>
 But soon Heaven's fatal ordinance was sealed by despair:<br>
 "This sword-play brings me no advantage," he cried; "I will wrestle with him."<br>
 Then he threw away his pike, and spreading out his great hands, <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a><br>
 Down this corridor and into this corner he chased him, but when he would have grasped him,<br>
 Like lightning, mist, moonlight on the water,--<br>
 The eye could see, but the hand could not touch.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I was wounded again and again.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>He was wounded many times, till the fierce strength of his spirit weakened and weakened. Like dew upon the moss that grows.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KUMASAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Round the foot of this pine-tree</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Are vanished the men of this old tale.<br>
 "Oh, help me to be born to happiness."</p></dir>
