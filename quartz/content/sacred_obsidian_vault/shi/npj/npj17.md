 <p>No whence nor whither know I, only onward,<br>
 Onward my way.</p></dir>

 <p>I am a holy man of no fixed abode. I have been travelling through the land of Shinano; but the snow lies thick. I had best go up to Kamakura now and wait there. When Spring comes I will set out upon my pilgrimage.</p>

 <p>Land of Shinano, Peak of Asama,<br>
 Thy red smoke rising far and near! Yet cold<br>
 Blows the great wind whose breath<br>
 From Greatwell Hill is fetched.<br>
 On to the Village of Friends--but friendless I,<br>
 Whose self is cast aside, go up the path<br>
 Of Parting Hill, that from the temporal world<br>
 Yet further parts me. Down the river, down<br>
 Runs my swift raft plank-nosed to Plank-nose Inn,<br>
 And to the Ford of Sano I am come.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I have travelled so fast that I am come to the Ford of Sano in the country of Kōzuke. Ara! It is snowing again. I must seek shelter here. (Goes to the wing and knocks.) Is there anyone in this house?</p>

 <p>Ah! How the snow falls! Long ago when I was in the World <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">1</font></a> I loved to see it:<br>
     "Hither and thither the snow blew like feathers plucked from a goose;<br>
     Long, long I watched it fall, till it dressed me in a white coat."<br>
 So I sang; and the snow that falls now is the same that I saw then. But I indeed am frost-white <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">2</font></a> that watch it!<br>
     Oh how shall this thin dress of Kefu-cloth <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
     Chase from my bones the winter of to-day,<br>

 <p>I would gladly ask you to stay, but there is scarce space for us two, that are husband and wife. How can we give you lodging? At the village of Yamamoto yonder, ten furlongs further, you will find a good inn. You had best be on your way before the daylight goes.</p></dir>

 <p>Alas, it is because in a former life we neglected the ordinances <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">1</font></a> that we are now come to ruin.

 <p>If you are of that mind, why did you not speak before? (<i>Looking after the</i> PRIEST.) No, he cannot have gone far in this great snowstorm. I will go after him and stop him. Hie, traveller, hie! We will give you lodging. Hie! The snow is falling so thick that he cannot hear me. What a sad plight he is in. Old-fallen snow covers the way he came and snow new-fallen hides the path where he should go. Look, look! He is standing still. He is shaking the snow from his clothes; shaking, shaking. It is like that old song:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"At Sano Ferry<br>
 No shelter found we<br>
 To rest our horses,<br>
 Shake our jackets,<br>
 In the snowy twilight."</p></dir>
 </dir>

 <p>But now at Sano on the Eastern Way<br>
 Would you wander weary in the snow of twilight?<br>

 </dir>

 <dir>
 
 <p>It happens that we have a little boiled millet; <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">1</font></a> we can give him that if he will take it.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I will tell him. (<i>To the</i> PRIEST.) I have given you lodging, but I have not yet laid anything before you. It happens that we have a little boiled millet. It is coarse food, but pray eat it if you can.</p></dir>

 <p>I will do so.</p></dir>

 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>

 <p>Long ago when I was in the World I knew nothing of this stuff called millet but what I read of it in poems and songs. But now it is the prop of my life.</p>
 <p>Truly Rosei's dream of fifty years' glory<br>
 That he dreamed at Kántán on lent pillow propped<br>
 Was dreamed while millet cooked, as yonder dish now.<br>
 Oh if I might but sleep as he slept, and see in my dream<br>
 Times that have passed away, then should I have comfort;<br>
 But now through battered walls</p></dir>

 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>How cold it is! And as the night passes, each hour the frost grows keener. If I had but fuel to light a fire with, that you might sit by it and warm yourself! Ah! I have thought of something. I have some dwarf trees. I will cut them down and make a fire of them.</p></dir>
 </dir>

 <dir>
 
 <p>Have you indeed dwarf trees?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yes, when I was in the World I had a fine show of them; but when my trouble came I had no more heart for tree-fancying, and gave them away. But three of them, I kept,--plum, cherry and pine. Look, there they are, covered with snow. They are precious to me; yet for this night's entertainment I will gladly set light to them.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>No, no, that must not be. I thank you for your kindness, but it <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a> is likely that one day you will go back to the World again and need them for your pleasure. Indeed it is not to be thought of.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>

 Shall flower but with flame."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>

 <p>You now, O pine, whose branches I had thought<br>
 One day when you were old to lop and trim,<br>
 Standing you in the field, a football-post, <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Such use shall never know.<br>
 Tree, whom the winds have ever wreathed<br>
 With quaking mists, now shimmering in the flame<br>
 Shall burn and burn.<br>
 Now like a beacon, sentinels at night<br>
 Kindle by palace gate to guard a king,<br>
 Your fire burns brightly.<br>

 <p>How came it, sir, that you fell to such misery?</p></dir>

 <p>By further mischance it happens that Lord Saimyōji <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a> himself is absent upon pilgrimage. And yet not all is lost; for on the wall a tall spear still hangs, and armour with it; while in the stall a steed is tied. And if at any time there came from the City news of peril to our master--</p>
 <p>Then, broken though it be I would gird this armour on,<br>
 And rusty though it be I would hold this tall spear,<br>
 And lean-ribbed though he be I would mount my horse and ride<br>
 Neck by neck with the swiftest,<br>
 To write my name on the roll.<br>
 And when the fight began<br>
 Though the foe were many, yet would I be the first<br>
 To cleave their ranks, to choose an adversary<br>
 To fight with him and die.</p></dir>

 <p>"And should you one day come up to the City, seek for me there. A humble priest can give you no public furtherance, yet can he find ways to bring you into the presence of Authority.

 <p>Hie, you travellers! Is it true that the levies are marching to <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a> Kamakura? They are marching in great force, you say? So it is true. Barons and knights from the Eight Counties of the East all riding to Kamakura! A fine sight it will be. Tasselled breastplates of beaten silver; swords and daggers fretted with gold. On horses fat with fodder they ride; even the grooms of the relay-horses are magnificently apparelled. And along with them (<i>miming the action of leading a horse</i>) goes Tsuneyo, with horse, armour and sword that scarce seem worthy of such names.

 <p>Have you forgotten the priest whom once you sheltered from the snowstorm? You have been true to the words that you spoke that night at Sano:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"If at any time there came news from the City of peril to our master<br>
 Then broken though it be, I would gird this armour on,<br>
 And rusty though it be, I would hold this tall spear,<br>
 And bony though he be, I would mount my horse and ride<br>
 Neck by neck with the swiftest."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>These were not vain words; you have come valiantly. But know that this levy of men was made to this purpose: to test the issue of your words whether they were spoken false or true; and to hear the suits of all those that have obeyed my summons, that if any among them have suffered injury, his wrongs may be righted.</p>
 <p>And first in the case of Tsuneyo, I make judgment. To him shall be returned his lawful estate, thirty parishes in the land of Sano.</p>
 <p>But above all else one thing shall never be forgotten, that in the great snowstorm he cut down his trees, his treasure, and burnt them for firewood. And now in gratitude for the three trees of that time--plum, cherry and pine,--we grant to him three fiefs, Plumfield in Kaga, Cherrywell in Etchū and Pine-branch in Kōzuke.</p>
 <p>He shall hold them as a perpetual inheritance for himself and for his heirs; in testimony whereof we give this title-deed, by our own hand signed and sealed, together with the safe possession of his former lands.</p></dir>

 <p>He took the deeds, thrice bowing his head.</p></dir>

 <p>"Look, all you barons! (TSUNEYO <i>holds up the documents</i>.)<br>
 Look upon this sight<br>
 And scorn to envy turn!"<br>
 Then the levies of all the lands<br>
 Took leave of their Lord<br>
 And went their homeward way.</p></dir>

 <p>TSUNEYO.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And among them Tsuneyo</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Among them Tsuneyo,<br>
 Joy breaking on his brow,<br>
 Rides now on splendid steed<br>
 To the Boat-bridge of Sano, to his lands once torn<br>
 Pitiless from him as the torrent tears<br>
 That Bridge of Boats at Sano now his own.</p>
