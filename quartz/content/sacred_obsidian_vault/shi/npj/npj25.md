 <p>COURTIER.</p>
 <p>I am a courtier in the service of the Emperor Shujaku. You must know that the Prime Minister's daughter, Princess Aoi, has fallen sick. We have sent for abbots and high-priests, of the Greater School and of the Secret School, but they could not cure her.</p>
 <p>And now, here at my side, stands the witch of Teruhi, <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">1</font></a> a famous diviner with the bow-string. My lord has been told that by twanging her bow-string she can make visible an evil spirit and tell if it be the spirit of a living man or a dead. So he bade me send for her and let her pluck her string. (Turning to the WITCH, who has been waiting motionless.) Come, sorceress, we are ready!</p>

 <p>In the Three Coaches<br>
 That travel on the Road of Law<br>
 I drove out of the Burning House . . . <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Is there no way to banish the broken coach<br>
 That stands at Yūgao's door? <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
                                         This world<br>
 Is like the wheels of the little ox-cart;<br>
 Round and round they go . . . till vengeance comes.<br>
 The Wheel of Life-turns like the wheel of a coach;<br>
 There is no escape from the Six Paths and Four Births.<br>
 We are brittle as the leaves of the <i>bashō</i>;<br>
 As fleeting as foam upon the sea.<br>
 Yesterday's flower, to-day's dream.<br>
 From such a dream were it not wiser to wake?<br>
 And when to this is added another's scorn<br>
 How can the heart have rest?<br>
 So when I heard the twanging of your bow<br>
 For a little while, I thought, I will take my pleasure;<br>
 And as an angry ghost appeared.<br>
 Oh! I am ashamed!</p></dir>

 In a closed coach.<br>
 Though I sat till dawn and watched the moon,<br>
 Till dawn and watched,<br>
 How could I show myself,<br>
 That am no more than the mists that tremble over the fields?<br>
 I am come, I am come to the notch of your bow<br>
 To tell my sorrow.<br>
 Whence came the noise of the bow-string?</p></dir>

 <p>How strange! I see a fine lady whom I do not know riding in a broken coach. She clutches at the shafts of another coach from which the oxen have been unyoked. And in the second coach sits one who seems a new wife. <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">3</font></a> The lady of the broken coach is weeping, weeping. It is a piteous sight.</p>

     None is worth hating and none worth pitying.<br>
     This I knew. Oh when did folly master me?<br>
 You would know who I am that have come drawn by the twanging of your bow? I am the angry ghost of Rokujō, Lady of the Chamber.<br>
     Long ago I lived in the world.<br>
     I sat at flower-feasts among the clouds. <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">5</font></a> <a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a><br>
 On spring mornings I rode out<br>
 In royal retinue and on autumn nights<br>
 Among the red leaves of the Rishis' Cave<br>
 I sported with moonbeams,<br>
 With colours and perfumes<br>
 My senses sated.<br>
   I had splendour then;<br>
 But now I wither like the Morning Glory<br>
 Whose span endures not from dawn to midday.<br>
 I have come to clear my hate.</p><dir>

 I tremble and am ashamed.</p></dir>

So Buddha, by partial truth, lures men from the "burning house" of their material lives.
