 <p>PERSONS</p>
 <i></i><p>THE PRIEST RENSEI (formerly the warrior Kumagai).<br>
 A YOUNG REAPER, who turns out to be the ghost of Atsumori.<br>
 HIS COMPANION.<br>
 CHORUS.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Life is a lying dream, he only wakes<br>
 Who casts the World aside.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I am Kumagai no Naozane, a man of the country of Musashi. I have left my home and call myself the priest Rensei; this I have done because of my grief at the death of Atsumori, who fell in battle by my hand. Hence it comes that I am dressed in priestly guise.</p>
 <p>And now I am going down to Ichi-no-Tani to pray for the salvation of Atsumori's soul.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 <dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>(<i>He walks slowly across the stage, singing a song descriptive of his journey</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 </dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I have come so fast that here I am already at Ichi-no-Tani, in the country of Tsu.</p>
 <p>Truly the past returns to my mind as though it were a thing of to-day.</p>
 <p>But listen! I hear the sound of a flute coming from a knoll of rising ground. I will wait here till the flute-player passes, and ask him to tell me the story of this place.</p>
 <p>REAPERS (<i>together</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>To the music of the reaper's flute<br>
 No song is sung<br>
 But the sighing of wind in the fields.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YOUNG REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>They that were reaping,<br>
 Reaping on that hill,<a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a><br>
 Walk now through the fields<br>
 Homeward, for it is dusk.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPERS (<i>together</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Short is the way that leads <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 From the sea of Suma back to my home.<br>
 This little journey, up to the hill<br>
 And down to the shore again, and up to the hill,--<br>
 This is my life, and the sum of hateful tasks.<br>
 If one should ask me<br>
 I too <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">2</font></a> would answer<br>
 That on the shores of Suma<br>
 I live in sadness.<br>
 Yet if any guessed my name,<br>
 Then might I too have friends.<br>
 But now from my deep misery<br>
 Even those that were dearest<br>
 Are grown estranged. Here must I dwell abandoned<br>
 To one thought's anguish:<br>
 That I must dwell here.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Hey, you reapers! I have a question to ask you.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YOUNG REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Is it to us you are speaking? What do you wish to know?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Was it one of you who was playing on the flute just now?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YOUNG REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yes, it was we who were playing.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>It was a pleasant sound, and all the pleasanter because one does not look for such music from men of your condition.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YOUNG REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Unlocked for from men of our condition, you say! Have you not read:--</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Do not envy what is above you<br>
 Nor despise what is below you"?<br>
 Moreover the songs of woodmen and the flute-playing of herdsmen,<br>
 Flute-playing even of reapers and songs of wood-fellers<br>
 Through poets' verses are known to all the world.<br>
 Wonder not to hear among us<br>
 The sound of a bamboo-flute.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>You are right. Indeed it is as you have told me.<br>
 Songs of woodmen and flute-playing of herdsmen . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPER.</p>
 <p>Flute-playing of reapers . . .</p>
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Songs of wood-fellers</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPERS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Guide us on our passage through this sad world.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Song . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And dance</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And the flute . . .</p>
 <p>And music of many instruments . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPER.</p>
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>These are the pastimes that each chooses to his taste.<br>
 Of floating bamboo-wood<br>
 Many are the famous flutes that have been made;<br>
 Little-Branch and Cicada-Cage,<br>
 And as for the reaper's flute,<br>
 Its name is Green-leaf;<br>
 On the shore of Sumiyoshi<br>
 The Corean flute they play.<a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a><br>
 And here on the shore of Suma<br>
 On Stick of the Salt-kilns<br>
 The fishers blow their tune.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>How strange it is! The other reapers have all gone home, but you alone stay loitering here. How is that?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>How is it, you ask? I am seeking for a prayer in the voice of the evening waves. Perhaps you will pray the Ten Prayers for me?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I can easily pray the Ten Prayers for you, if you will tell me who you are.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>REAPER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>To tell you the truth--I am one of the family of Lord Atsumori.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>One of Atsumori's family? How glad I am!<br>
 Then the priest joined his hands (<i>he kneels down</i>) and prayed:--</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">NAMU AMIDABU.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Praise to Amida Buddha!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"If I attain to Buddhahood,<br>
 In the whole world and its ten spheres<br>
 Of all that dwell here none shall call on my name<br>
 And be rejected or cast aside."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 </dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 <dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Oh, reject me not!<br>
 One cry suffices for salvation,<br>
 Yet day and night<br>
 Your prayers will rise for me.<br>
 Happy am I, for though you know not my name,<br>
 Yet for my soul's deliverance<br>
 At dawn and dusk henceforward I know that you will pray."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>So he spoke. Then vanished and was seen no more.</p>
 <p>(<i>Here follows the Interlude between the two Acts, in which a recitation concerning Atsumori's death takes place. These</i> <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a> <i>interludes are subject to variation and are not considered part of the literary text of the play</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Since this is so, I will perform all night the rites of prayer for the dead, and calling upon Amida's name will pray again for the salvation of Atsumori.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>The ghost of</i> ATSUMORI<i> appears, dressed as a young warrior</i>.)</p>
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Would you know who I am<br>
 That like the watchmen at Suma Pass<br>
 Have wakened at the cry of sea-birds roaming<br>
 Upon Awaji shore?<br>
 Listen, Rensei. I am Atsumori.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>How strange! All this while I have never stopped beating my gong and performing the rites of the Law. I cannot for a moment have dozed, yet I thought that Atsumori was standing before me. Surely it was a dream.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Why need it be a dream? It is to clear the karma of my waking life that I am come here in visible form before you.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Is it not written that one prayer will wipe away ten thousand sins? Ceaselessly I have performed the ritual of the Holy Name that clears all sin away. After such prayers, what evil can be left? Though you should be sunk in sin as deep . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>As the sea by a rocky shore,<br>
 Yet should I be salved by prayer.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And that my prayers should save you . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>This too must spring <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a><br>
 From kindness of a former life. <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1</font></a></p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Once enemies . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>But now . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>In truth may we be named . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Friends in Buddha's Law.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>There is a saying, "Put away from you a wicked friend; summon to your side a virtuous enemy." For you it was said, and you have proven it true.</p>
 <p>And now come tell with us the tale of your confession, while the night is still dark.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>He <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">2</font></a> bids the flowers of Spring<br>
 Mount the tree-top that men may raise their eyes<br>
 And walk on upward paths;<br>
 He bids the moon in autumn waves be drowned<br>
 In token that he visits laggard men<br>
 And leads them out from valleys of despair.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Now the clan of Taira, building wall to wall,<br>
 Spread over the earth like the leafy branches of a great tree:</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yet their prosperity lasted but for a day;<br>
 It was like the flower of the convolvulus.<br>
 There was none to tell them <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">3</font></a> <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>
 <p>That glory flashes like sparks from flint-stone,<br>
 And after,--darkness.<br>
 Oh wretched, the life of men!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>When they were on high they afflicted the humble;<br>
 When they were rich they were reckless in pride.<br>
 And so for twenty years and more<br>
 They ruled this land.<br>
 But truly a generation passes like the space of a dream.<br>
 The leaves of the autumn of Juyei <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Were tossed by the four winds;<br>
 Scattered, scattered (like leaves too) floated their ships.<br>
 And they, asleep on the heaving sea, not even in dream<br>
 Went back to home.<br>
 Caged birds longing for the clouds,--<br>
 Wild geese were they rather, whose ranks are broken<br>
 As they fly to southward on their doubtful journey.<br>
 So days and months went by; Spring came again<br>
 And for a little while<br>
 Here dwelt they on the shore of Suma<br>
 At the first valley. <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 From the mountain behind us the winds blew down<br>
 Till the fields grew wintry again.<br>
 Our ships lay by the shore, where night and day<br>
 The sea-gulls cried and salt waves washed on our sleeves.<br>
 We slept with fishers in their buts<br>
 On pillows of sand.<br>
 We knew none but the people of Suma.<br>
 And when among the pine-trees<br>
 The evening smoke was rising,<br>
 Brushwood, as they call it, <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 Brushwood we gathered<br>
 And spread for carpet.<br>
 Sorrowful we lived<br>
 On the wild shore of Suma,<br>
 Till the clan Taira and all its princes<br>
 Were but villagers of Suma.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>

 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>But on the night of the sixth day of the second month<br>
 My father Tsunemori gathered us together.<br>
 "To-morrow," he said, "we shall fight our last fight.<br>
 To-night is all that is left us."<br>
 We sang songs together, and danced.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yes, I remember; we in our siege-camp<br>
 Heard the sound of music<br>
 Echoing from your tents that night,;<br>
 There was the music of a flute . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The bamboo-flute! I wore it when I died.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>We heard the singing . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Songs and ballads . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Many voices</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Singing to one measure.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(ATSUMORI <i>dances</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>First comes the Royal Boat.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The whole clan has put its boats to sea.<br>
 He <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">1</font></a> will not be left behind;<br>
 He runs to the shore.<br>
 But the Royal Boat and the soldiers' boats<br>
 Have sailed far away.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>ATSUMORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>What can he do? <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a><br>
 He spurs his horse into the waves.<br>
 He is full of perplexity. And then</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>He looks behind him and sees<br>
 That Kumagai pursues him;<br>
 He cannot escape.<br>
 Then Atsumori turns his horse<br>
 Knee-deep in the lashing waves,<br>
 And draws his sword.<br>
 Twice, three times he strikes; then, still saddled,<br>
 In close fight they twine; roll headlong together<br>
 Among the surf of the shore.<br>
 So Atsumori fell and was slain, but now the Wheel of Fate<br>
 Has turned and brought him back.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>(ATSUMORI <i>rises from the ground and advances toward the</i> PRIEST <i>with uplifted sword</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"There is my enemy," he cries, and would strike,<br>
 But the other is grown gentle<br>
 And calling on Buddha's name<br>
 Has obtained salvation for his foe;<br>
 So that they shall be re-born together<br>
 On one lotus-seat.<br>
 "No, Rensei is not my enemy.<br>
 Pray for me again, oh pray for me again."</p></dir>
