 <p align="center">(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Namino-Hana</span>)</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Yasuhide</span></p>  
 <p>The wild flowers fade, the maple-leaves,<br> Touched by frost-fingers, float to earth;<br> But on the bosom of the sea,<br> The flowers to which her waves give birth<br> Fade not, like blossoms of the land,<br> Nor feel the chill of Autumn's hand.</p>  <h3 align="center">POVERTY</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Ransetsu</span></p>  
 <p>On a cold, snowy morning,<br> Somebody's child picking up,<br> With stiff, chilled fingers,<br> Empty tins in the street.</p>  <h3 align="center">ISOLATION</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Isé</span></p>  
 <p>Cold as the wind of early Spring,<br> Chilling the buds that still lie sheathed <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></a><br> In their brown armour, with its sting<br> And the bare branches withering—<br>   So seems the human heart to me!<br>   Cold as the March wind's bitterness;<br>   I am alone, none comes to see<br>   Or cheer me in these days of stress.</p>  <h3 align="center">SPRING DAYS AND BLOSSOM</h3>  
 <p>When the Spring comes, in all green things that grow<br> New pulse of Life beats warmly, all aglow,<br> Long are the golden days.<br> Fragrant and moist the gentle zephyrs blow<br> Through the warm haze.<br> Why should the flowers alone make haste to go,<br> Swift to depart from us, who love them so?</p>  <h3 align="center">OVER THE FENCE</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Isé</span></p>  
 <p>In summer-time awhile the breeze will bring<br> Over the fence a drift of petals fair,<br> From the next garden's cherry blossoming;<br> I would that rather the strong wind would bear<br> The tree itself in fragrant beauty there<br>           Into my garden</p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">PASSING OF THE SPRING</h3>  
 <p>I know all blooms must wither at the last—<br> Fair is their life, but limited and brief;<br> Yet when I see their fragile beauty past,<br> Filled is my heart with an unreasoning grief,<br> Through the unchanging pageant of the years<br> The passing of the Spring is sad to tears!</p>  <h3 align="center">FADED HUES</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Motoyoshi no Mikō</span></p>  
 <p>Fair and unchanged in hue the flowers appear,<br> As in last Springtime, exquisite to see,<br> But one with whom I saw them bloom last year<br>          Hath changed to me!</p>  <h3 align="center">THE FROGS CROAKING</h3>  
 <p>The croaking frogs that find their lodging here,<br> Would seem to feel the loneliness of night<br> As much as I, so plaintive is their cry<br> Through the long hours until the morning light.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CLOUD OF BLOSSOM</h3>  
 <p>The stranger viewing from afar<br> Yoshino's far-famed cherry-trees,<br> Veiling each mountain crag and scar,<br> A soft white cloud is all he sees!</p>  <h3 align="center">ABSENT</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Sugawara Adaijin</span></p>  
 <p>O cherry-blossom loved so well,<br> If you do not forget your lord,<br> Absent from you this April-time,<br> Send me your fragrant message, stored<br> In the safe keeping of the breeze,<br> Blowing towards me! Flowers adored,<br>           I think of you!</p>  <h3 align="center">HOTOTOGISU—THE CUCKOO</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Sanesada</span></p>  
 <p>     I hear the cuckoo calling,<br> Calling, while the dawn's cold dews are falling,<br>      A lonely lullaby.<br> Yet when my eyes would seek her,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nought can my gaze descry<br> But grey mists fainter growing,<br> But white moon ghostly showing<br> Pale in the morning sky!</p>  <h3 align="center">HOTOTOGISU</h3>  
 <p>None but the waning moon of morn<br> Heard the Hototogisu's cry<br> In anguish from her heart's-blood torn<br> Thrill upwards to the paling sky!</p>  <h3 align="center">BROCADE OF AUTUMN</h3>  
 <p>   The Autumn Plain<br> Is robed in rich brocade,<br>    With flowered pattern<br> Lavishly displayed.<br>    Whence come those dyes<br> Of variegated hue?<br>    Since crystal clear<br> And colourless the dew?</p>
