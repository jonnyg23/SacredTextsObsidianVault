 <p>THIS waterfall's melodious voice<br>   Was famed both far and near;<br> Although it long has ceased to flow,<br>   Yet still with memory's ear<br>   Its gentle splash I hear.</p></div>  
 <p><small>This poet was the father of the writer of verse No. <a href="hvj065.htm#page_64">64</a>, and was a member of the Fujiwara family at the zenith of their power; he was a great statesman and scholar, and died in the year 1041. The verse was written in praise of a waterfall that had been made by the orders of the Emperor Saga early in the ninth century, but which had by this time ceased to exist; and the illustration well shows the watercourse now run dry.</small></p>
