 <p>A monk or a nun being pressed by nature should, in case they have not their own broom, beg for that of a fellow-ascetic. A monk or a nun, seeing that the ground is infected by eggs or living beings, &amp;c., should not ease nature on such an unfit ground. But if the ground is free from eggs or living beings, &amp;c., then they may ease nature on such a ground. (1)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun, knowing that the householder with regard to such a place for the sake of one or many, male or female fellow-ascetics, for the sake of many <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as or Brâhma<i>n</i>as whom he has well counted, kills living beings and commits various sins, should not ease nature on such a place or any other of the same sort, whether that place be appropriated by another person or not <a name="fr_466"></a><a href="#fn_460"><font size="1">3</font></a>, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 1, § 13). (2 and 3).</p>
