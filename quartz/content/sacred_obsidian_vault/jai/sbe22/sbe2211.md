 <p>A wise man should remove any aversion (to control <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">3</font></a>); he will be liberated in the proper time. Some, following wrong instruction, turn away (from control). They are dull, wrapped in delusion. While they imitate the life of monks, (saying), 'We shall be free from attachment,' they enjoy the pleasures that offer themselves <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Through wrong instruction the (would-be) sages trouble themselves (for pleasures); thus they sink deeper and deeper in delusion, (and cannot get) to this, nor to the opposite shore <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">5</font></a>. Those who are freed (from attachment to the world and its pleasures), reach the opposite shore <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">6</font></a>. Subduing desire by desirelessness, he does not enjoy the pleasures that offer themselves. Desireless, giving up the world, and ceasing to act, he knows, and sees, and has no wishes because of his discernment <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">7</font></a>; he is called houseless.

 <p>(But on the contrary) he suffers day and night, works in the right and the wrong time, desires wealth and treasures, commits injuries and violent acts, again and again directs his mind upon these injurious doings <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a>; for his own sake, to support or to be supported by his relations, friends, the ancestors, gods, the king, thieves, guests, paupers, <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as. (2)</p>  
 <p>Thus violence is done by these various acts, deliberately, out of fear, because they think 'it is for the expiation of sins <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' or for some other hope. Knowing this, a wise man should neither himself commit violence by such acts, nor order others to commit violence by such acts, nor consent to the violence done by somebody else.</p>  
 <p>This road (to happiness) has been declared by the noble ones, that a clever man should not be defiled (by sin). Thus I say. (3)</p>
