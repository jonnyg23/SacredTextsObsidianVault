 <p>As I have heard it, I shall tell how the Venerable Ascetic, exerting himself and meditating, after having entered the order in that winter, wandered about <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>'I shall not cover myself with that robe <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">2</font></a>,' only in that winter (he used it). He had crossed (the sa<i>m</i>sâra) for the rest of his life. This (refusing of dress) is in accordance with his doctrine. (1)</p>  
 <p>More than four months many sorts of living beings gathered on his body, crawled about it, and caused pain there. (2)</p>  
 <p>For a year and a month he did not leave off his robe. Since that time the Venerable One, giving up his robe, was a naked, world-relinquishing, houseless (sage) <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (3)</p>  
 <p>Then he meditated (walking) with his eye fixed on a square space before him of the length of a</p>  
 <p>

 <p>man <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Many people assembled, shocked at the sight; they struck him and cried. (4)</p>  
 <p>Knowing (and renouncing) the female sex in mixed gathering places <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he meditated, finding his way himself: I do not lead a worldly life. (5)</p>  
 <p>Giving up the company <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">3</font></a> of all householders whomsoever, he meditated. Asked, he gave no answer; he went, and did not transgress the right path. (6)</p>  
 <p>For some it is not easy (to do what he did), not to answer those who salute; he was beaten with sticks, and struck by sinful people. (7)</p>  
 <p>Disregarding slights difficult to bear, the Sage wandered about, (not attracted) by story-tellers, pantomimes, songs, fights at quarter-staff, and boxing-matches. (8)</p>  
 <p>At that time the son of <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i> saw without sorrow (or pleasure) people in mutual conversation. <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra obtained oblivion of these exquisite sorrows. (9)</p>  
 <p>For more than a couple of years he led a religious life without using cold water; he realised singleness, guarded his body, had got intuition, and was calm. (10)</p>  
 <p>Thoroughly knowing the earth-bodies and water-bodies and fire-bodies and wind-bodies, the lichens, seeds, and sprouts, (11)</p>  
 <p>He comprehended that they are, if narrowly</p>

 <p>inspected, imbued with life, and avoided to injure them; he, the great Hero. (12)</p>  
 <p>The immovable (beings) are changed to movable ones, and the movable beings to immovable ones; beings which are born in all states become individually sinners <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a> by their actions. (13)</p>  
 <p>The Venerable One understands thus: he who is under the conditions (of existence) <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that fool suffers pain. Thoroughly knowing (karman), the Venerable One avoids sin. (14)</p>  
 <p>The sage, perceiving the double (karman) <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">3</font></a>, proclaims the incomparable activity <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">4</font></a>, he, the knowing one; knowing the current of worldliness, the current of sinfulness, and the impulse, (15)</p>  
 <p>Practising the sinless abstinence from killing, he did no acts, neither himself nor with the assistance of others; he to whom women were known as the causes of all sinful acts, he saw (the true state of the world). (16)</p>  
 <p>He did not use what had expressly been prepared for him <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">5</font></a>; he well saw (that bondage comes) through action. Whatever is sinful, the Venerable One left that undone: he consumed clean food. (17)</p>  
 <p>He did not use another's robe, nor does he eat out of another's vessel. Disregarding contempt, he went with indifference to places where food was prepared. (18)</p>  
 <p>Knowing measure in eating and drinking, he was not desirous of delicious food, nor had he a longing for it. A sage should not rub his eyes nor scratch his body. (19)</p>

 <p>Looking a little sideward, looking a little behind, answering little when spoken to, he should walk attentively looking on his path. (20)</p>  
 <p>When the cold season has half-way advanced, the houseless, leaving off his robe and stretching out his arms, should wander about, not leaning against a trunk. (21)</p>  
 <p>This is the rule which has often been followed by the wise Brâhma<i>n</i>a, the Venerable One, who is free from attachment: thus proceed (the monks).</p>  
 <p>Thus I say. (22)</p>
