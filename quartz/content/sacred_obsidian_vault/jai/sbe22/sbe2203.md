 <p>O long-lived (<i>G</i>ambûsvâmin <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">4</font></a>)! I (Sudharman) have heard the following discourse from the venerable (Mahâvîra): (1)</p>  
 <p>Here many do not remember whether they have descended in an eastern direction (when they were born in this world), or in a southern, or in a western, or in a northern direction, or in the direction from above, or in the direction from below, or in a direction intermediate (between the cardinal points), or in a direction intermediate between these (and the</p>

 <p>cardinal points). (2) Similarly, some do not know whether their soul is born again and again or not; nor what they were formerly, nor what they will become after having died and left this world. (3) Now this is what one should know, either by one's own knowledge or through the instruction of the highest (i.e. a Tîrthakara), or having heard it from others: that he descended in an eastern direction, or in any other direction (particularised above). Similarly, some know that their soul is born again and again, that it arrives in this or that direction, whatever direction that may be. (4) He believes in soul <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">1</font></a>, believes in the world <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">2</font></a>, believes in reward <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">3</font></a>, believes in action (acknowledged to be our own doing in such judgments as these): 'I did it;' 'I shall cause another to do it;' 'I shall allow another to do it <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' In the world, these are all the causes of sin <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">5</font></a>, which must be comprehended and renounced. (5) A man that does not comprehend and renounce the causes of sin, descends in a cardinal or intermediate direction, wanders to all cardinal or intermediate directions, is born again and again in manifold births, experiences all painful feelings. (6) About this the Revered One has taught</p>

 <p>the truth (comprehension and renunciation). For the sake of the splendour, honour, and glory of this life, for the sake of birth, death, and final liberation, for the removal of pain, all these causes of sin are at work, which are to be comprehended and renounced in this world. He who, in the world, comprehends and renounces these causes of sin, is called a reward-knowing sage (mu<i>n</i>i). Thus I say <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">1</font></a>.

The first lecture is called sattha-pari<i>n</i><i>n</i>â (<i>s</i>astra-pari<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>â),'knowledge of the weapon.' Weapons are divided into material weapon and weapon consisting in a state (bhâva). The latter is explained to be non-control (asa<i>m</i>yama) or the wrong use of mind, speech, and body. Knowledge (pari<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>â) is twofold: comprehension and renunciation. The subject of the first lecture is, therefore, the comprehension and renunciation of everything that hurts other beings.</p>
