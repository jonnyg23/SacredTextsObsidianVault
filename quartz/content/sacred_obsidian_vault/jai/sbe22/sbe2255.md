 <p>In the east or west or south or north, there are some faithful householders, &amp;c., (all down to) servants who will speak thus: 'It is not meet that these illustrious, pious, virtuous, eloquent, restrained, controlled, chaste ascetics, who have ceased from sensual intercourse, should eat or drink food, &amp;c., which is âdhâkarmika <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_368"><font size="1">1</font></a>; let us give to the ascetics all food, &amp;c., that is ready for our use, and let us, afterwards, prepare food for our own use.' Having heard such talk, the mendicant should not accept such-like food, &amp;c., for it is impure and unacceptable. (1)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour or in their residence or on a pilgrimage from village to village, who know that in a village or scot-free town, &amp;c., dwell a mendicant's nearer or remoter relations--viz. a householder or his wife, &amp;c.--should not enter or leave such houses for the sake of food or drink. The Kevalin says: This is the reason: Seeing him, the other might, for his sake, procure or prepare food, &amp;c. Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &amp;c., that he should not enter or leave such houses for the sake of food or drink.</p>  
 <p>Knowing this, he should go apart and stay where no people pass or see him. In due time he may enter other houses, and having begged for alms which are acceptable and given out of respect for</p>

 <p>his cloth, he may eat his dinner. If the other has, on the mendicant's timely entrance, procured or prepared food, &amp;c., which is âdhâkarmika, he might silently examine it, and think: 'Why should I abstain from what has been brought.' As this would be sinful, he should not do so. But after consideration he should say: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) as it is not meet that I should eat or drink food, &amp;c., which is âdhâkarmika, do not procure or prepare it.' If after these words the other brings and gives him âdhâkarmika food which he has prepared, he should not accept such-like food, &amp;c., for it is impure and unacceptable. (2)</p>  
 <p>When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour sees that meat or fish is being roasted, or oil cakes, for the sake of a guest, are being prepared, they should not, quickly approaching, address the householder; likewise if the food is prepared for the sake of a sick person. (3)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour might, of the received quantity of food, eat only the sweet-smelling parts and reject the bad-smelling ones. As this would be sinful, they should not do so; but they should consume everything, whether it be sweet smelling or bad smelling, and reject nothing. (4)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour might, of the received quantity of drink, imbibe only the well-flavoured part, and reject the astringent part. As this would be sinful, they should not do so; but they should consume everything, whether it be well flavoured or astringent, and reject nothing. (5)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun, having received a more than sufficient quantity of food, might reject (the superfluous part) without having considered or consulted</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>fellow-ascetics living in the neighbourhood, who follow the same rules of conduct, are agreeable and not to be shunned; as this would be sinful, they should not do so. Knowing this, they should go there and after consideration say: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as! this food, &amp;c., is too much for me, eat it or drink it!' After these words the other might say: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! we shall eat or drink as much of this food or drink as we require; or, we require the whole, we shall eat or drink the whole.' (6)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &amp;c., which for the sake of another has been put before the door, if the householder has not permitted him to do so, or he gives it him; for such food, &amp;c. But on the contrary he may accept it.</p>  
 <p>This is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>Thus I say. (7)</p>
