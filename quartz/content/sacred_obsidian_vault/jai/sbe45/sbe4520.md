 <p>In the town of Kâmpilya there was a king, named Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya, who possessed numerous troops and war-chariots; once he went a-hunting. (1)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>He was surrounded on all sides by a large host of horses, elephants, chariots, and footmen. (2)</p>  
 <p>He chased the deer on horseback in the Kêsara-park of Kâmpilya; and intent on his sport he killed there the frightened deer. (3)</p>  
 <p>Now in the Kêsara-park there was a houseless ascetic intent on sacred study and meditating on the Law. (4)</p>  
 <p>Annihilating sinful inclinations <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he meditated in the Asphôta-bower <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">2</font></a>. But the king killed the deer that fled to him. (5)</p>  
 <p>Now the king on horseback came quickly there; he saw the killed deer and saw the monk there. (6)</p>  
 <p>The king in his consternation (thought) 'I had nearly hurt the monk; ill-fated and cruel me that is mad for the sport.' (7)</p>  
 <p>Having dismissed his horse, the king bowed respectfully to the monk's feet (saying), 'Forgive me this, Reverend sir.' (8)</p>  
 <p>But the venerable monk, being plunged in silent meditation, made no reply to the king, who, therefore, was seized with fear. (9)</p>  
 <p>'I am Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya; answer me, Reverend sir; a monk might by the fire of his wrath reduce millions of men to ashes.' (10)</p>  
 <p>'Be without fear, O king; but grant safety to others also; in this transient world of living beings, why are you addicted to cruelty? (11)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>'As you must, of necessity, one day part with everything, in this transient world of living beings, why do you cling to kingly power? (12)</p>  
 <p>'Transient like a stroke of lightning are life and beauty, which you love so much; you do not comprehend what will benefit you in the next life. (13)</p>  
 <p>'Wives and children, friends and relations, all are dependent on a man during his life; but they will not follow him in death. (14)</p>  
 <p>'The sons, in great sorrow, will remove the corpse of their father (to the cemetery); and so will parents do with their sons and relations; O king, do penance! (15)</p>  
 <p>'O king, other men, glad, and pleased, and well attired, will enjoy the riches (the deceased) had amassed, and will dally with the wives he had so well guarded. (16)</p>  
 <p>'And whatever actions he has done, good or wicked ones, with their Karman he will depart to his next existence.' (17)</p>  
 <p>Then the king was taught the Law by this monk, and was filled with a great desire for purity, and disregard of worldly objects. (18)</p>  
 <p>Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya gave up his kingly power and adopted the faith of the <i>G</i>inas in the presence of the venerable monk Gardabhâli. (19)</p>  
 <p>A Kshattriya, who had abandoned his kingdom and had turned monk, said to him: 'As you look so happy in outward appearance, you must have peace of mind. (20)</p>  
 <p>'What is your name, to which Gôtra do you belong, and why have you become an ascetic <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">1</font></a>?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> How do you venerate the enlightened ones <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_214"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and how did you come to be called a well-behaved (monk)? (21)</p>  
 <p>"My name is Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya; I belong to the Gôtra of Gôtama; my teacher is Gardabhâli, who is conversant with the sacred lore and good conduct. (22)</p>  
 <p>"O great sage, the man of limited knowledge talks foolishly on these four heads <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">2</font></a>, viz. the existence of the soul, its non-existence, idolatry, and the inefficiency of knowledge. (23)</p>  
 <p>"This has been declared by him who is enlightened, wise, liberated, conversant with the sacred lore and good conduct, who is truthful and of right energy. (24)</p>  
 <p>"Men who commit sins will go to hell; but those who have walked the road of righteousness, will obtain a place in heaven. (25)</p>  
 <p>"All this delusive talk (of the heretics) is untrue and without any meaning; I live and walk about according to the rules of self-control. (26)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p>"I know all these heresies to be contemptible; I know that there will be a life hereafter, and I know my Self. (27)</p>  
 <p>"I was an illustrious god in the Mahâprâ<i>n</i>a heaven, and reached old age as we here would say of a man who is a hundred years old; but in heaven, hundred years consist of as many Mahâpâlîs of Pâlîs <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (28)</p>  
 <p>"Descending from the Brahmalôka, I was born as a man. I know exactly the length of my life as well as that of other men. (29)</p>  
 <p>"A monk should abandon the manifold doctrines (of heretics), and his own fancies, and such deeds as are productive of evil everywhere. One should live up to this wisdom <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (30)</p>  
 <p>"I keep clear of the (superstitious) questions and the spells of laymen, exerting myself day and night (in the true religion). Thinking thus, one should practise austerities. (31)</p>  
 <p>"And what you of a pure mind asked me just now, that has been revealed by the enlightened one <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">3</font></a>; such knowledge makes part of the creed of the <i>G</i>inas. (32)</p>  
 <p>"A wise man believes in the existence of the soul <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">4</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>he avoids the heresy of the non-existence of the soul; possessing true faith one should practise the very difficult Law according to the faith. (33)</p>  
 <p>"Having learned this pure creed, which is adorned by truth and righteousness, Bharata <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">1</font></a> gave up Bharatavarsha and all pleasures, and entered the order. (34)</p>  
 <p>"King Sagara <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">2</font></a> also gave up the ocean-girt Bharatavarsha and his unrivalled kingly power, and reached perfection through his compassion. (35)</p>  
 <p>"After having given up Bharatavarsha, the famous universal monarch of great power, called Maghavan <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">3</font></a>, entered the order. (36)</p>  
 <p>"King Sanatkumâra <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">4</font></a>, a universal monarch of great power, placed his son on the throne, and then practised austerities. (37)</p>

 <p>bringer of peace to the world, gave up Bharatavarsha and reached perfection. (38)</p>  
 <p>"King Kunthu, the bull of the Aikshvâka race, the widely famed lord, reached perfection. (39)</p>  
 <p>"King Ara, after he had given up the sea-girt Bharatavarsha, reached perfection on becoming exempt from defilement. (40)</p>  
 <p>"After having given up his large kingdom, his army and war-chariots, his exquisite pleasures, Mahâpadma <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">1</font></a> practised austerities. (41)</p>  
 <p>"Having brought the (whole) earth under his sceptre, king Harishê<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who humbled the pride (of other kings), reached perfection. (42)</p>  
 <p>"<i>G</i>aya <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">3</font></a>, together with thousands of kings, renouncing the world, practised self-restraint. He</p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>reached perfection which has been taught by the <i>G</i>inas. (43)</p>  
 <p>"Da<i>s</i>âr<i>n</i>abhadra <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">1</font></a>, giving up his flourishing kingdom of Dasâr<i>n</i>a, turned monk; he renounced the world, being directed to do so by <i>S</i>akra himself. (44)</p>  
 <p>"Karaka<i>n</i><i>d</i>u was king of Kaliṅga; Dvimukha, of Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âla; Nami, of Vidêha; Naggati (or rather Nagna<i>g</i>it), of Gândhâra <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (45)</p>  
 <p>"Nami humbled himself, being directed to do so by Sakra himself; the king of Vidêha left the house and became a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (46)</p>  
 <p>"These bulls of kings have adopted the faith of the <i>G</i>inas; after having placed their sons on the throne, they exerted themselves as <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as. (47)</p>  
 <p>"Udâya<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the bull of the kings of Sauvîra, renounced the world and turned monk; he entered the order and reached perfection. (48)</p>  
 <p>"And thus the king of Kâ<i>s</i>i <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_231"><font size="1">4</font></a>, exerting himself for the best truth, abandoned all pleasures, and hewed down, as it were, his Karman like a forest. (49)</p>  
 <p>"And thus king Vi<i>g</i>aya <a name="fr_233"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">5</font></a>, whose sins were not quite annihilated <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">6</font></a>, turned monk after he, the famous man, had quitted his excellent kingdom. (50)</p>

 <p>"And thus the royal seer Mahâbala <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_234"><font size="1">1</font></a> practised severe penance with an undistracted mind, and took upon himself the glory (of self-control). (51)</p>  
 <p>"Why should a wise man, for bad reasons, live on earth like a madman, since those persons (mentioned above) who reached eminence, exerted themselves strongly? (52)</p>  
 <p>"I have spoken true words able to promote virtue; some have been saved, some are being saved, and some will be saved. (53)</p>  
 <p>"Why should a wise man, for bad reasons, bring affliction upon himself? He who has become free from all ties and sins, will reach perfection." (54)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_210"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_211">80:4</a> The commentators Sanskritise this name in Sa<i>m</i>yata. But however appropriate it may be to a <i>G</i>aina, it certainly does not <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a> look like a king's name. The Sanskrit form of the name was probably Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya or S<i>ri</i><i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya, both of which frequently occur in Sanskrit literature.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_211"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_212">81:1</a> To render âsrava.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_212"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_213">81:2</a> Apphôva in the original; there are several plants which are called âsphôta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_213"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_214">82:1</a> Literally, a Brahman.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_214"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_215">83:1</a> Buddhê, explained â<i>k</i>âryân, preceptors.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_215"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_216">83:2</a> These are the four great heresies: (1) that of the kriyâvâdinas, who maintain that the soul exists; (2) that of the akriyâvâdinas, who hold the reverse of the preceding doctrine; (3) that of the vainayikas, which seems to be identical with salvation by bhakti; (4) that of the a<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânavâdinas, who contend that knowledge is not necessary for salvation, but t a p a s; this seems identical with the karmapatha. The commentators explain kriyâvâdina<i>h</i> 'those who believe the soul or âtman to be characterised by the verb to be (i.e. by a permanent and unchangeable existence), and ascribe to it such qualities as ubiquity or non-ubiquity, activity or non-activity.' This they treat as heresy, but from Mahâvagga VI, 31, 2 (vol. xvii, p. 109) it is evident that the <i>G</i>ainas were considered kriyâvâdins. The akriyâvâda is also identified with the ksha<i>n</i>ikavâda or doctrine, usually ascribed to Buddhists, that everything has but a momentary existence and is in the next moment replaced by a facsimile of itself. About these heresies compare the Sûtrak<i>ri</i>tâṅga I, 12; II, 2, 77.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_216"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_217">84:1</a> According to the commentary a pâlî seems to be what is commonly called palyôpamâ, and mahâpâlî a sâgarôpamâ. However the longest life of a god in Brahmalôka is but ten Sâgarôpamâs, see below, XXXVI, 225. The construction of the verse is very involved, but the drift of it cannot be mistaken.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_217"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_218">84:2</a> ii vi<i>g</i><i>g</i>âm a<i>n</i>usa<i>m</i><i>k</i>arê. I believe that vi<i>g</i><i>g</i>âm here stands for vidvân, as in the following verse. The meaning would then be, 'knowing this one should live as a monk.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_218"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_219">84:3</a> Buddha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_219"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_220">84:4</a> The <i>G</i>ainas do not deny the existence of the soul, but the unalterable character of the soul. Hence they object to the kriyâvâda.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_221">85:1</a> Bharata was the eldest son of <i>Ri</i>shabha, the first Tîrthakara. He became the first <i>K</i>akravartin, or universal monarch, and resided in Ayôdhyâ. At his renunciation he was ordered by Indra himself to pluck out five handfuls of his hair as is the custom of <i>G</i>aina monks on entering the order.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_221"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_222">85:2</a> Sagara, king of Ayôdhyâ, was, according to the legend contained in the commentary (see R. Fick, Eine jainistische Bearbeitung der Sagara-Sage, Kiel, 1889), the younger brother of A<i>g</i>ita, the second Tîrthakara. He became the second <i>K</i>akravartin, and, in the end, he was ordained by A<i>g</i>ita. The <i>G</i>aina legend seems to be but a strangely distorted version of the story of Sagara told in the first book of the Râmâya<i>n</i>a.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_222"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_223">85:3</a> Maghavan, son of king Samudravi<i>g</i>aya of <i>S</i>râvastî, and his wife Bhadrâ, became the third <i>K</i>akravartin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_223"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_224">85:4</a> Sanatkumâra, son of king A<i>s</i>vasêna of Hastinâpura, and his wife Sahadêvî, became the fourth <i>K</i>akravartin. The adventures of Sanatkumâra are told in a Prâk<i>ri</i>t legend, which I have published in my Ausgewählte Erzählungen in Mâhârâsh<i>t</i>rî, Leipzig, x886, p. 20 ff.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_224"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_225">85:5</a> <i>S</i>ânti was the sixteenth Tîrthakara, Kunthu the seventeenth, and <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a> Ara the eighteenth Tîrthakara. Kunthu sounds strange for a proper name. I think it just possible that it is a popular or Prâk<i>ri</i>t corruption of Kakutstha, who was an Aikshvâka. As is well known, Râma is frequently called after him Kâkutstha, and so are other kings of the same line, in which he stands as the twenty-fifth according to the list in the Râmâya<i>n</i>a I, 70.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_225"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_226">86:1</a> Mahâpadma was the ninth <i>K</i>akravartin. His elder brother was Vish<i>n</i>ukumâra, who was ordained by Suvrata, a disciple of Munisuvrata, the twentieth Tîrthakara. He wrenched the sovereignty of the world from Namu<i>k</i>i, minister of his father Padmôttara, who had ascended the throne, by making him promise as much of his territory as he could cover with three strides. This is the Brahmanical story of Vish<i>n</i>u and Bali, for whom the <i>G</i>ainas have substituted Namu<i>k</i>i. According to them the minister Namu<i>k</i>i was, in a disputation, defeated by the <i>G</i>aina monks, and to revenge himself on them, he ordered them to quit his kingdom as soon as he got it.--Mahâpadma's residence was Hastinâpura.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_226"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_227">86:2</a> Harishê<i>n</i>a, son of king Mahâhari of Kâmpilya, became the tenth <i>K</i>akravartin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_227"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_228">86:3</a> <i>G</i>aya, son of king Samudravi<i>g</i>aya of Râ<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha, became the eleventh <i>K</i>akravartin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_228"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_229">87:1</a> King Da<i>s</i>âr<i>n</i>abhadra was a contemporary of Mahâvîra.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_229"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_230">87:2</a> These are the four Pratyêkabuddhas; see <a href="sbe4510.htm#page_35">p. 35</a>, note <a href="sbe4511.htm#fn_130">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="sbe4520.htm#fr_231">87:3</a> The story of Udâya<i>n</i>a (or perhaps Uddâyana) will be found in my Ausgewählte Erzählungen in Mâhârâsh<i>t</i>rî, p. 28 ff. He was contemporary with Mahâvîra.</p>
