 <p>These (philosophers) who are vanquished (by their passions) cannot help you in cases where a sinner perishes <a name="fr_719"></a><a href="#fn_715"><font size="1">3</font></a>; though having given up their former occupations they will give advice in worldly matters. (1)</p>  
 <p>A wise monk who fully appreciates this, should not mix with those (heretics); without conceit and not attached to them a sage should lead a life equally removed (from love and hate). (2)</p>  
 <p>Some say that those who own possessions and engage in undertakings (may reach perfection); but a monk should take his refuge to those who neither own possessions nor engage in undertakings. (3)</p>  
 <p>A wise man should beg food which has been</p>

 <p>prepared (for somebody else), and he should accept what is freely given him, without greed and passions; he should abstain from overbearing behaviour <a name="fr_720"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (4)</p>  
 <p>He should know the talk of people: some say things which are the outcome of a wrong understanding and are but opinions of others repeated. (5)</p>  
 <p>'The world is boundless and eternal, it exists from eternity and does not perish <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">2</font></a>; (another) bold philosopher <a name="fr_722"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">3</font></a> says that the world is limited, but eternal. (6)</p>  
 <p>'Some say that the knowledge (of the highest authority) is unlimited; but the same bold philosopher says that it is limited in every way <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_719"><font size="1">4</font></a>.' (7)</p>  
 <p>Some beings have motion, others not; it depends on certain conditions whether they are in the one state or in the other. (8)</p>  
 <p>(E. g. big creatures) have one form of bodily existence and then another <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">5</font></a>. But all are subject to pain; hence they should not be killed. (9)</p>  
 <p>This is the quintessence of wisdom: not to kill anything. Know this to be the legitimate conclusion</p>  
 <p>

 <p>from the principle of the reciprocity with regard to non-killing <a name="fr_725"></a><a href="#fn_721"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (10)</p>  
 <p>Living (according to the rules of conduct), and without greed, one should take care of the highest good <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_722"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In walking, in sitting and lying down, and in food and drink: with regard to these three points a monk should always control himself.</p>  
 <p>And he should leave off pride <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">3</font></a>, wrath <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">4</font></a>, deceit <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and greed <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">6</font></a>. (11, 12)</p>  
 <p>Possessing the Samitis and being protected by the five Sa<i>m</i>varas, a pious monk should live, till he reaches perfection, as a man free from fetters among those bound in fetters (viz. the householders). (13)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_715"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_719">246:3</a> A various reading first commented upon by <i>S</i>îlâṅka is: bâlâ pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>itamâ<i>n</i>i<i>n</i>ô, being ignorant men who fancy themselves learned.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_716"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_720">247:1</a> Omâ<i>n</i>a = apamâna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_717"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_721">247:2</a> According to <i>S</i>îlâṅka the eternity of things means, with these philosophers, that one thing always retains the same genus or <i>g</i>âti, e.g. that he who was a man in this life will again be a man in the next.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_718"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_722">247:3</a> According to the commentators Vyâsa is intended. The doctrine referred to in the text is that of the Purâ<i>n</i>as.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_719"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_723">247:4</a> The commentators interpret this verse as if not two philosophical opinions but only one was spoken of. Unlimited knowledge is according to them different from omniscience; in the second part of the sentence 'limited' refers to the sleep of Brahman during which he is unconscious.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_720"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_724">247:5</a> Men are some time embryos, then young men, then old men.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_721"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_725">248:1</a> Ahi<i>m</i>sâsamaya<i>m</i> = ahi<i>m</i>sâsamatâ<i>m</i>, viz. as you do not wish to be killed, so others do not wish to be killed. The last part of the sentence might also be translated: know this to be the real meaning of the Law (samaya) of ahi<i>m</i>sâ. The same verse recurs I, 11, 10.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_722"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_726">248:2</a> Âdâna, right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_723"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_727">248:3</a> Ukkasa = utkarsha, mâna.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_724"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_728">248:4</a> Gala<i>n</i>a = <i>g</i>valana, krôdha.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_725"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_729">248:5</a> Nûma = mâyâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_726"></a><a href="sbe4542.htm#fr_730">248:6</a> Ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>attha = madhyastha, lôbha. Compare the similar expressions in I, 1, 2, 12, above, <a href="sbe4540.htm#page_241">p. 241</a>, notes 1-4, and I, 2, 2, 29, below, <a href="sbe4544.htm#page_257">p. 257</a>.</p>
