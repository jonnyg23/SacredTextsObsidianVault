 <p>There was a Sthavira and Ga<i>n</i>adhara <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_386"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the learned sage Garga. This leader of the Ga<i>n</i>a once made the following reflections: (1)</p>  
 <p>'He who rides in a car, crosses a wilderness; he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>who rides, as it were, in (the car of) religious exercise, crosses the Sa<i>m</i>sâra. (2)</p>  
 <p>'But he who puts bad bullocks <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">1</font></a> before his car, will be tired out with beating them; he will feel vexation, and his goad will be broken (at last). (3)</p>  
 <p>'(A bad bullock) will bite its mate in the tail; it will wound the other <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">2</font></a>; it will break the pin of the yoke <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or it will leave the road. (4)</p>  
 <p>'It will fall down on its side, or sit down, or lie down; it will jump up or caper, or it will obstinately make for a young cow. (5)</p>  
 <p>'It will furiously advance with its head lowered for an attack, or angrily go backward; it will stand still as if dead, or run at full speed. (6)</p>  
 <p>'The cursed beast <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">4</font></a> will rend asunder the rope, or in its unruliness break the yoke; and roaring it will break loose and run off. (7)</p>  
 <p>'Just as bad bullocks are when put before a car, so are bad pupils when yoked, as it were, to the car of the Law; they break down through want of zeal. (8)</p>  
 <p>'Some attach great importance <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">5</font></a> to their success;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>some to their good fare; some to their comfort; some nurse their anger. (9)</p>  
 <p>'Some are averse to begging; some are afraid of insults and are stuck up; (how can) I convince them by reasons and arguments <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">1</font></a> (?) (10)</p>  
 <p>'(A bad pupil) makes objections, and points out (imagined) difficulties; he frequently acts in opposition to the words of the superiors. (11)</p>  
 <p>'(He will say if sent to a lady): "She does not know me, she will give me nothing; I suppose she will be gone out; send some other monk there." (12)</p>  
 <p>'If sent on an errand, they do not do what they were bidden <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but stroll about wherever they like; or deporting themselves like servants of the king <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">3</font></a>, they knit their brows (when speaking to other people). (13)</p>  
 <p>'After they have been instructed, admitted into the order, and nourished with food and drink, they disperse in all directions like geese whose wings have grown.' (14)</p>  
 <p>Now this driver (viz. Garga), who had to deal with bad bullocks, thought: 'What have I to do with bad pupils? I am disheartened. (15)</p>  
 <p>'As are bad pupils, so are bad bullocks; I shall leave these lazy donkeys, and shall practise severe austerities.' (16)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>That noble man, who was full of kindness, grave, and always meditating, wandered about on the earth, leading a virtuous life. (17)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_386"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_387">149:1</a> Ga<i>n</i>a seems to correspond to the modern Ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a; see part i, p. 288, note 2. Ga<i>n</i>adhara, therefore, does not denote here, as usual, a disciple of Tîrthakara.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_387"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_388">150:1</a> Khalu<i>m</i>ka = galiv<i>ri</i>shabha. Gali is explained in the dictionaries: a strong but lazy bull. In verse 16 we meet with galigaddaha = galigardabha, as synonymous with khalu<i>m</i>ka.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_388"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_389">150:2</a> The commentator understands the first line of this verse as having reference to the angry driver. But though an angry driver will perhaps, for all I know, put his bullock's tail to his teeth, still it is harder to supply another subject in the first line than in the second, and in the following verses.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_389"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_390">150:3</a> Samilâ = yugarandhrakîlaka, Ava<i>k</i>ûri.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_390"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_391">150:4</a> <i>Kh</i>imâla = <i>g</i>âra, see Hêma<i>k</i>andra, Dê<i>s</i>î Kôsha 3, 27. It is a coarse term, which I replace by another, though probably the language of our coach-drivers might supply us with a more idiomatic rendering.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_391"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_392">150:5</a> Gârava, cf. <a href="sbe4521.htm#page_98">p. 98</a>, note <a href="sbe4521.htm#fn_257">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_392"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_393">151:1</a> The metre of this verse seems to have originally been Âryâ, but an attempt has been made to change it into Anush<i>t</i>ubh. We meet here with the interesting form a<i>n</i>usâsammî (read a<i>n</i>usasammi) = anu<i>s</i>âsmi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_393"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_394">151:2</a> This seems to be the meaning of the word paliu<i>m</i><i>k</i>anti. The commentators say, after other explanations, that they pretend not to have met the person to whom they were sent.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_394"></a><a href="sbe4529.htm#fr_395">151:3</a> Râ<i>g</i>ave<i>t</i><i>th</i>i<i>m</i> va mannantâ; ve<i>t</i><i>th</i>i = vish<i>t</i>i, hire.</p>
