 <p>A Nirgrantha who has entered the order, who has learned the Law, who has received religious</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>discipline, and who has obtained the benefit of Bôdhi which is difficult to obtain, may perhaps afterwards begin to live as he likes. (1)</p>  
 <p>(He will say:) I have a good bed and wherewithal to cover me; I obtain food and drink; I know everything that comes to pass, friend; why then should I study, sir? (2)</p>  
 <p>He who, after entering the order, always sleeps, eats, and drinks as much as he likes, and lives comfortably, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (3)</p>  
 <p>The sinner who despises the learning and discipline which his preceptor and teachers have taught him, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (4)</p>  
 <p>He who does not, as he should, strive to please his preceptor and teachers, and does not, in his arrogance, treat them with respect, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (5)</p>  
 <p>He who hurts living beings, seeds, and sprouts, who does not control himself, though he believes himself well-controlled, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (6)</p>  
 <p>He who uses a bed, a plank, a chair, a seat, or his duster <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">1</font></a>, without having well wiped these things, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (7)</p>  
 <p>He who walks with great haste and without care, being overbearing and fierce, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (8)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who carelessly inspects things <a name="fr_206"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">1</font></a>, throwing down his duster at random, not being attentive to the inspection of things, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (9)</p>  
 <p>He who carelessly inspects things, his attention being absorbed by what he hears, who always slights his teachers, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (to)</p>  
 <p>He who is deceitful, talkative, arrogant, greedy, who does not control himself, nor share (his food, &amp;c. with those who are in want), and is not of an amiable disposition, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (11)</p>  
 <p>He who is a controversialist, and ill-behaved, who perverts the truth, and delights in quarrels and contentions, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (12)</p>  
 <p>He who sits down on a weak, shaking seat wherever he lists, and is not careful in sitting down, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (13)</p>  
 <p>He who sleeps with dusty feet and does not inspect his couch, being careless about his bed, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (14)</p>  
 <p>He who eats milk, curds, and other things produced from milk, and does not practise austerities, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (15)</p>  
 <p>He who eats after sunset, and when admonished, makes an angry reply, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (16)</p>  
 <p>He who leaves his own teacher, and follows heretical ones, who continuously changes his school <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">2</font></a>, being of a bad disposition, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (17)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>He who has left his own house, and busies himself in another's house, who lives by fortune-telling, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (18)</p>  
 <p>He who eats the food of his relations, and does not like living by alms <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who reposes on the seat of the householder, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (19)</p>  
 <p>Such a monk, who, like the heretics <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">2</font></a>, does not protect himself from sins, who though having the appearance (of a monk) is the lowest among his worthy brethren, is despised in this world like poison; he is nobody in this world and in that beyond. (20)</p>  
 <p>But he who always avoids these sins, and is pious amongst his brethren, is welcomed in this world like nectar; he conquers this world and the next <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (21)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_204"></a><a href="sbe4519.htm#fr_205">78:1</a> Pâdakambala, usually called ra<i>g</i>ôhara<i>n</i>a. One commentator suggests, as a possible rendering, pâtrakambala 'a cloth to cover his almsbowl.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_205"></a><a href="sbe4519.htm#fr_206">79:1</a> It is a monk's duty closely to inspect everything that he uses or comes in contact with, in order to avoid hurting inadvertently anything considered to possess life. This is called pa<i>d</i>ilêhâ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_206"></a><a href="sbe4519.htm#fr_207">79:2</a> Gâ<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>ga<i>n</i>ika, according to the commentators one who attaches himself to another ga<i>n</i>a every half-year.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_207"></a><a href="sbe4519.htm#fr_208">80:1</a> Sâmudâ<i>n</i>iya, explained bhaiksham.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_208"></a><a href="sbe4519.htm#fr_209">80:2</a> Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>aku<i>s</i>îla, literally, those who practise the five wrong <i>s</i>îlas, whereby probably those are denoted who do not keep the five great vows of the <i>G</i>ainas. Note that the Buddhists too have their pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>s</i>îla. They could therefore have been called pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>aku<i>s</i>îla by the <i>G</i>ainas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_209"></a><a href="sbe4519.htm#fr_210">80:3</a> The text is not settled in the last line; but there can be no doubt about the meaning.</p>
