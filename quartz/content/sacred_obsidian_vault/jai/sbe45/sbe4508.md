 <p>All men who are ignorant of the Truth are subject to pain; in the endless Sa<i>m</i>sâra they suffer in many ways. (1)</p>  
 <p>Therefore a wise man, who considers well the ways that lead to bondage <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">3</font></a> and birth, should</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>himself search for the truth, and be kind towards all creatures. (2)</p>  
 <p>'Mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and sons will not be able to help me, when I suffer for my own deeds <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' (3)</p>  
 <p>This truth should be taken to heart <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">2</font></a> by a man of pure faith; he should (therefore) cut off greed and love, and not hanker after his former connections. (4)</p>  
 <p>Cows and horses, jewels and earrings, cattle, slaves and servants: all these (possessions) you must give up in order to obtain the power of changing your form at will. (5) <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>Everything that happens to somebody, affects him personally; therefore, knowing the creatures' love of their own self, do not deprive them of their life, but cease from endangering and combating them. (6)</p>  
 <p>Seeing that to accept (presents) leads to hell, one should not accept even a blade of grass; only to preserve one's life <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">4</font></a> one should eat the food that is put in one's own alms-bowl. (7)</p>  
 <p>Here some are of opinion that they will be delivered from all misery by merely attending the teacher <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">5</font></a>, without abstaining from sins. (8)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>Acknowledging the truth about bondage and liberation, but talking only, not acting (in accordance with these tenets), they seek comfort for themselves in mighty words. (9)</p>  
 <p>Clever talking will not work salvation; how should philosophical instruction do it? Fools, though sinking lower and lower through their sins, believe themselves to be wise men. (to)</p>  
 <p>They are (going) a long way in the endless Sa<i>m</i>sâra; therefore looking out carefully one should wander about carefully <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (11)</p>  
 <p>Choosing what is beyond and above (this world, viz. liberation), one should never desire (worldly objects), but sustain one's body only to be able to annihilate one's Karman. (12)</p>  
 <p>Those will reap pains who, in thoughts, words, or acts, are attached to their body, to colours, and to forms. (13)</p>  
 <p>Recognising the cause of Karman, one should wander about waiting for one's death; (knowing) the permitted quantity of food and drink, one should eat (such food as has been) prepared (by the householders for their own consumption). (14)</p>  
 <p>An ascetic should not lay by any store, not even so little as the grease (sticking to his alms-bowl); but as a bird with its plumage <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">2</font></a>, so he with his alms-bowl should wander about without desires. (15)</p>  
 <p>

 <p>Receiving alms in a manner to avoid faults <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and controlling one's self, one should wander about in a village (&amp;c.) without a fixed residence; careful among the careless one should beg one's food. (16)</p>  
 <p>Thus has spoken the Arhat <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra, the venerable native of Vai<i>s</i>âlî <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">2</font></a>, who possesses the highest knowledge and who possesses the highest faith, who possesses (at the same time) the highest knowledge and the highest faith. (17)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

Kshullaka originally means 'small, young,' but I do not see that the contents of this lecture support this translation, though the commentators would seem to favour it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_105">24:3</a> Dêvêndra here quotes the following Sanskrit verse: Kalatraniga<i>d</i>a<i>m</i> dattvâ na sa<i>m</i>tush<i>t</i>a<i>h</i> pra<i>g</i>âpatih | bhûyô<font size="-1"><sup>ऽ</sup></font>py apatyarûpê<i>n</i>a dadâti gala<i>s</i><i>ri</i>ṅkhalam. The creator was not satisfied when he had given (to man) the wife as a fetter, he added a chain round his neck in the form of children.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_105"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_106">25:1</a> This verse recurs in Sûtrak<i>ri</i>tâṅga I, 9, 5.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_107">25:2</a> Sapêhâê pâsê = svaprêkshayâ pa<i>s</i>yêt, he should look at it with his mind or reflectively. However sapêhâê is usually the absolute participle samprêkshya. The meaning is the same in both cases.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_107"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_108">25:3</a> Some MSS. insert here the following verse: 'Movables and immovables, corn, and furniture can not deliver a man from pain, who is suffering for his deeds.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_108"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_109">25:4</a> This is according to the commentators the meaning of the word dôgu<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>î = <i>g</i>ugupsin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_109"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_110">25:5</a> Âyariya<i>m</i> vidittâ<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>. The commentator makes this out <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a> to mean: by learning only what right conduct (â<i>k</i>ârikam) is, without living up to it. But it is obvious that the author intends a censure upon the <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ânamârga.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_110"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_111">26:1</a> As usual this phrase means: one should conduct one's self so as to commit no sin.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_111"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_112">26:2</a> There is a pun in the original on the word patta, which means plumes (patra) and alms-bowl (pâtra).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_112"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_113">27:1</a> This is the êsha<i>n</i>âsamiti. On the samitis see below, Twelfth Lecture, 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="sbe4508.htm#fr_114">27:2</a> Vêsaliê = Vai<i>s</i>âlîka. See my remarks on this statement in part i, introduction, p. xi, and Hoernle's notes in his translation of the Uvâsaga Dasâo, p. 3 ff.</p>
