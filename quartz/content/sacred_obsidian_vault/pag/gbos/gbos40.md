 <p>[1] Forming Circle. Light candles.</p> 
 <p>1. Draw Circle with Magic Sword or Athame.</p> 
 <p>2. Sprinkle with consecrated water.</p> 
 <p>3. Cense.</p> 
 <p>4. Say, "I conjure thee, O Circle of Power, that thou be a Boundary and a Protection and a meeting place between the world of men and the realms of the Mighty Ones, A Guardian and a Protection that shall preserve and contain the Power which we shall raise within thee, Wherefore do I Bless and Consecrate thee."</p> 
 <p>5. Say "I summon, Stir, and Call Thee up, Ye Mighty Ones of the (East, South, West, North) To witness the Rites and to guard the Circle."</p> 
 <p>[2] Closing Circle.</p> 
 <p>Say, "Mighty Ones of the (East, South, West, North), I thank you for attending, and ere you depart for your lovely realms, I say Hail and Farewell."</p> 
 <p>[3] Consecration of Water and Salt.</p> 
 <p>Touch water with Athame, saying, "I exorcise thee, O Creature of Water, that thou cast out from thee all the impurities and uncleannesses of the spirits of the World of Phantasm, In the names of Aradia and Cernunnos."</p> 
 <p>Touching Salt with Athame, say, "Blessings be upon this creature of Salt. Let all malignity and hindrance be cast forth hencefrom and let all good enter herein. Wherefore I bless thee that thou mayest aid me, In the names of Aradia and Cernunnos."</p> 
 <p>[4] Drawing Down the Moon.</p> 
 <p>"I invoke Thee and call upon Thee, Oh Mighty Mother of us All, Bringer of all Fruitfulness. By Seed and Root, by Stem and Bud, by Leaf and Flower and Fruit, by Life and Love, Do We invoke Thee to descend upon the body of Thy servant and Priestess (name)."</p> 
 <p>High Priest and other men give Fivefold Kiss. Women all bow.</p>
