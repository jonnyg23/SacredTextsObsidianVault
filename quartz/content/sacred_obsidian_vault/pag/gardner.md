 <h1>Books of Gerald Gardner</h1>

 <p>
 Gerald Gardner was the central figure in the
 Wiccan renaissance of the 1950s and 1960s.
 He wrote several key texts of modern Wicca, including
 <a href="gbos/index.htm">the Gardnerian Book of Shadows</a>.</p>

 (1949). This is a novel which is set in Medieval England, based very
 closely on <a href="murray.htm">Margaret Murray's</a> works
 and the magical system described in
 <a href="../grim/kos/index.htm">The Key of Solomon</a>.
 Gardner sold copies of this book at his
 Witchcraft Museum on the Isle of Man.
 The fictional setting was necessitated by the harsh laws 
 against witchcraft which were still on the books as of 1949,
 and (reputedly) secrecy requirements placed on him
 by the traditionalist coven which he had joined.
 Although High Magic's Aid may not
 quite succeed as a historical novel,
 it is quite readble and is a significant document
 in the evolution of modern Wicca.<p>

 (1959)
 (Note: these books are currently out of print, but should be obtainable
 on the used book market).
 These books are non-fictional, popularized recitations of Gardners'
 evolving views on Wicca.
 After the repeal of the witchcraft laws in England in 1951,
 Gardner finally convinced his traditionalist coven to allow him
 to publish some of the details of their previously 
 secret beliefs and practices.
 Or so the story goes; in any case, these are transitional
 books in which Gardner is weaving together the various strands
 of modern Wicca.
 These books created a sensation and Gardner became what amounted to
 the first Wiccan media star.
