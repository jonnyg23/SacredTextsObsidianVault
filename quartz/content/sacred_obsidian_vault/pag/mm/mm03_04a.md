 <h2>Question IV</h2>
 <h3>Of the Quality and Condition of Witnesses</h3></center>
 
 
         
 Note that persons under a sentence of excommunication, associates and 
 accomplices in the crime, notorious evildoers and criminals, or servants 
 giving evidence against their masters, are admitted as witnesses in a case 
 concerning the Faith. And just as a heretic may give evidence against a 
 heretic, so may a witch against a witch; but this only in default of other 
 proofs, and such evidence can only be admitted for the prosecution and not 
 for the defence: this is true also of the evidence of the prisoner's wife, 
 sons and kindred; for the evidence of such has more weight in proving a 
 charge than in disproving it.<br>
 
         
 This is made clear in the c. <i>in fidei de haer.</i>, where it says: As a 
 protection of the faith we allow that in a case of inquiry into the sin of 
 heresy, persons under excommunication and partners and accomplices in the 
 crime shall be admitted as witnesses, in default of other proofs against 
 heretics and their patrons, protectors and defenders; provided that it 
 appears probably both from the number of the witnesses and of those against 
 whom they give evidence, and from other cicumstances, that they are not 
 giving false testimony.<br>
 
         
 The case of evidence given by perjurers, when it is presumed that they are 
 speaking out of zeal for the faith, is deal with in the Canon c. <i>accusatus</i>, 
 § <i>licet</i>, where it says that the evidence of perjurers, after 
 they have repented, is admissable; and it goes on to say: If it manifestly 
 appears that they do not speak in a spirit of levity, or from motives of 
 enmity, or by reason of a bribe, but purely out of zeal for the orthodox 
 faith, wishing to correct what they have said, or to reveal something about 
 which they had kept silence, in defence of the faith, their testimony 
 shell be as valid as that of anyone else, provided that there is no other 
 obection to it.<br>
 
         
 And it is clear from the same chapter of the Canon that the testimony of 
 men or low repute and criminals, and of servants against their masters, is 
 admitted; for it says: So great is the plague of heresy that, in an action 
 involving this crime, even servants are admitted as witnesses against their 
 masters, and any criminal evildoer may give evidence against any person 
 soever.
