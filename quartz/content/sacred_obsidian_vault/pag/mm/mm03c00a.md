 <center><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
 <h2>The Third Head</h2>
 <h3>Which is the last Part of this Work. How the Process is to be Concluded by the Pronouncement of a Definite and Just Sentence</h3></center>
  
  
         HAVING by the grace of God 
 examined the proper means of arriving at a knowledge of the heresy of 
 witchcraft, and having shown how the process on behalf of the faith should be 
 initiated and proceeded with, it remains to discuss how that process is to be 
 brought to a fitting termination with an appropriate sentence.<br> 
 
         
 Here it is to be noted that this heresy, as was shown in the beginning of this 
 Last Part, is not to be confused with other simple heresies, since it is 
 obvious that it is not a pure and single crime, but partly ecclesiastical and 
 partly civil. Therefore in dealing with the methods of passing sentence, we 
 must first consider a certain kind of sentence to which witches are in the 
 habit of appealing, in which the secular judge can act on his own account 
 independently of the Ordinary. Secondly, we shall consider those in which he 
 cannot act without the Ordinary. And so thirdly it will be shown how the 
 Ordinaries can discharge themselves of their duties.
