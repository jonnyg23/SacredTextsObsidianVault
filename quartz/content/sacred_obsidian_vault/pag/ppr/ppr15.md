   <h3 align="center">A PRAYER FOR PRESERVATION OF THE HEART</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Egyptian</i>)</p>  
 <p>MY HEART, my mother; my heart, my mother! My heart of my existence upon earth!</p>  
 <p>May naught stand up to oppose me in judgment; may there be no opposition to me in the presence of the sovereign princes; may no evil be wrought against me in the presence of the gods; may there be no parting of thee from me in the presence of the great god, the lord of Amentet.</p>  
 <p>Homage to thee, O thou heart of Osiris--khent--Amentet! Homage to you, O my reins! Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell in the divine clouds, and who are exalted [or holy] by reason of your sceptres!</p>  
 <p>Speak ye fair words for the Osiris Auf-ankh, and make ye him to prosper before Nehebka. And behold, though I be joined to the earth, and am in the mighty innermost part of heaven, let me remain on the earth and not die in Amentet, and let me remain a <i>khu</i> therein for ever and ever!</p>  
 <p><font size="-1"><dir>This prayer shall be recited over a basalt scarab, which shall be set in a gold setting, and it shall be placed inside the heart of the man (i.e., the dead) for whom the ceremonies of "opening the mouth" and of anointing with unguent have been performed.</dir></font></p>  
 <p>And there shall be recited by way of magical charm the words:</p>  
 <p>"My heart, my mother! my heart, my mother! My heart of transformations!"</p>
