   <h3 align="center">PRAYER TO THE SUN</h3>  
 <p align="center">(<i>Chaldean</i>)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>THE LORD has sent me; the great god Hea, has sent me.<br> Thou, in thy course thou directest the human race<br> Cast upon him a ray of peace, and let it cure his suffering.<br> The man, son of his god, has laid before him his shortcomings and transgressions; his feet and hands are in pain, grievously defiled by disease.<br> Sun, to the lifting up of my hands pay attention; eat his food, receive the victim, give his god, for a support, to his hand!<br> By his order let his shortcomings be pardoned! Let his transgressions be blotted out!<br> May his troubles leave him! May he recover from his disease!<br> Give back life to the King!<br> Then, on the day that he revives, may thy sublimity envelop him!<br> Direct the King who is in subjection to thee!<br> And me, the magician, thy humble servant, direct me!</dir>
