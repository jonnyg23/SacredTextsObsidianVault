 <p><a name="fn_20"></a><a href="twp05.htm#fr_20">18:1</a> Johann Weyer was a German physician, who in 1563 put forth a book attacking the witch-persecution. Loos had been influenced by this and was looked on as Weyer's disciple.</p>

Waldbrühl, who prints from it this extract in his <i>Naturforschung</i> and <i>Hexenglaube</i>, (Berlin, 1867). He says only that it had shortly before been found in the Salm archives. It belongs, doubtless, to the early seventeenth century. Bonn, not then a university town, was the official residence of the Prince-Archbishops of Cologne.</p>
