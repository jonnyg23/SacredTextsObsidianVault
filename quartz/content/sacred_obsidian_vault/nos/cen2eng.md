 <center><h1>Century II</h1></center>
 <p>
 1<br>
 Towards Aquitaine by the British Isles<br>
 By these themselves great incursions.<br>
 Rains, frosts will make the soil uneven,<br>
 Port Selyn will make mighty invasions<br>
 </p><p>
 2<br>
 The blue head will inflict upon the white head<br>
 As much evil as France has done them good:<br>
 Dead at the sail-yard the great one hung on the branch.<br>
 When seized by his own the King will say how much.<br>
 </p><p>
 3<br>
 Because of the solar heat on the sea<br>
 From Negrepont the fishes half cooked:<br>
 The inhabitants will come to cut them,<br>
 When food will fail in Rhodes and Genoa.<br>
 </p><p>
 4<br>
 From Monaco to near Sicily<br>
 The entire coast will remain desolated:<br>
 There will remain there no suburb, city or town<br>
 Not pillaged and robbed by the Barbarians.<br>
 </p><p>
 5<br>
 That which is enclosed in iron and letter in a fish,<br>
 Out will go one who will then make war,<br>
 He will have his fleet well rowed by sea,<br>
 Appearing near Latin land.<br>
 </p><p>
 6<br>
 Near the gates and within two cities<br>
 There will be two scourges the like of which was never seen,<br>
 Famine within plague, people put out by steel,<br>
 Crying to the great immortal God for relief.<br>
 </p><p>
 7<br>
 Amongst several transported to the isles,<br>
 One to be born with two teeth in his mouth<br>
 They will die of famine the trees stripped,<br>
 For them a new King issues a new edict.<br>
 </p><p>
 8<br>
 Temples consecrated in the original Roman manner,<br>
 They will reject the excess foundations,<br>
 Taking their first and humane laws,<br>
 Chasing, though not entirely, the cult of saints.<br>
 </p><p>
 9<br>
 Nine years the lean one will hold the realm in peace,<br>
 Then he will fall into a very bloody thirst:<br>
 Because of him a great people will die without faith and law<br>
 Killed by one far more good-natured.<br>
 </p><p>
 10<br>
 Before long all will be set in order,<br>
 We will expect a very sinister century,<br>
 The state of the masked and solitary ones much changed,<br>
 Few will be found who want to be in their place.<br>
 </p><p>
 11<br>
 The nearest son of the elder will attain<br>
 Very great height as far as the realm of the privileged:<br>
 Everyone will fear his fierce glory,<br>
 But his children will be thrown out of the realm.<br>
 </p><p>
 12<br>
 Eyes closed, opened by antique fantasy,<br>
 The garb of the monks they will be put to naught:<br>
 The great monarch will chastise their frenzy,<br>
 Ravishing the treasure in front of the temples.<br>
 </p><p>
 13<br>
 The body without soul no longer to be sacrificed:<br>
 Day of death put for birthday:<br>
 The divine spirit will make the soul happy,<br>
 Seeing the word in its eternity.<br>
 </p><p>
 14<br>
 At Tours, Gien, guarded, eyes will be searching,<br>
 Discovering from afar her serene Highness:<br>
 She and her suite will enter the port,<br>
 Combat, thrust, sovereign power.<br>
 </p><p>
 15<br>
 Shortly before the monarch is assassinated,<br>
 Castor and Pollux in the ship, bearded star:<br>
 The public treasure emptied by land and sea,<br>
 Pisa, Asti, Ferrara, Turin land under interdict.<br>
 </p><p>
 16<br>
 Naples, Palermo, Sicily, Syracuse,<br>
 New tyrants, celestial lightning fires:<br>
 Force from London, Ghent, Brussels and Susa,<br>
 Great slaughter, triumph leads to festivities.<br>
 </p><p>
 17<br>
 The field of the temple of the vestal virgin,<br>
 Not far from Elne and the Pyrenees mountains:<br>
 The great tube is hidden in the trunk.<br>
 To the north rivers overflown and vines battered.<br>
 </p><p>
 18<br>
 New, impetuous and sudden rain<br>
 Will suddenly halt two armies.<br>
 Celestial stone, fires make the sea stony,<br>
 The death of seven by land and sea sudden.<br>
 </p><p>
 19<br>
 Newcomers, place built without defense,<br>
 Place occupied then uninhabitable:<br>
 Meadows, houses, fields, towns to take at pleasure,<br>
 Famine, plague, war, extensive land arable.<br>
 </p><p>
 20<br>
 Brothers and sisters captive in diverse places<br>
 Will find themselves passing near the monarch:<br>
 Contemplating them his branches attentive,<br>
 Displeasing to see the marks on chin, forehead and nose.<br>
 </p><p>
 21<br>
 The ambassador sent by biremes,<br>
 Halfway repelled by unknown ones:<br>
 Reinforced with salt four triremes will come,<br>
 In Euboea bound with ropes and chains.<br>
 </p><p>
 22<br>
 The imprudent army of Europe will depart,<br>
 Collecting itself near the submerged isle:<br>
 The weak fleet will bend the phalanx,<br>
 At the navel of the world a greater voice substituted.<br>
 </p><p>
 23<br>
 Palace birds, chased out by a bird,<br>
 Very soon after the prince has arrived:<br>
 Although the enemy is repelled beyond the river,<br>
 Outside seized the trick upheld by the bird.<br>
 </p><p>
 24<br>
 Beasts ferocious from hunger will swim across rivers:<br>
 The greater part of the region will be against the Hister, <br>
 The great one will cause it to be dragged in an iron cage,<br>
 When the German child will observe nothing.<br>
 </p><p>
 25<br>
 The foreign guard will betray the fortress,<br>
 Hope and shadow of a higher marriage:<br>
 Guard deceived, fort seized in the press,<br>
 Loire, Saone, Rhone, Garonne, mortal outrage.<br>
 </p><p>
 26<br>
 Because of the favor that the city will show<br>
 To the great one who will soon lose the field of battle,<br>
 Fleeing the Po position, the Ticino will overflow<br>
 With blood, fires, deaths, drowned by the long-edged blow.<br>
 </p><p>
 27<br>
 The divine word will be struck from the sky,<br>
 One who cannot proceed any further:<br>
 The secret closed up with the revelation, <br>
 Such that they will march over and ahead.<br>
 </p><p>
 28<br>
 The penultimate of the surname of the Prophet<br>
 Will take Diana [Thursday] for his day and rest:<br>
 He will wander far because of a frantic head,<br>
 And delivering a great people from subjection.<br>
 </p><p>
 29<br>
 The Easterner will leave his seat,<br>
 To pass the Apennine mountains to see Gaul:<br>
 He will transpire the sky, the waters and the snow,<br>
 And everyone will be struck with his rod.<br>
 </p><p>
 30<br>
 One who the infernal gods of Hannibal<br>
 Will cause to be reborn, terror of mankind<br>
 Never more horror nor worse of days<br>
 In the past than will come to the Romans through Babel.<br>
 </p><p>
 31<br>
 In Campania the Capuan [river] will do so much<br>
 That one will see only fields covered by waters:<br>
 Before and after the long rain<br>
 One will see nothing green except the trees.<br>
 </p><p>
 32<br>
 Milk, frog's blood prepared in Dalmatia.<br>
 Conflict given, plague near Treglia:<br>
 A great cry will sound through all Slavonia,<br>
 Then a monster will be born near and within Ravenna.<br>
 </p><p>
 33<br>
 Through the torrent which descends from Verona<br>
 Its entry will then be guided to the Po,<br>
 A great wreck, and no less in the Garonne,<br>
 When those of Genoa march against their country.<br>
 </p><p>
 34<br>
 The senseless ire of the furious combat<br>
 Will cause steel to be flashed at the table by brothers:<br>
 To part them death, wound, and curiously,<br>
 The proud duel will come to harm France.<br>
 </p><p>
 35<br>
 The fire by night will take hold in two lodgings,<br>
 Several within suffocated and roasted.<br>
 It will happen near two rivers as one:<br>
 Sun, Sagittarius and Capricorn all will be reduced.<br>
 </p><p>
 36<br>
 The letters of the great Prophet will be seized,<br>
 They will come to fall into the hands of the tyrant:<br>
 His enterprise will be to deceive his King,<br>
 But his extortions will very soon trouble him.<br>
 </p><p>
 37<br>
 Of that great number that one will send<br>
 To relieve those besieged in the fort,<br>
 Plague and famine will devour them all,<br>
 Except seventy who will be destroyed.<br>
 </p><p>
 38<br>
 A great number will be condemned<br>
 When the monarchs will be reconciled:<br>
 But for one of them such a bad impediment will arise<br>
 That they will be joined together but loosely.<br>
 </p><p>
 39.<br>
 One year before the Italian conflict,<br>
 Germans, Gauls, Spaniards for the fort:<br>
 The republican schoolhouse will fall,<br>
 There, except for a few, they will be choked dead.<br>
 </p><p>
 40<br>
 Shortly afterwards, without a very long interval,<br>
 By sea and land a great uproar will be raised:<br>
 Naval battle will be very much greater,<br>
 Fires, animals, those who will cause greater insult.<br>
 </p><p>
 41<br>
 The great star will burn for seven days,<br>
 The cloud will cause two suns to appear:<br>
 The big mastiff will howl all night<br>
 When the great pontiff will change country.<br>
 </p><p>
 42<br>
 Cock, dogs and cats will be satiated with blood<br>
 And from the wound of the tyrant found dead,<br>
 At the bed of another legs and arms broken,<br>
 He who was not afraid to die a cruel death.<br>
 </p><p>
 43<br>
 During the appearance of the bearded star.<br>
 The three great princes will be made enemies:<br>
 Struck from the sky, peace earth quaking,<br>
 Po, Tiber overflowing, serpent placed upon the shore.<br>
 </p><p>
 44<br>
 The Eagle driven back around the tents<br>
 Will be chased from there by other birds:<br>
 When the noise of cymbals, trumpets and bells<br>
 Will restore the senses of the senseless lady.<br>
 </p><p>
 45.<br>
 Too much the heavens weep for the Androgyne begotten,<br>
 Near the heavens human blood shed:<br>
 Because of death too late a great people re-created,<br>
 Late and soon the awaited relief comes.<br>
 </p><p>
 46<br>
 After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is prepared<br>
 The Great Mover renews the ages:<br>
 Rain, blood, milk, famine, steel and plague,<br>
 Is the heavens fire seen, a long spark running.<br>
 </p><p>
 47<br>
 The great old enemy mourning dies of poison,<br>
 The sovereigns subjugated in infinite numbers:<br>
 Stones raining, hidden under the fleece,<br>
 Through death articles are cited in vain.<br>
 </p><p>
 48<br>
 The great force which will pass the mountains.<br>
 Saturn in Sagittarius Mars turning from the fish:<br>
 Poison hidden under the heads of salmon,<br>
 Their war-chief hung with cord.<br>
 </p><p>
 49<br>
 The advisers of the first monopoly,<br>
 The conquerors seduced for Malta:<br>
 Rhodes, Byzantium for them exposing their pole:<br>
 Land will fail the pursuers in flight.<br>
 </p><p>
 50<br>
 When those of Hainault, of Ghent and of Brussels<br>
 Will see the siege laid before Langres:<br>
 Behind their flanks there will be cruel wars,<br>
 The ancient wound will do worse than enemies.<br>
 </p><p>
 52<br>
 The blood of the just will commit a fault at London,<br>
 Burnt through lightning of twenty threes the six:<br>
 The ancient lady will fall from her high place,<br>
 Several of the same sect will be killed.<br>
 </p><p>
 52<br>
 For several nights the earth will tremble:<br>
 In the spring two efforts in succession:<br>
 Corinth, Ephesus will swim in the two seas:<br>
 War stirred up by two valiant in combat.<br>
 </p><p>
 53<br>
 The great plague of the maritime city<br>
 Will not cease until there be avenged the death<br>
 Of the just blood, condemned for a price without crime,<br>
 Of the great lady outraged by pretense.<br>
 </p><p>
 54.<br>
 Because of people strange, and distant from the Romans<br>
 Their great city much troubled after water:<br>
 Daughter handless, domain too different,<br>
 Chief taken, lock not having been picked.<br>
 </p><p>
 55<br>
 In the conflict the great one who was worth little<br>
 At his end will perform a marvelous deed:<br>
 While Adria will see what he was lacking,<br>
 During the banquet the proud one stabbed.<br>
 </p><p>
 56<br>
 One whom neither plague nor steel knew how to finish,<br>
 Death on the summit of the hills struck from the sky:<br>
 The abbot will die when he will see ruined<br>
 Those of the wreck wishing to seize the rock.<br>
 </p><p>
 57<br>
 Before the conflict the great wall will fall,<br>
 The great one to death, death too sudden and lamented,<br>
 Born imperfect: the greater part will swim:<br>
 Near the river the land stained with blood.<br>
 </p><p>
 58<br>
 With neither foot nor hand because of sharp and strong tooth<br>
 Through the crowd to the fort of the pork and the elder born:<br>
 Near the portal treacherous proceeds,<br>
 Moon shining, little great one led off.<br>
 </p><p>
 59<br>
 Gallic fleet through support of the great guard<br>
 Of the great Neptune, and his trident soldiers,<br>
 Provence reddened to sustain a great band:<br>
 More at Narbonne, because of javelins and darts.<br>
 </p><p>
 60<br>
 The Punic faith broken in the East,<br>
 Ganges, Jordan, and Rhone, Loire, and Tagus will change:<br>
 When the hunger of the mule will be satiated,<br>
 Fleet sprinkles, blood and bodies will swim.<br>
 </p><p>
 61<br>
 Bravo, ye of Tamins, Gironde and La Rochelle:<br>
 O Trojan blood! Mars at the port of the arrow<br>
 Behind the river the ladder put to the fort,<br>
 Points to fire great murder on the breach.<br>
 </p><p>
 62<br>
 Mabus then will soon die, there will come<br>
 Of people and beasts a horrible rout:<br>
 Then suddenly one will see vengeance,<br>
 Hundred, hand, thirst, hunger when the comet will run.<br>
 </p><p>
 64<br>
 The Gauls Ausonia will subjugate very little,<br>
 Po, Marne and Seine Parma will make drunk:<br>
 He who will prepare the great wall against them,<br>
 He will lose his life from the least at the wall.<br>
 </p><p>
 64<br>
 The people of Geneva drying up with hunger, with thirst,<br>
 Hope at hand will come to fail:<br>
 On the point of trembling will be the law of him of the Cevennes,<br>
 Fleet at the great port cannot be received.<br>
 </p><p>
 65<br>
 The sloping park great calamity<br>
 To be done through Hesperia and Insubria:<br>
 The fire in the ship, plague and captivity, <br>
 Mercury in Sagittarius Saturn will fade.<br>
 </p><p>
 66<br>
 Through great dangers the captive escaped:<br>
 In a short time great his fortune changed.<br>
 In the palace the people are trapped,<br>
 Through good omen the city besieged.<br>
 </p><p>
 67<br>
 The blond one will come to compromise the fork-nosed one<br>
 Through the duel and will chase him out:<br>
 The exiles within he will have restored,<br>
 Committing the strongest to the marine places.<br>
 </p><p>
 68<br>
 The efforts of Aquilon will be great:<br>
 The gate on the Ocean will be opened,<br>
 The kingdom on the Isle will be restored:<br>
 London will tremble discovered by sail.<br>
 </p><p>
 69<br>
 The Gallic King through his Celtic right arm<br>
 Seeing the discord of the great Monarchy:<br>
 He will cause his scepter to flourish over the three parts,<br>
 Against the cope of the great Hierarchy.<br>
 </p><p>
 70<br>
 The dart from the sky will make its extension,<br>
 Deaths speaking: great execution.<br>
 The stone in the tree, the proud nation restored,<br>
 Noise, human monster, purge expiation.<br>
 </p><p>
 71<br>
 The exiles will come into Sicily<br>
 To deliver form hunger the strange nation:<br>
 At daybreak the Celts will fail them:<br>
 Life remains by reason: the King joins.<br>
 </p><p>
 72<br>
 Celtic army vexed in Italy <br>
 On all sides conflict and great loss:<br>
 Romans fled, O Gaul repelled!<br>
 Near the Ticino, Rubicon uncertain battle.<br>
 </p><p>
 73<br>
 The shore of Lake Garda to Lake Fucino,<br>
 Taken from the Lake of Geneva to the port of L'Orguion:<br>

 Through three crowns to the great Endymion.<br>
 </p><p>
 74<br>
 From Sens, from Autun they will come as far as the Rhone<br>
 To pass beyond towards the Pyrenees mountains:<br>

 </p><p>
 75<br>

 That man will be eating his fellow man.<br>
 </p><p>
 76.<br>
 Lightning in Burgundy will perform a portentous deed,<br>
 One which could never have been done by skill,<br>

 Will make the affair known to the enemies.<br>
 </p><p>
 77<br>
 Hurled back through bows, fires, pitch and by fires:<br>
 Cries, howls heard at midnight:<br>
 Within they are place on the broken ramparts,<br>
 The traitors fled by the underground passages.<br>
 </p><p>
 78.<br>
 The great Neptune of the deep of the sea <br>
 With Punic race and Gallic blood mixed.<br>
 The Isles bled, because of the tardy rowing:<br>
 More harm will it do him than the ill-concealed secret.<br>
 </p><p>
 79<br>
 The beard frizzled and black through skill<br>
 Will subjugate the cruel and proud people:<br>
 The great Chyren will remove from far away<br>
 All those captured by the banner of Selin<br>
 </p><p>
 80<br>
 After the conflict by the eloquence of the wounded one<br>

 The great one does not escape in the middle of the crowd.<br>
 </p><p>
 83<br>
 The large trade of a great Lyons changed,<br>
 The greater part turns to pristine ruin<br>
 Prey to the soldiers swept away by pillage:<br>
 Through the Jura mountain and Suevia drizzle.<br>
 </p><p>
 84<br>
 Between Campania, Siena, Florence, Tuscany,<br>
 Six months nine days without a drop of rain:<br>

 It will overrun, devastating the entire land.<br>
 </p><p>
 85<br>

 Noise of arms in the sky: Ligurian sea red.<br>
 </p><p>
 86<br>
 Wreck for the fleet near the Adriatic Sea:<br>
 The land trembles stirred up upon the air placed on land:<br>
 Egypt trembles Mahometan increase, <br>
 The Herald surrendering himself is appointed to cry out.<br>
 </p><p>
 87<br>
 After there will come from the outermost countries<br>
 A German Prince, upon the golden throne:<br>
 The servitude and waters met,<br>
 The lady serves, her time no longer adored.<br>
 </p><p>
 88<br>

 Without a quarter of a million escaping.<br>
 </p><p>
 95<br>

 Burning torch will be seen in the sky at night<br>
 Near the end and beginning of the Rhone:<br>
 Famine, steel: the relief provided late,<br>
 Persia turns to invade Macedonia.<br>
 </p><p>
 97<br>
 Roman Pontiff beware of approaching<br>
 The city that two rivers flow through,<br>
 Near there your blood will come to spurt, <br>
 You and yours when the rose will flourish.<br>

 98<br>
 The one whose face is splattered with the blood<br>
 Of the victim nearly sacrificed:<br>
 Jupiter in Leon, omen through presage:<br>
 To be put to death then for the bride.<br>
 </p><p>
 99<br>
 Roman land as the omen interpreted<br>
 Will be vexed too much by the Gallic people:<br>
 But the Celtic nation will fear the hour,<br>
 The fleet has been pushed too far by the north wind.<br>
 </p><p>
 100<br>
 Within the isles a very horrible uproar,<br>
 One will hear only a party of war,<br>
 So great will be the insult of the plunderers<br>
 That they will come to be joined in the great league.<br>
