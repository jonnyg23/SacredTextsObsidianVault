 <center><h1>Nostradamus (French-English)</h1></center>
 This is a merged French and English version of the prophecies of Nostradamus.  Several variations of the French text are given, based on the available versions.   This is due to the non-standard orthography which is typical of documents of the era.<p>This collection is not perfect as it is based on several inconsistent Nostradamus archives found on the Internet which were collated mechanically using a custom C program.</p><p>Not all verses are provided with an English translation; in some cases the verse numbering may be out of synch.</p><p>There are few (English) verses which are apocryphal.  They are marked with an asterisk.  These do not have a matching French version although reputedly they are based on verses inserted into later French versions of Nostradamus.  They should not be considered authoritative in the bibliographic sense.</p><p></p><p>
