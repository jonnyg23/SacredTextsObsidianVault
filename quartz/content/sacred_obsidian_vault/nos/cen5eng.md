 Those assembled by the tranquillity of the great number,<br>
 By land and sea counsel countermanded:<br>
 Near Antonne Genoa, Nice in the shadow<br>
 Through fields and towns in revolt against the chief.<br>
 </p><p>
 65<br>
 Come suddenly the terror will be great,<br>
 Hidden by the principal ones of the affair:<br>
 And the lady on the charcoal will no longer be in sight,<br>
 Thus little by little will the great ones be angered.<br>

 The two will not be united for very long,<br>
