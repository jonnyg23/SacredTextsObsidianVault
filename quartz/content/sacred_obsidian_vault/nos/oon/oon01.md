 <p align="CENTER">TO MY MOTHER</p> 
 <p>Οὐδὲν ἐν ἀνθρώποισι πατρὸς καὶ μετρὸς ἄμενον<br> Ἔπλετο, τοῖσ ὁσίη, Κύρνε, μέμηλε δίκη.</p> 
 <p align="RIGHT">THEOGNIS, p. 16, ed. 1766.</p> 
 <p>"But higher far my proud pretensions rise,--<br> The son of parents passed into the skies."</p> 
 <p align="RIGHT">COWPER, On My Mother's Picture, line 110.</p> 
 <p>IF THERE CAN BE ANYTHING IN A BOOK LIKE THIS WORTHY OF DEDICATION TO A BEING SO NOBLE AS THOU IN LIFE WERT EVER, A BEING NOW MORE ENNOBLED STILL BY THE HEAVEN-BLEACHED RAIMENT OF IMMORTALITY PUT ON; TO THEE, PURE SOUL SERENE! TO THEE DOES THY STILL LOVING SON, EARTH-HAMPERED, DEDICATE THIS THE BEST LABOUR OF HIS HEART AND HEAD AND YEARS. THE BEST OF IT IS THINE INDEED ALREADY; AND WERE THE REST WORSE HARVESTED THAN PERHAPS IT IS,--MORTALITY BEING ALLOWED FOR DULY,--THY SOUL RECEIVING MUST BE MUCH CHANGED BY EXALTATION, IF QUEEN-LIKE, IT CANNOT MAKE A SORRY LOVE-GIFT RICH BY GOLDEN WELCOME GIVEN IT.</p> 
 <p>IF THINGS OF KITH BE KIN, GOD WILLING, WE SHALL MEET AGAIN ERE LONG. TILL WHEN, FROM THIS BARE HEATH TERRENE AND HOMELESS, I SPEED THE WORD ADIEU. DEAR ONE! FOR A LITTLE WHILE ADIEU.</p> 
 <p align="RIGHT">THY SON,          <br> Mr. C. A. W.</p>
