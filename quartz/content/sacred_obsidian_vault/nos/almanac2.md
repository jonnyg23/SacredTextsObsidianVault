 				Almanac of 1564<br>
 </p><p>
 The sextile year rains, wheat to abound, hatreds,<br>
 Joy to men, Princes, King divorced:<br>
 Herd to perish, human mutations,<br>
 People oppressed and poison under the surface.<br>
 </p><p>
 Times very diverse, discord discovered,<br>
 Council of war, change taken in, changed:<br>
 The Great Woman must not be, conspirators through water lost,<br>
 Great hostility, for the great one all steady.<br>
 </p><p>
 The bit of the enemy's tongue approaches,<br>
 The Debonair one to peace will want to reduce:<br>
 The obstinate ones will want to lose the kinswoman,<br>
 Surprised, Captives, and suspects fury to injure.<br>
 </p><p>
 Fathers and mothers dead of infinite sorrows,<br>
 Women in mourning, the pestilent she-monster:<br>
 The Great One to be no more, all the world to end,<br>
 Under peace, repose and every single one in opposition.<br>
 </p><p>
 Princes and Christendom stirred up in debates,<br>
 Foreign nobles, Christ's See molested:<br>
 Become very evil, much good, mortal sight.<br>
 Death in the East, plague, famine, evil treaty.<br>
 </p><p>
 Land to tremble, killed, wasteful, monster,<br>
 Captives without number, to do, undone, done:<br>
 To go over the sea misfortune will occur,<br>
 Proud against the proud evil done in disguise.<br>
 </p><p>
 The unjust one lowered, they will molest him fiercely,<br>
 Hail, to flood, treasure, and engraved marble:<br>
 Chief of Persuasion people will kill to death,<br>
 And attached will be the blade to the tree.<br>
 </p><p>
 Of what not evil? inexcusable result,<br>
 The fire not double, the Legate outside confused:<br>
 Against the worse wounded the fight will not be made,<br>
 The end of June the thread cut by firing.<br>
 </p><p>
 Fine bonds enfeebled by accords,<br>
 Mars and Prelates united will not stop:<br>
 The great ones confused by gifts of mutilated bodies,<br>
 Dignified ones, undignified ones will seize the well endowed.<br>
 </p><p>
 From good to the evil times will change,<br>
 The peace in the South, the expectation of the Greatest Ones:<br>
 The Great Ones grieving Louis too much more will stumble,<br>
 Well-known Shaven Ones have neither power not understanding.<br>
 </p><p>
 This is the month for evils so many as to be doubled,<br>
 Deaths, plague to drain all, famine, to quarrel:<br>
 Those of the reverse of exile will come to note,<br>
 Great Ones, secrets, deaths, not to censure.<br>
 </p><p>
 Through death, death to bite, counsel, robbery, pestiferous,<br>
 They will not dare to attack the Marines:<br>
 Deucalion a final trouble to make,<br>
 Few young people: half-dead to give a start.<br>
 </p><p>
 Dead through spite he will cause the others to shine,<br>
 And in an exalted place some great evils to occur:<br>
 Sad concepts will come to harm each one,<br>
 Temporal dignified, the Mass to succeed.<br>
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 				Almanac of 1566<br>
 </p><p>
 For the greatest ones death, loss of honor and violence,<br>
 Professors of the faith, their estate and their sect:<br>
 For the two great Churches diverse noise, decadence,<br>
 Evil neighbors quarreling serfs of the Church without a head.<br>
 </p><p>
 Waste, great loss, and not without violence,<br>
 All those of the faith, more for religion,<br>
 The Greatest Ones will lose their lives, their honor and fortunes<br>
 Both the two Churches, the sin in their faction.<br>
 </p><p>
 For the two very Great Ones pernicious loss to arise,<br>
 The Greatest Ones will cause loss, goods, of honor, and of life,<br>
 As much great noises will run, the urn very odious,<br>
 Great maladies to be, meeting-house, mass in envy.<br>
 </p><p>
 The servants of the Churches will betray their Lords,<br>
 Of other Lords also by the undivided of the fields:<br>
 Neighbors of meeting-house and mass will quarrel amongst them,<br>
 Rumors, noises to augment, to death are several lying.<br>
 </p><p>
 Of all blessings abundance, the earth will produce for us,<br>
 No din of war in France, sedition put outside:<br>
 Man-slayers, robbers one will find on the highway,<br>
 Little faith, burning fever, people in commotion.<br>
 </p><p>
 Between people discord, brutal enmity,<br>
 War, death of great Princes, several parts:<br>
 Universal plague, stronger in the West,<br>
 Times good and full, but very dry and exhausted.<br>
 </p><p>
 The grains not to be plentiful, in all other fruits, plenty,<br>
 The Summer, spring humid, winter long, snow, ice:<br>
 The East in arms, France reinforces herself,<br>
 Death of beasts much honey, the place to be besieged.<br>
 </p><p>
 Through pestilence and fire fruits of trees will perish,<br>
 Signs of oil to abound.  Father Denis not scarce:<br>
 Some great ones to die, but few foreigners will sally forth in attack,<br>
 Offense, Barbarian marines, and dangers at the frontiers.<br>
 </p><p>
 Rains very excessive, and of blessings abundance,<br>
 The cattle price to be just, women outside of danger:<br>
 Hail, rain, thunder: people depressed in France,<br>
 Through death they will work, death to reprove people.<br>
 </p><p>
 Arms, plagues to cease, death of the seditious ones,<br>
 Great Father Liber will not much abound:<br>
 Evil ones will be seized by more malicious ones,<br>
 France more than ever victorious will triumph.<br>
 </p><p>
 Up to this month the great drought will endure,<br>
 For Italy and Provence all fruits to half:<br>
 The Great One less of enemies prisoner of their band,<br>
 For the scroungers, Pirates, and the enemy to die.<br>
 </p><p>
 The enemy so much to be feared to retire into Thrace,<br>
 Leaving cries, howls, and pillage desolated:<br>
 To leave noise on sea and land, religion murdered,<br>
 Jovial Ones put on the road, every sect to become angry.<br>
 </p><p>
