 The authorship of this book (by a Jesuit ethnologist)
 makes some of the editorial content suspect.
 However, the author spent time in the field in Jamaica.
 His library research was extensive and used rare and unique sources
 such as contemporary newspapers, legal archives and early accounts.
 Williams keeps his skepticism active while remaining open-minded.
 On the downside there are some passages which
 could be interpreted as racist (in hindsight),
 so the usual disclaimers apply.

 All that said, this book remains a good introduction to the
 outlines of this subject.
 If you've ever listened to
 a Reggae song about 'Duppies' and wondered what they
 were talking about, now you'll know. -jbh
