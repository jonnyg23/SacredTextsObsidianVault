 <td>Bequeathed from other times. . . A tale is told<br>
 How God in the Beginning sent three sons<br>
 Into the World—Earth, Water and the Forest—<br>
 With one and twenty gifts for Earth and men<br>
 That are the sons of Earth; and all save one<br>
 The Forest and the Rivers stole; and how<br>
 God promised to his first-born, Earth, that men<br>
 Should win the twenty gifts again by virtue<br>
 Of that last one, Good Humour. And this is true:<br>
 For in those years when Ógun and the Gods<br>
 Made known their handicrafts men learned to seek<br>
 Thatch, food and wine in Forest and in River</td></tr>

 <td>Patiently. So Man prevailed; but in those days<br>
 Came strife and turmoil to the Gods—for still<br>
 For jealousy and pride Odúwa held<br>
 The bag Arámfè gave to Great Orísha.<br>
 Often Orísha made entreaty; oft<br>
 A suppliant came before his brother—in vain;<br>
 Till once when Odudúwa sat with Ógun<br>

 In that same palace where the Órní reigns,<br>
 The sound of drums was heard and Great Orísha<br>
 Approached with skilled Obálufon, and said:<br>
 "The time has come to teach Arámfè's arts<br>
 "To men. Give back the bag (for it is mine!)<br>
 That I may do our Father's bidding. Else,<br>
 Have a care, is it not told how caution slept<br>
 In the still woods when the proud leopard fell,<br>
 Lured on by silence, 'neath the monster's foot?"<a name="page_28_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_28_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Then was Odúwa angered exceedingly:<br>
 "Am I not king? Did not Arámfè make<br>
 Me lord of Gods and men? Begone! Who speaks<br>
 Unseemly words before the king has packed<br>
 His load."<a name="page_28_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_28_note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a></td></tr>

 And on that day the first of wars began<br>
 In Ífè and the Forest. Such was the fall<br>
 Of the Gods from paths divine, and such for men<br>

 But little the Gods recked of their deep guilt<br>

 Returned the memory of Calm, their heritage,<br>
 Of Heaven born and destined for the World;<br>
 Gloom, too, with the still night came down: a sense<br>
 Of impious wrong, ungodly sin, weighed down<br>
 Warriors aweary, and all was changed. Around,<br>
 Dead, dead the Forest seemed, its boughs unstirred;<br>
 Dead too, amidst its strangling, knotted growth<br>

 <td>Mute herald, came the distant thundrous voice<br>
 Of Old Arámfè as he mused: "In vain<br>
 Into the Waste beneath I sent my sons—<br>
 The children of my happy vales—to make<br>
 A World of mirth: for desolation holds<br>
 The homes of Ífè, and women with their babes<br>
 Are outcast in the naked woods." But when<br>
 The whirling clouds were wheeling in the sky<br>
 And the great trees were smitten by the wind,<br>
 Thundrous Arámfè in his ire rebuked<br>
 His erring sons: "At my command you came<br>
 To darkness, where the Evil of the Void—<br>
 Insentient Violence—had made its home,<br>
 To shape in the Abyss a World of joy<br>

 And lead Creation in the ways of Heaven.<br>
 How, then, this brawling? Did the Void's black soul<br>
 Outmatch you, or possess your hearts to come<br>
 Again into its own? For Man's misfortune<br>
 I grieve; but you have borne them on the tide<br>
 Of your wrong-doing, and your punishment<br>
 Is theirs to share. For now my thunderbolts<br>
 I hurl, with deluges upon the land—<br>
 To fill the marshes and lagoons, and stay<br>
 For aye your impious war."</td></tr>

 <td>Was gone, and Old Arámfè in his grief<br>
 Departed on black clouds. But still the wrath,<br>
 But still the anger of his sons endured,<br>
 And in the dripping forests and the marshes<br>
 The rebel Gods fought on—while in the clouds<br>
 Afar Arámfè reasoned with himself:<br>
 "I spoke in thunders, and my deluge filled<br>
 The marshes that Ojúmu dried;—but still<br>
 They fight. Punish, I may—but what can I<br>
 Achieve? In Heaven omnipotent: but here—?<br>
 What means it? I cannot tell. . . In the Unknown,<br>
 Beyond the sky where I have set the Sun,<br>

 Is He-Who-Speaks-Not: He knows all. Can this<br>
 Be Truth: Amidst the unnatural strife of brothers<br>
 The World was weaned: by strife must it endure—?"<br>
 Oíbo, how the first of wars began,<br>
 And Old Arámfè sought to stay the flow<br>
 Of blood—your pen has written; but of the days,<br>
 The weary days of all that war, what tongue<br>
 Can tell? 'Tis said the anger of the Gods<br>
 Endured two hundred years: we know the priest<br>
 Osányi made strange amulets for all<br>
 The mortal soldiers of the Gods—one charm<br>
 Could turn a spear aside, a second robbed<br>
 The wounding sword of all its sting, another<br>
 Made one so terrible that a full score<br>
 Must flee—but not one word of the great deeds,<br>
 Of hopes and fears, of imminent defeat<br>
 Or victory snatched away is handed down:<br>
 No legend has defied, no voice called through<br>
 The dimness and the baffling years.</td></tr>

 For while the Moon lay soft with all her spell<br>
 On Ífè of the many battles; while<br>
 With sorrowful reproach the wise trees stood<br>
 And gazed upon the Gods who made the soil<br>
 The voices of the Forest crooned their dreams<br>
 Of peace: "Sleep, sleep" all weary Nature craved,<br>
 And "Sleep" the slumbrous reed-folk urged, and 'twixt<br>
 The shadow and the silver'd leaf, for sleep</td></tr>

 <td>The drowsing breezes yearned. . . . And with the dawn<br>
 Ógun, the warrior, with his comrades stood<br>
 Before the king, and thus he spoke: "Odúwa,<br>
 We weary of the battle, and its agony<br>
 Weighs heavy on our people. Have you forgot<br>
 The careless hours of Old Arámfè's realm?<br>
 What means this war, this empty war between<br>
 One mother's sons? Orísha willed it so,<br>
 You say. . . 'Twas said of old 'Who has no house<br>
 Will buy no broom',<a name="page_32_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_32_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> Why then did Great Orísha<br>
 Bring plagues on those he made in love? In Heaven<br>
 Afar Arámfè gave to you the empire,<br>
 
 <!------------------------page 33------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a>
 
 And to Orísha knowledge of the ways<br>
 Of mysteries and hidden things. The bag<br>
 You seized; but not its clue—the skill, the wisdom<br>
 Of Great Orísha which alone could wake<br>
 The sleeping lore. . . The nations of the World<br>
 Are yours: give back the bag, and Great Orísha<br>
 Will trouble us no more." But neither Ógun<br>
 Nor the soft voices of the night could loose<br>
 Odúwa from the thrall of envy: the rule<br>
 Of men and empire were of no account<br>
 When the hot thought of Old Arámfè's lore<br>
 Roused his black ire anew. The bag he held;<br>
 But all the faithless years had not revealed<br>
 Its promised treasures. Bitterly he answered:</td></tr>
 <tr><td valign="top"><i>Odúwa<br>refuses;</i></td>
 <td>"These many years my brother has made war<br>
 Upon his king; while for the crown, its power<br>
 And greatness, I have wrought unceasing. To-day<br>
 My son—hope of my cause, my cause itself—<br>
 Wearies of war, and joins my enemies.<br>
 Weak son, the sceptre you were born to hold<br>
 And hand down strengthened to a line of kings<br>
 Could not uphold your will and be your spur<br>
 Until the end. Is it not said, "Shall one<br>
 Priest bury, and anon his mate dig up<br>

 But all my heart has longed for through a life<br>
 Of labour. So let it be: God of Soft Iron!<br>

 The crown of a diminished chieftaincy,<br>
 With the sweet honours of a king in name—<br>
