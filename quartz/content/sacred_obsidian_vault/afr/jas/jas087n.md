 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">87. Bull as Bridegroom.</h3>
 <p>The story of the beast-husband transformed by means of a song is very common in Jamaica. It occurs in Milne-Home, 42-45, and Jekyll, 73-77; 132-135.</p>
 <p>Compare Junod, 246-253; Parsons, Andros Island, 39-43 and references in note 1.</p>
 <p>In Parsons's Andros Island variants, the transformed beast is the wife (compare number 84) and has the form of a bird, as in Jekyll's two versions, one of which, 132-135, ends with the "Yonec" story. In all the versions I heard, and in Milne-Home, the wooer is a bull.</p>
