 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">42. Fire and Anansi.</h3>
 <p>A less witty version of this popular Jamaica story occurs in Jekyll, 129-131.</p>
 <p>In Dayrell, 64-65, Sun and Water are great friends. Sun visits Water, but Water never visits Sun. At length, Sun invites Water and builds a great compound to receive him and his friends. All come, take possession, and crowd Sun and his wife, Moon, out into the sky.</p>
