 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">33. Fling-a-mile.</h3>
 <p>Jekyll, 152-155, has a good version of this very popular Jamaica story.</p>
 <p>Compare the Bulu tales, Schwab, JAFL 27:284-285; 32:434.</p>
 <p>In JAFL 27, Turtle sets a trap and by pretending to teach other animals who come along one by one how to use it, he catches one victim after another until he is himself caught.</p>
 <p>In JAFL 32, Pangolin offers to initiate the animals one by one and makes them climb a tree and jump upon a concealed rock, which kills them. Turtle finally circumvents the trick.</p>
 <p>In a Jamaica version collected in Mandeville, Anansi holds a butchering at a place where there is a tree which seizes any person who leans against it and flings him upon a lance which Anansi has set up.</p>
