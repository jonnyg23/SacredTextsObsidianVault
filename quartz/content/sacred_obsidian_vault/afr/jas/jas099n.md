 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">99. The Water Cray fish.</h3>
 <p>In Jacottet, 166-174, Mosimoli has been killed by her stepmother for cooking and eating taboo food. When her step-sister comes to the water to fill her pitcher, Mosimoli comes out of the water, beats her and gives her muddy water to drink, singing, "My father and mother are the crocodile." Compare 79, 80, of this collection and Parsons, Andros Island, 140. The story is a mere fragment, but belongs to the very great number of tales which turn upon a broken taboo driving a supernatural visitor back to its original abode. The success of the story doubtless depends upon the song interest.</p>
