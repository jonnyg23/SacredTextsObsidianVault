 <center><i>NOTE:</i> </center><h3 align="CENTER">101. Bull-of-all-the-land.</h3>
 <p>Old Forbes gave me the only version of this story I heard in Jamaica. In Trowbridge, JAFL 9:284-285, the song and the incident of the three drops of blood occur, but the king is "King Tonga" and there is no beast transformation. The husband is lost</p>

 <p>by letting a little dog kiss him, as in number 105 and in Parsons, Andros Island, 55, 59, not by his wife's burning the skin as in this version.</p>
 <p>For the song at night as a means of recognition see number 74.</p>
 <p>See Grimm 88, The Singing Soaring Lark; Bolte u. Polívka 2:229-273.</p>
