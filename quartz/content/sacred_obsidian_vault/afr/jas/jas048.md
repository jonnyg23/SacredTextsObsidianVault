 <h3 align="CENTER">48. Why Dog is always Looking.</h3>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Moses Hendricks, Mandeville.</p>
 <p>Anansi and Dog were friends. They wanted to go into cultivation, so both of them went out in search of good lands to rent. They came across a nice bit of land. Anansi fell in love with the spot; Dog fell in love with the spot too. Anansi said to Dog he remembered when he was a little boy his father planted yams on that very spot of land,--"An' the yams did bear." Dog said, "How they bear big?" Anansi said, "Brar Dog, they bear <b><i>big,</i></b> they bear big like me leg!" (Anansi's leg is jus' like a thread!) Brar Dog say, "Before I work an' plant yam, an' the yam not bigger than you. leg, I sooner walk round an' look!" That's the reason why, when you're eating, a dog 'sure to be looking at you.</p>
