 <h2 align="center">XIII<br> THE WATER-BIRD</h2>
 
 <p>T<small>HE</small> water-bird always stands on one leg, and this is why:</p>
 
 <p> A water-bird once, in search of food, swallowed the King of the crabs, and the whole tribe of crabs were so enraged that they swore they would have their revenge.</p>

 pink in colour and its feathers are pink and white.”</p>
 
 <p> But the water-rat overheard the crabs plotting, and hastened to tell the water-bird.</p>
 
 <p> “Oh! Oh!” cried the water-bird. “They will nip off my beautiful pink legs, and then what will become of me? Whatever can I do?”</p>
 
 <p> “It is very simple,” replied the water-rat. “If you stand on one leg, they will think you are some other creature.”</p>
 
 <p> The bird thanked him and tucked up one leg. When the crabs came, they saw, as they thought, a very tall pink bird with one leg and a large beak.</p>
 
 <p> “Our enemy has two legs,” they said. “This cannot be he.” And they passed by.</p>
