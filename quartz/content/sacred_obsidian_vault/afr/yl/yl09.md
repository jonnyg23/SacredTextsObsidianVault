 <h2 align="center">VII<br> THE OL<u>O</u>FIN AND THE MICE</h2>
 
 <p>A <small>FAMOUS</small> Ol<u>o</u>fin, or Yoruba King, was once imprisoned by his enemies in a hut without any door or roof-opening, and left to die of starvation.</p>
 
 <p> As he sat gloomily on the ground, the Ol<u>o</u>fin saw a little mouse running across the hut. He seized his knife, exclaiming: “Rather than die of hunger, I will eat this mouse!”</p>
 
 <p> But on second thoughts he put away his knife, saying: “Why should I kill the mouse? I shall starve later on, just the same.”</p>

 <p> To his surprise the mouse addressed him in the following words:</p>
 
 <p> “Noble King! Greetings to you on your generosity! You have spared my life, and in return I will spare yours.”</p>
 
 <p> The mouse then disappeared into a hole in the ground, and returned some time afterwards followed by twenty or thirty other mice, all bearing grains of corn, gari, and small fruits.</p>
 
 <p> For five days they fed him in this manner, and on the sixth day the hut was opened by the Ol<u>o</u>fin’s captors, who were astonished to find him still alive and in good health.</p>
 
 <p> “This Ol<u>o</u>fin must have a powerful charm!” they declared. “It appears that he can live without eating or drinking!”</p>
 
 <p> Thereupon they released him, gave him a war-canoe, and let him return in freedom to his own country.</p>
