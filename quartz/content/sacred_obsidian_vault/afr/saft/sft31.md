 <p>TWO powers, Elephant and Rain, had a dispute. Elephant said, "If you say that you nourish me, in what way is it that you do so?" Rain answered, "If you say that I do not nourish you, when I go away, will you not die? And Rain then departed.</p> 
 <p>Elephant said, "Vulture! cast lots to make rain for me."</p> 
 <p>Vulture said, "I will not cast lots."</p> 
 <p>Then Elephant said to Crow, "Cast lots! who answered, "Give the things with which I may cast lots." Crow cast lots and rain fell. It rained at the lagoons, but they dried up, and only one lagoon remained.</p> 
 <p>Elephant went a-hunting. There was, however, Tortoise, to whom Elephant said, "Tortoise, remain at the water!" Thus Tortoise was left behind when Elephant went a-hunting.</p> 
 <p>There came Giraffe, and said to Tortoise, "Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Zebra, who said to Tortoise,</p> 
 <p>"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Gemsbok, and said to Tortoise,</p> 
 <p>"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Wildebeest, and said, "Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Roodebok, and said to Tortoise,</p> 
 <p>"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Springbok, and said to Tortoise,</p> 
 <p>"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Jackal, and said to Tortoise,</p> 
 <p>"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."</p> 
 <p>There came Lion, and said, "Little Tortoise, give me water!" When little Tortoise was about to say something, Lion got hold of him and beat him; Lion drank of the water, and since then the animals drink water.</p> 
 <p>When Elephant came back from the hunting, he said, "Little Tortoise, is there water?" Tortoise answered, "The animals have drunk the water." Elephant asked, "Little Tortoise, shall I chew you or swallow you down?" Little Tortoise said, "Swallow me, if you please!" and Elephant swallowed him whole.</p> 
 <p>After Elephant had swallowed Little Tortoise, and he had entered his body, he tore off his liver, heart, and kidneys. Elephant said, "Little Tortoise, you kill me."</p> 
 <p>So Elephant died; but little Tortoise came out of his dead body, and went wherever he liked.</p>
