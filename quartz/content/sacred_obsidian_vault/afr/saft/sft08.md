 <p>JACKAL and Wolf went and hired themselves to a man to be his servants. In the middle of the night Jackal rose and smeared Wolf's tail with some fat, and then ate all the rest of it in the house. In the morning the man missed the fat, and he immediately accused Jackal of having eaten it. "Look at Wolf's tale," said the rogue, "and you will see who is the thief." The man did so, and then thrashed Wolf till he was nearly dead.</p>
