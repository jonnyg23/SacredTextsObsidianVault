 <p>ONE day, it is said, the following story happened:</p> 
 <p>Mouse had torn the clothes of Itkler (the tailor), who then went to Baboon, and accused Mouse with these words:</p> 
 <p>"In this manner I come to thee: Mouse has torn my clothes, but will not know anything of it, and accuses Cat; Cat protests likewise her innocence, and says, 'Dog must have done it; but Dog denies it also, and declares Wood has done it; and Wood throws the blame on Fire, and says, 'Fire did it'; Fire says, ' have not, Water did it'; Water says, 'Elephant tore the clothes'; and Elephant says, 'Ant tore them.' Thus a dispute has arisen among them. Therefore, 1, Itkler, come to thee with this proposition: Assemble the people and try them in order that I may get satisfaction."</p> 
 <p>Thus he spake, and Baboon assembled them for trial. Then they made the same excuses which had been mentioned by Itkler, each one putting the blame upon the other.</p> 
 <p>So Baboon did not see any other way of punishing them, save through making them punish each other; he therefore said,</p> 
 <p>"Mouse, give Itkler satisfaction."</p> 
 <p>Mouse, however, pleaded not guilty. But Baboon said, "Cat, bite Mouse." She did so.</p> 
 <p>He then put the same question to Cat, and when she exculpated herself, Baboon called to Dog, "Here, bite Cat."</p> 
 <p>In this manner Baboon questioned them all, one after the other, but they each denied the charge. Then he addressed the following words to them, and said,</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>Wood, beat Dog.<br> Fire, burn Wood.<br> Water, quench Fire.<br> Elephant, drink Water.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Ant, bite Elephant in his most tender parts."</p> 
 <p>They did so, and since that day they cannot any longer agree with each other.</p> 
 <p>Ant enters into Elephant's most tender parts and bites him.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>Elephant swallows Water.<br> Water quenches Fire.<br> Fire consumes Wood.<br> Wood beats Dog.<br> Dog bites Cat.<br> And Cat bites Mouse.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>Through this judgment Itkler got satisfaction, and addressed Baboon in the following manner:</p> 
 <p>"Yes! Now I am content, since I have received satisfaction, and with all my heart I thank thee, Baboon, because thou hast exercised justice on my behalf and given me redress."</p> 
 <p>Then Baboon said, "From to-day I will not any longer be called Jan, but Baboon shall be my name."</p> 
 <p>Since that time Baboon walks on all fours, having probably lost the privilege of walking erect through this foolish judgment.</p>
