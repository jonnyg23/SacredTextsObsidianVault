 <p>LION, it is said, was ill, and they all went to see him in his suffering. But Jackal did not go, because the traces of the people who went to see him did not turn back. Thereupon, he was accused by Hyena, who said, "Though I go to look, yet Jackal does not want to come and look at the man's sufferings."</p> 
 <p>Then Lion let Hyena go, in order that she might catch Jackal; and she did so, and brought him.</p> 
 <p>Lion asked Jackal: "Why did you not come here to see me?"</p> 
 <p>Jackal said, "Oh, no! when I heard that my uncle was so very ill, I went to the witch (doctor) to consult him, whether and what medicine would be good for my uncle against the pain. The doctor said to me, 'Go and tell your uncle to take hold of Hyena and draw off her skin, and put it on while it is still warm. Then he will recover.' Hyena is one who does not care for my uncle's sufferings."</p> 
 <p>Lion followed his advice, got hold of Hyena, drew the skin over her cars, whilst she howled with all her might, and put it on.</p>
