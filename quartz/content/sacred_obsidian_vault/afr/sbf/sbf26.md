 <h1 align="CENTER">THE MAN WHO ORDERED HIS WIFE TO CUT OFF HIS EARS.</h1>
 <p>He<small>[1]</small> formerly wished (his) wife to cut off his ears, for his younger brother's head had surely been skinned<small>[2]</small>; whereas his younger brother's wife had only shaved his younger brother's head.</p>
 <p>Therefore, (his) wife cut away his ears; although (his) wife had said that she would not do so; he was the one who insisted (upon it).</p>
 <p>Therefore, (his) wife cut off his ears; and he was screaming, on account of his skin, while he himself had been the one who wished the wife to do so; for his younger brother's head had surely been skinned; whereas his younger brother had merely had his head shaved; while (his) wife shaved, removing the old hair.<small>[3]</small></p>
 <p><small>[1. <i>!Xwe-|na-sse-!k'e</i> is the name of the Bushmen who lived first in the land.</small></p>
 <p>2. I am one who does not know his name, because the people were those who did not utter his name to me; for, they were men of the early race; therefore, they did foolish things on account of it.</p>
 <p>3. He really thought that the skin of his younger brother's head was off, while it was his younger brother's head's hair which had been shaved away.]</p>
