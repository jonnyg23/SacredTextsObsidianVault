 <h1 align="CENTER">DDI-XERRETEN, THE LIONESS, AND THE CHILDREN.</h1>
 <i></i><p>Ddi-Xerreten,<small>[1]</small> formerly, when the Lioness was at the water, dipping up,<small>[2]</small> (when) she had gone to dip<small>[3]</small></p>
 <p><small>[1. Their elder sister, the Vultures' elder sister.</small></p>
 <p>2. A man of the early race he was. His head was stone.</p>
 <p>3. I think that she probably dipped up water with a gemsbok's stomach; for she killed gemsbok.]</p>
 <p>up water there, <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> felt that the Lioness was the one who had gathered together the people's children, because the Lioness felt that she was an invalid on account of (her) chest; therefore, she gathered together the people's children, that the children might live with her, that the children might work for her; for, she was an invalid, and she could not do hard work.</p>
 <p>Therefore, <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> went to her house, when she was dipping up water. <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> went in her absence to the house, <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> went to the children, at the house. <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> went to the house reaching the children. <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> sat down. And <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> said: "O children sitting here! The fire of your people is that which is at the top of the ravine which comes down from the top (of the hill)." Therefore, two children arose, they went away to their own people.</p>
 <i></i><p>Dai-Xerreten again said: "O children sitting here! The fire of your people is that which is below the top of the ravine which comes down on this side (of the hill)." And three children<small>[1]</small> thus went, while they went away to their own people.</p>
 <p>And he again said: "O little child sitting here! Thy people's fire is that which is below the top of the ravine which comes down on this side (of the hill)." And the child arose, it thus went, while the child went away to its own people.</p>
 <p>He again said: "O children sitting here! The fire of your people is that which is below<small>[2]</small> the top</p>
 <p><small>[1. Literally, "children which became three."</small></p>
 <p>2. because the house is in the ravine (i.e., not where the water flows, but among the bushes).]</p>
 <p>of the ravine<small>[1]</small> which comes down on this side (of the hill)." And two children arose, they thus went away, while they went away to their own people.</p>
 <p>And he again said: "O children sitting here! Your people's fire is that which is at the top. of the ravine which comes down from the top (of the hill)." And two children arose, they thus went away.</p>
 <p>And he again said: "O children sitting here! The fire of your people is that which is at the top of the ravine which comes down from the top (of the hill)." And three children arose, they thus went away; while they went away to their own people.</p>
 <p>And he again said: "O children sitting here!<small>[2]</small> The fire of your people is that which is at the top of the ravine which comes down from the top (of the hill)." And two children arose, they thus went away; while they went away to their own people; while <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> sat waiting for the Lioness.</p>
 <p>And the Lioness came from the water, she thus returning came. She came along looking (at the house); she did not perceive the children. And she exclaimed: "Why do the children (stammering with rage) children children children, the children not do so to me? and the children do not play here, as they are wont to do? It must be this man who sits at the house; his head resembles <i>Dai-Xerreten</i>."<small>[3]</small></p>
 <p>And she became angry about it, when she perceived</p>
 <p><small>[1. He speaks of another ravine.</small></p>
 <p>2. Her children were not there; for the people's children were those whom she had.</p>
 <p>3. She recognized him.]</p>
 <i></i><p>Dai-Xerreten.<small>[1]</small> She exclaimed: "<i>Dai-Xerreten</i> indeed (?) sits here!" She walked up to the house. She exclaimed: "Where are my children?"<small>[2]</small> And <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> said: Our children (they) are not." And the Lioness exclaimed: "Out on thee! leave off! thou must give me the children!" <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> said: "Our children (they) were not."</p>
 <p>And the Lioness caught hold of his head. She exclaimed: "<i>Xabbabbu</i>"<small>[3]</small> (growling) to the other one's head. And she exclaimed: "Oh! Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! my teeth! This must be why this cursed(?) man's big head came to sit in front of my house!" While <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> said: "I told thee that our children they were not." The Lioness exclaimed: "Destruction! Thou hast been the one whose big head came to sit (here)." Our children<small>[4]</small> (they) were not."</p>
 <p>And he arose, he returned (home); while the Lioness sat in anger at her house; because he had come (and) taken away from her the children, who had been (living) peacefully with her; for she felt that she had done well towards the children; she did not a little love the children while she was doing so.</p>
 <p><small>[1. Because she did not perceive the children.</small></p>
 <p>2. The narrator's translation of <i>|ne |auwaki !kauken</i> was "Where are my children?" but "Give me the children" or "Show me the children" may be verbally more accurate.</p>
 <p>3. Growling put in the head.</p>
 <p>4. <i>Dai-Xerreten</i> was the one who spoke thus.]</p>
