 <h1 align="CENTER">THE SONG OF THE CAAMA FOX.</h1>
 <p>Crosser of the Spoor, Crosser of the Spoor,<small>[1]</small><br>
 Crosser of the Spoor, Crosser of the Spoor!</p>
 <p><small>[1. The Caama Fox is called "Crosser of the Spoor", because it avoids the dog nicely when the dog chases it, and, turning suddenly, runs back, crossing the dog's spoor (behind it), while the dog is racing on in front, thinking to catch the Caama Fox by so doing.]</small></p>
 <p>Cross the Caama Fox's spoor,<br>
 Cross the Caama Fox's spoor!<small>[1]</small></p>
 <p>Cross the Caama Fox's spoor,<br>
 Cross the Caama Fox's spoor!</p>
 <p><small>[1. It sings that the dog appears to think that he will kill it; but the dog will not kill it; for it is the one who crosses the spoor of (another) Caamaa Fox. It is the one which that dog will not kill; for the dog is the one who will nearly(?) die of fatigue, when it (the Caama Fox) has gone to lie peacefully in the shade; while it does not feel tired; while the dog painfully goes back to his master.]</small></p>
