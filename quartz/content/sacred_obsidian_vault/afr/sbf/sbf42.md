 <h1 align="CENTER">DOINGS OF THE SPRINGBOK.</h1>
 <p>The mother springbok is wont to do thus, as she trots along, when she has a springbok kid which is little, she grunts,<small>[1]</small> as she trots along; she says-- "<i>a, a, a</i>" <small>[2]</small> as she trots along. Therefore they (the springbok) make a resounding noise(?), because they are numerous; while the springbok kids also cry (bleat), while their mothers cry (grunt). Their mothers say--"<i>a, a, a,</i>" the springbok kids say-</p>
 <p><small>[1. Because she protectingly takes along the child, she grunts, as the child plays.</small></p>
 <p>2. Here the narrator made a grunting noise which, he said, was "in his throat"; and about which he remarked--"When I sit imitating the springbok, then I cough, on account of it."]</p>
 <p>"<i>me, me, me,</i>" while their mothers say "<i>a, a, a,</i>" as they grunt. The springbok children say "<i>me, me, me,</i>" while their mothers say "<i>a, a, a,</i>" as they grunting go forward.</p>
 <p>Therefore,<small>[1]</small> we are wont to say--"O beast of prey! thou art the one who hearest the place behind, it is resonant with sound. Therefore, I said that I would sit here. For these male springbok which stand around, are those which will go along, passing behind you; because I am lying down, and they do not perceive me; they will have to (?) go along, passing behind you, when ye have gone behind (the hill); they will have to (?) go along, passing behind you."</p>
 <p><small>[1. Therefore, the Bushmen are wont to say: "O beast of prey! it (the herd of springbok) seems as if it will arise; for thou art the one who seest the springbok's children. For thou art the one who seest (that) the springbok's children seem as if (they) would arise." (They had been lying down, or, as the narrator expressed it, "sitting.")]</small></p>
