 <h1 align="CENTER">DOINGS AND PRAYERS WHEN CANOPUS AND SIRIUS COME OUT.</h1>
 <p>The Bushmen perceive Canopus, they say to a child: "Give me yonder piece of wood, that I may put (the end of) it (in the fire), that I may point (it) burning (towards) grandmother, for, grandmother carries Bushman rice; grandmother shall make a little warmth for us; for she coldly comes out; the sun<small>[1]</small> shall warm grandmother's eye for us."</p>
 <p>Sirius comes out; the people call out to one another: Sirius comes yonder; they say to one another Ye must burn (a stick) for us (towards) Sirius." They say to one another: "Who was it who saw Sirius?" One man says to the other: "Our brother saw Sirius." The other man says to him:</p>
 <p><small>[1. The sun is a little warm, when this star appears in winter.]</small></p>
 <p>I saw Sirius."<small>[1]</small> The other man says to him: "I wish thee to burn (a stick) for us (towards) Sirius; that the sun may shining come out for us; that Sirius may not coldly come out." The other man (the one who saw Sirius) says to his son: "Bring me the (small) piece of wood yonder, that I may put (the end of) it (in the fire), that I may burn (it) towards grandmother; that grandmother may ascend the sky, like the other one, Canopus."</p>
 <p>The child brings him the piece of wood, he (the father) holds (the end of) it in (the fire). He points (it) burning towards Sirius; he says that Sirius shall twinkle like Canopus. He sings; he sings (about) Canopus, he sings (about) Sirius; he points to them with fire,<small>[2]</small> that they may twinkle like each other. He throws fire at them. He covers himself up entirely (including his head) in (his) kaross and lies down.</p>
 <p>He arises, he sits down; while he does not again lie down; because he feels that he has worked, putting Sirius into the sun's warmth; so that Sirius may warmly come out.</p>
 <p>The women go out early to seek for Bushman rice; they walk, sunning their shoulder blades.<small>[3]</small></p>
 <p><small>[1. <i>||Ukoa-ggu,</i> "Canopus," and <i>!kuttau</i>, "Sirius," are both female stars, <i>||kabbo</i> says.</small></p>
 <p>2. With the stick that he had held in the fire, moving it up and down quickly.</p>
 <p>3. They take one arm out of their kaross, thereby exposing one shoulder blade to the sun.]</p>
