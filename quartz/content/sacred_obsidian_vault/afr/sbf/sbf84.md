And (he) saw the wood pigeons, and was water<small>[2]</small> And the wood pigeons saw the water, and settled upon the water's edge. And <i>|Xue</i> worked large grass, like reeds, and it took hold of a wood pigeon. And the wood pigeons came to drink (lit. to eat) water, and the grass came near, and bit the wood pigeon's bill, and the wood pigeon cried out; and the other wood pigeons flew away.</p>
 <p>And <i>|Xue</i> was <i>|Xue</i> and rose up, and took hold of the wood pigeon, and plucked out the wood pigeon's feathers, and put the wood pigeon's feathers in his head, and lay upon the ground. And the water vanished, and he was and put the wood pigeon's feathers in his head, and lay upon the ground. And (he) put the wood pigeon's body into the hot embers, and lay down.

And (he) was rubbing sticks (to make) fire<small>[4]</small>; and saw me, and died; and is not another person, but is my child, and is <i>|Xue</i>. For, I went (?) away to my country, and did not see my child; and to-day,</p>
