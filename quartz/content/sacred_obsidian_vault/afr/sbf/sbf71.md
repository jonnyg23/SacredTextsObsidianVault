 <h1 align="CENTER">THE ADHESIVE SUBSTANCE USED BY THE BUSHMEN IN MARKING ARROWS.</h1>
 <p>It is <i>|kwae</i><small>[1]</small>; it is <i>||kuarri</i> juice. It is like a pumpkin, it is round. Its juice is white; it is like water. Its juice is not a little white; its whiteness resembles milk. It is poison.</p>
 <p>We make an incision(?) (and) set it (the <i>||kuwarri</i>) down; and then we hold a tortoise (shell) underneath it; because we wish its juice to be upon the tortoise (shell), that we may make <i>||kuae</i> of it. And we warm (it) by the fire, making it hot; and we beat(?) it, when it is hot. Then, we beat(?), cooling it. And we take it up in this manner,<small>[2]</small> with a "Driedoorn" stick; we do in this manner to it, with the "Driedoorn" stick, as we make it round; while we think that we intend to make little springbok arrows.</p>
 <p><small>[1. The later spelling of this word has been followed in the translation, as probably more correct.</small></p>
 <p>2. The narrator here imitated the manner of taking lip the <i>|kwae</i> by means of rolling it upon a stick.]</p>
