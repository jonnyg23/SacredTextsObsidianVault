 <h1 align="CENTER">THE MARKING OF ARROWS.</h1>
 <p>The Bushmen are those who mark arrows,<small>[1]</small> while they wish that they may recognize the arrows, when they are shooting springbok at one place. And, when they are following the springbok spoor, when</p>
 <p><small>[1. All the arrows.]</small></p>
 <p>they are going along picking up the arrows they recognize the arrows. They say: "Thy arrow it seems to be, for, their mark is like this." Another man says: "Yes, my arrow is yonder." They again go to pick up this arrow. The other man says: "My arrow seems to be yonder; for their mark is like this."</p>
 <i></i><p>|kwae<small>[1]</small> is that with which they make the marks. They put <i>tto</i> into (it), and they pound the <i>tto</i> together with the <i>||kuae</i>; and the <i>||kuae</i> becomes red on account of it; then, they mark the arrows with it.</p>
 <p><small>[1. They (the farmers) call it "Harpis." (Probably harpuis, * * * "resin.")]</small></p>
