 <h1 align="CENTER">PREPARATION OF THE FEATHER BRUSHES USED IN SPRINGBOK HUNTING.<small>[1]</small></h1>
 <p>They roll the feather brushes, binding the ostrich feathers (the body feathers) upon the "Driedoorn" stick. They become numerous; and they (the Bushmen) pound red stones,<small>[2]</small> they paint<small>[3]</small>, the feather brush sticks. And they make ready the (dried) skin of a springbok's chest; they thread little thongs<small>[4]</small></p>
 <p><small>[1. I used to see my grandfather (<i>Tsatsi</i>) roll the feather brushes.</small></p>
 <p>2. The red stones here meant, are <i>||ka</i>; not <i>tto</i>. At the "Philadelphia Exhibition," in November, 1875, <i>Dia!kwain</i> recognized red hæmatite as <i>||ka</i>.</p>
 <p>3. Paint them red.</p>
 <p>4. Thongs (they) are. The "children of thongs" (they) are. The Korannas call them <i>!Ya</i>.]</p>
 <p>into (it); and they put away the feather brushes. They put away the feather brushes; they dig <i>||kuain,</i><small>[1]</small> they roast (the stem of) the <i>||kuain</i>, they lay the feather brushes over the <i>||kuain</i>'s smoke, while the <i>||kuain</i>'s smoke ascends into the feather brushes.</p>
 <p>First, they dig<small>[2]</small> <small>[with a stick pointed with horn]</small>, making a little hole; they put live coals into it. And they put <i>||kuain</i> upon the live coals, while they wish that the <i>||kuain</i> may smoke quietly, and not flame up; for the <i>||kuain</i> would set the feather brushes on fire, if the fire were to flame up, if they (the stems) flamed up, when roasted.</p>
 <p>They (the Bushmen) put the springbok skin<small>[3]</small> over (the fire); they put a stone upon the place where the feather brush sticks are for they intend that the smoke should only go out through the ostrich feathers.</p>
 <p><small>[1. Its stem is that which the people call <i>||kuain</i>, because it does not a little smell. Therefore, the people smoke the feather brushes with it. The people call the stem of the <i>!Ywa-kau</i>, which is in the earth, <i>||kuain</i>.</small></p>
 <p>2. Men dig with sticks which have no stones (upon them); they are those with which men dig.</p>
 <p>3. They turn the skin, into which the feather brushes have been put, upside down, over the hole into which the live embers and the <i>||kuain</i> were put.]</p>
