 <h1 align="CENTER">TO BEAT THE GROUND (WITH A STONE).</h1>
 <p>The<i> !kung</i> beat a stone upon the ground. My father's mother beat a stone upon the ground. She said: "Fall into the water ! Fall into the water!" And the thing (the lightning?) fell into the water.</p>
 <p>A man does not beat a stone upon the ground. A woman beats a stone upon the ground.</p>
 <p>My (<i>Tamme</i>'s) father's mother was <i>Ng-||na</i>. My mother's father was Little <i>Tamme</i>; and my mother's mother was <i>!karo-||n'a</i>. My father's father's father was Great <i>Tamme</i>.</p>
