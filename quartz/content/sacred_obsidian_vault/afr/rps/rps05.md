 <p>The healing plough of the Repository Transplanted and rebuild your very soul and body without fail.</p>  
 <p>THE MISERY OF THE LAND IS HEALED BY FASTING. We pick you up from out of the midst of the raging misery of the land and HIDE you from the raging Wolves of the land into our Balm Yard.</p>  
 <p>What is a Balm yard? A balm yard is a Holy place that is wholly consecrated to God Almighty for the cleansing and healing of the Nations. Where the Holy Spirit of God ALONE is ALLOWED to do the Royal Work of Healing.</p>  
 <p>(Ques.) Who does the Balming work?<br> (Ans.) Consecrated men and women that the Holy Spirit moves, upon the Blazing Altar of their Souls, and endowed them with power that they command and handle the infirmities of the Nations.<br> (Ques) Have they any authority from God? (Ans) Yes, we are vessels of the Divine Honour!</p>  
 <p>(Ques) Have you any authority from the World?<br> (Ans) ASSUREDLY YES INDEED. The Copyright of Theocracy signs for our destiny and gave us His supreme Affidavit for a Trillion centuries after the end of Eternal Life.</p>
