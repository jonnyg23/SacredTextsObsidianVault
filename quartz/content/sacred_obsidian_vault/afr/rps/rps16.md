 <p>I am His Majesty King Alpha, The King of Kings, The Copyright of Creation, The First and The Last.<br> Blessed are they that SEARCHETH the DEEP THINGS ON THE TREE OF LIFE for my Wisdom is DEEP and is past finding Out.<br> Thus Saith the Living God, Owner of Life.<br> To Over Come White Bondage and filth and Black Hypocrisy, amongst your Own Black Skin, you HAVE TO FAST HARD.<br> For the white man is very filthy, and The Black man is an Hypocrite.</p>  
 <p>An Hypocrite means a crook, a filthy man is that class of White Folks that cuts with the Crook.<br> They are called black white.<br> Ye are the light and Salt of this and Other Worlds. Always have a BASIN of FINE OR COARSE SALT on your Fast TABLE as long as God is your RULER.</p>  
 <p>When you break your fast do not THROW the WATER over your heads, the trouble will fall on you.</p>  
 <p>When you are all ready, with your Cup in your hand, the ELDER WILL ASK "IS IT ALL WELL"!<br> Every body shall say together, "all is well with me". Then the Elder shall ask again, "who will bear a true witness for the: Tree of Life"?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>All shall say "by the Living God I will, God Helping Me, for Life". And The Leader, Shall say follow me with your Cup of Troubles, to the BURRYING PLACE of sin and shame.</p>  
 <p>Then Every Body walk quietly and RESPECTFULLY throw away the Water.</p>  
 <p>Then come in and wash your hands and face in a Basin of SALT AND WATER.<br> Then brake your real fast and be happy, feeling SATISFIED and REVIVED and Lovely.</p>  
 <p>House to House Fasting is very Powerful, it lifts the Work and REMOVES Devils from the Homes of those in DISTRESS.</p>  
 <p>Once Per week for the General Assembly is alright.<br> A LOVE Feast (Fast) every 3 or 6 months is NEEDED.</p>
