 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a></p> <h1 align="CENTER">Frogtown and Currytown</h1> 
 <p>Within the western limits of Savannah are Frogtown and Currytown, through which flows Musgrove Creek, narrow and sluggish, on its way from "Big Ogeechee" to the red Savannah River. These are two poor communities, as can be seen from the paintless little houses on dirt streets that often lack sidewalks. With the canal cutting the center of the district, there is scant space for gardens; but in spite of this, there are small patches of earth green with collards and turnips, and almost every "stoop" is decorated with a row of plants in tins of assorted dimensions.</p> 
 <p>During week days, with many persons away at work in other sections of the city, it is mostly the old who are found at home. Grandmothers and grandfathers "mind" the small children while the mothers work out.</p> 
 <p>One old woman, Anna Miller, <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a> had lived most of her youth on a Butler Island plantation, where some of the older workers had occupied the same cabins given to them before emancipation.</p> 
 <p>"Sebral ub dem hans wuz bery ole people," said Anna Miller. "Dey speak a funny language an none ub duh res ub us couldn hahdly unuhstan a wud dey say. Dey hab special name fuh all kine uh ting, but duh only ting I kin membuh is dat dey call a watuh bucket a 'juba haltuh'."</p> 
 <p>We found here, too, that in certain households certain foods are considered to bring bad luck.</p> 
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a></p> 
 <p>"I dohn eat peanuts," Millie McKen <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a> told us, "an I dohn let a soul in muh fambly eat em."</p> 
 <p>"Can you tell us why?" we queried, but she only shook her head.</p> 
 <p>"All I know is dat dey's bad luck. I foun dat out, an I wohn leh one come in muh house."</p> 
 <p>Handicraft objects in this section were more numerous than in many of the other communities. We found a most unusual brush <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">2</font></a> made from the palmetto. <a href="das26.htm#xref_45a"><font color="GREEN" size="1">45a</font></a> It was about four inches in length and two inches wide; both bristles and back had been made from a single piece of the rough fiber of the palmetto bark, spliced into splinters on one surface to form the bristles.</p> 
 <p>The work of two wood carvers was brought to our attention. One of the carvers <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">3</font></a> made a specialty of small wooden figures. He showed us several full length human figures, two or three busts mounted on square blocks of wood, and two oddly shaped objects, each with mask-like features carved on one surface. <a href="das26.htm#xref_41i"><font color="GREEN" size="1">41i</font></a> When we remarked on the originality of his work and its symmetry of design, he said simply, "I jis picked it up wen I wuzn wukin."</p> 
 <p>The other carver <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">4</font></a> had made several nondescript figures, but we were chiefly interested in two linked wooden chains. One of these, which had an attached box with a ball enclosed, was similar to a chain previously shown us by another man in the community. Each man had cut his chain with all its details from a single block of wood. <a href="das26.htm#xref_70f"><font color="GREEN" size="1">70f</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_70h"><font color="GREEN" size="1">70h</font></a></p> 
 <p>In Frogtown and Currytown there is intense interest shown in witches, spirits, and conjure. Personal experiences were related to us by several old residents, who had come in contact with supernatural elements.</p> 
 <p>Old Henry Gamble <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">5</font></a> told us that he has been accustomed to "seein tings" since childhood. Particularly on rainy nights ghosts appear to him. He said, "Sometimes dey float right at muh side. <a href="das26.htm#xref_59"><font color="GREEN" size="1">59</font></a> Ise use tuh um now an it's jis lak natchul people</p>

 <p>tuh me. Yuh kin skeah witches an ghos ef yuh make a cross mahk. Dis will stop um frum followin yuh."</p> 
 <p>Seventy-five year old Henry Bates <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a> readily acknowledged a belief in the supernatural. "I done seen all kine ub strange ting happen in muh lifetime. Yuh wahn me tuh tell yuh bout some uh dem ting, missus?</p> 
 <p>"One night I finished eatin dinnuh. Den I walk tuh duh kitchen doe. I see a strange man comin down duh road; he wuz twenty yahds away. I tun muh head tuh look in duh house an wen uh look back he done disappeahed. I know he mustuh been a ghos. <a href="das26.htm#xref_59"><font color="GREEN" size="1">59</font></a></p> 
 <p>"Anudduh time I heah a knock on duh doe. I heah it tree times. Bam! Bam! Bam! Wen muh dog heah dat knock, he holluh lak he wuz sked tuh det.

I strike a match an uh see a big yulluh cat walkin long side duh bed. It hab a face jis lak a pusson. It go right out duh winduh.</p> 
 <p>"I fine out latuh dat duh cat wuz a witch. <a href="das26.htm#xref_68"><font color="GREEN" size="1">68</font></a> Witches is jis livin people wut bin sole tuh duh debil.

 <p>"Wen I wuz a boy I heah lots uh stories bout people flyin. Some folks brung obuh frum Africa could fly off aw disappeah anytime dey wanted tuh. I alluz belieb dat story. I know folks right now dat kin make duh spirits uh dead people come back. <a href="das26.htm#xref_56"><font color="GREEN" size="1">56</font></a></p> 
 <p>"Wen I wuz jis growin up I knowd a boy dat hab a strange powuh. Eben ef he wuzn wid duh udduh boys he could tell each one wut he bin doin. <a href="das26.htm#xref_22a"><font color="GREEN" size="1">22a</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_22e"><font color="GREEN" size="1">22e</font></a> One day attuh we grown up he say dat he could bring back folks dat hab lef town an gone away.</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p> 
 <p>"Now deah wuz a uhmun whose huzbun hab lef uh. Dis uhmun wuz jis frettin uhsef tuh det. Muh frien go tuh uh an say 'I will cause yuh huzbun tuh come back tuh yuh. I will chahge yuh ten dolluhs. Yuh needn pay me till he come back but ef yuh dohn pay me den, he wohn stay.'</p> 
 <p>"In a week's time duh uhmun's huzbun wuz back. He stay home till he die. Duh uhmun pay muh frien in piece payments till she pay im duh ten dolluhs."</p> 
 <p>Living in a dirt lane on the fringe of Currytown is Chloe West <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">1</font></a> who was born at White Bluff and cannot remember her exact age. She told us that she frequently sees ghosts <a href="das26.htm#xref_59"><font color="GREEN" size="1">59</font></a> and that a spirit warns her when anything out of the ordinary is about to happen. <a href="das26.htm#xref_22a"><font color="GREEN" size="1">22a</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_22e"><font color="GREEN" size="1">22e</font></a></p> 
 <p>"One time I wuz; bodduhed by duh folks nex doe wut wuz tryin tuh cunjuh me. Somebody tell me tuh git some hot watuh an tro it wen I heah duh noise. Jis as I git duh watuh hot, duh spirit ub a wite uhmun I use tuh wuk fuh peahed an tell me tuh pray an duh witches would go way. Attuh she spoke, duh witches went out an nebuh did bodduh me since. Duh witches wuz two men. One ub um went crazy an duh poeleece foun duh udduh one out in duh woods. He died in duh po house.</p> 
 <p>"One night I heah a noise at muh winduh. A voice say, 'Chloe, dohn go neah duh winduh.' I stop a minute, den uh go tuh duh winduh. Some kine uh powduh wuz trone in muh face dat bline me. <a href="das26.htm#xref_8b"><font color="GREEN" size="1">8b</font></a> Den duh voice tell me tuh wash muh face quick in karisene.

 <p>

 <p>"Duh fus time I ebuh see ghos wuz long yeahs back. Once wen I wuz young an receivin compny, deah wuz two men comin tuh see me. I lak one man duh bes an duh udduh man wuz jealous. Well, duh jealous man die. Aftuh dat many a time uh see a shadduh lak him come right up tuh muh doe an disappeah. One night be come, stretch he ahm cross duh doe, an say jis as plain as anyting in a big loud voice, 'Is dat udduh man still comin roun yuh?' I wuz sked stiff."</p> 
 <p>D. C. Kelsey, <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">1</font></a> who has been blind for six years, told us that conjure had caused the loss of his sight.</p> 
 <p>"An I ain had duh money tuh git nobody tuh tun dis ting back on duh one dat put it on me," he complained.</p> 
 <p>He looked pleased when a piece of money was placed in his hand. When we asked why he blew on the coin, he smiled slowly. "Dat make mo luck. It'll hep me tuh git mo. Yuh know, a root man, he wohn take money out yuh ban. He tell yuh tuh put it on duh table aw duh shef."</p> 
 <p>We encouraged him to continue on the subject of root men.</p> 
 <p>"Dey kin fix yuh wid mos anyting," Kelsey said. "Duh chinch bug is use a lot an Ise sked ub em. I wouldn put muh han on dem ting fuh ten dolluhs. I hab a sistuh name Ida Walker wut wuz fix wid candy. She ate duh candy an den uh ahm swell up an tun blue. Yuh could see lill animals runnin up an down uh ahm. She got a root doctuh name Sherman.
