 <p>Huge, moss-hung oaks form a canopy and cast filigreed shadows upon the White Bluff Road, which passes directly through the quiet Negro community of White Bluff, eight miles southeast of Savannah.</p> 
 <p>Winding roads turn from the main highway and terminate in the various sections which form the settlement and which are known as Nicholsonboro, Rose Dhu, Twin Hill, and Cedar Grove. The sections east of the White Bluff Road are on the Vernon River. It is here that many of the inhabitants make their living by catching crab and fish which they sell in the city markets. West of the highway the narrow roads lead through thickly wooded areas of great beauty. Along these roads families have cleared small tracts and built their homes, reserving garden space for flowers and vegetables. In the summer wild crepe myrtle trees, with blossoms as luscious a red as the heart of the watermelon, contrast colorfully with the bright blue paint on the doors and trimmings of some of the houses.</p> 
 <p>The White Bluff Road, which for two miles forms the main street of the community, passes the houses of other residents set well back from the road. Most of them are small and unpretentious but well kept. At intervals of perhaps half a mile are three rural grocery stores; farther along is a whitewashed church with red and blue glass windows, and at the farthest extremity of the settlement is a similar but larger church.</p> 
 <p>The inhabitants, of which there are approximately four hundred, are deeply religious and lay great stress on being</p> 
 <p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "Christian people." Many of the older inhabitants were formerly slaves on a large plantation on St. Catherines Island. After the War between the States many of these Negroes moved to White Bluff, built their homes, reared their families, and have lived to see two generations reach maturity. With all their fervent Christian doctrines the old people have an unwavering faith in many of the beliefs taught them by their grandparents. A few remember their ancestors who were brought from Africa on slave ships.</p> 
 <p>The younger group seem carefree as they perform their tasks in the cool part of the morning. It is not unusual to see several young men lying on a shady porch resting or happily engaged in a card game as early as ten o'clock on a summer morning. These young people have little faith in the practices of their elders, but they believe profoundly in the power of certain charms to affect luck and love. <a href="das26.htm#xref_8"><font color="GREEN" size="1">8</font></a></p> 
 <p>Having heard that Sophie Davis was one of the oldest persons in the community, we visited her and found her cordial in her reception. Sophie <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a> does not know her exact age, but was eight at the time of the war. She is very short and very stout with gray hair and a very large smiling face. The day we saw her she wore a cotton print dress with gray predominating. Her sparkling eyes expressed her interest in current happenings of the community, and when she laughed, her eyes became mere slits and her shoulders shook.</p> 
 <p>Indicating a small bush growing beside the doorway of her little cabin, Sophie told us, "Some uh duh folks heah sho belieb in some queah tings. Yuh see dis lill bush--it call Cherokee an mos uh duh folks yuh plants it at duh doe. It bring um good luck. <a href="das26.htm#xref_34c"><font color="GREEN" size="1">34c</font></a> Lot uh medicine an cuos is made frum udduh roots and herbs an some uh duh folks uses um wen dey's sick." <a href="das26.htm#xref_48"><font color="GREEN" size="1">48</font></a></p> 
 <p>We inquired as to the kind of herbs used.</p> 
 <p>"Duh wite root," pointing to a wild shrub, "dey use fuh stomach troubles. Buttuh root an palmettuh root an May apple, yuh bile tuhgedduh wid a quawt uh watuh till it simmuh down tuh haf uh pint, den yuh add some cawn wisky. Dat a fambly tonic tuh buil yuh up."</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></a></p> 
 <p>Sophie went on to tell us something about the beliefs prevailing in the neighborhood. "Ef some relative is sick, yuh dohn nebuh deah tuh sew on a gahment wut yuh is weahin cuz dat put a spell on duh sick un an dey mos liable tuh die. <a href="das26.htm#xref_49"><font color="GREEN" size="1">49</font></a> Deah's anudduh ting too. Yuh sho bettuh not steal tings frum a grabe. <a href="das26.htm#xref_64"><font color="GREEN" size="1">64</font></a> I sho know I wouldn. Deah's jis a lot uh udduh tings bout bad luck too. One sho sign is dat ef a pusson sneeze wile dey's eatin long, dat is, dey hab food in dey mout, den dey got tuh put it out lessn dey hab bad luck. <a href="das26.htm#xref_52"><font color="GREEN" size="1">52</font></a> Anudduh sign is duh hootin ub a owl." <a href="das26.htm#xref_44"><font color="GREEN" size="1">44</font></a></p> 
 <p>A strange look of doubt and amusement came into Sophie's eyes at the mention of conjuring. She smiled and slowly shook her head.</p> 
 <p>"I heahd ub a few cases weah dey say one uh duh neighbuhs cunjuh anudduh, <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> but fuh duh mos paht dey all gits long all right. Das cuz we's all Christians an dohn put no faith much in dem kine uh tings. Dey say dat a powuhful chahm kin be made frum grabeyahd dut <a href="das26.htm#xref_9"><font color="GREEN" size="1">9</font></a> fuh cunjuhin puhposes, but duh pusson dat git duh dut mus put some pennies on duh grabe, else he hab trouble hissef. Nebuh let a enemy git any ub yuh haiah wut bin cut off aw yuh nail clippins. Ef he git deze he kin make sumpm dat will cause lot uh trouble. <a href="das26.htm#xref_10"><font color="GREEN" size="1">10</font></a> I kin tell yuh sumpm else bout duh haiah too. Ef a bud gits duh haiah, yuh'll hab a headache soon.</p> 
 <p>"Now Uncle John Bowen on St. Catherines he wuz a root man an one time a man come tuh him tuh git somebody fix. Uncle John he wuz fixin tings tuh linguh um, an duh man sit on duh cheah weah he hab duh cunjuh tings an Uncle John he git so mad he git right up an fix duh cunjuh right now so dat man wut awduh duh fixin die hesef. He fix lot uh people. Deah so much debilment in ole Uncle John Bowen dat finally he eat out hesef till he fix hesef an die." We asked about the use of drums.</p> 
 <p>"Yes'm, dey alluz use tuh beat duh drum wen somebody die tuh let duh udduh folks know bout duh det. An at fewnuls too, dey beat it."</p> 
 <p>Relative to spirits, she replied, "No'm, I caahn see spirits cuz I ain bawn wid a caul. But now Bob Delegal he knows spirits. Down on Blackbeard Ilun, deah wuz a big hawg wut wuz a ebil spirit. Dey call um Blackbeard an dey try an try</p> 
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></a></p> 
 <p>tuh kill um. So ole Bob Delegal cut up some silbuh an put it in he gun. He aim at duh hawg but he miss um an ole Bob Delegal fall down an couldn speak. Dey carry um home an he nebuh did talk no mo, an duh nex day he die."</p> 
 <p>According to Sophie the old people on St. Catherines would pray at the rising and at the setting of the sun and at the conclusion of their prayers they would say the words "Meena, Mina, Mo." Asked if she knew the meaning of these words, she shook her head negatively.</p> 
 <p>"Yuh know, Susie Branch, who lib jis cross duh road deah, could tell yuh some uh deze tings too. We wuz chillun tuhgedduh down on St. Catherines Ilun. I gwine call uh."</p> 
 <p>In a moment Susie <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">1</font></a> arrived. Tall and thin, she was dressed in a red, green, and blue cotton plaid skirt and a man's shirt with the tail hanging loosely outside. She was very talkative and was enthusiastic in verifying many of the things that Sophie had mentioned.</p> 
 <p>Susie listened gravely as we inquired about her recollections of the old people in her family. She told us the following story: "Dey steal muh great-great-gran, uh name wuz Sukey, frum off duh beach in Africa wen she wuz a young miss. I dunno wut paht ub Africa she come frum. She alluz say she come frum Africa, duh country weah dey dohn weah no cloze. At duh plantation at St. Catherines she wuz duh seamstress fuh duh slabes. She make mos all dey weah."</p> 
 <p>When we asked her if she ever heard that dreaming about a snake "meant anything," the old woman replied, "Yes, ma'am, dat mean yuh got a enemy. <a href="das26.htm#xref_51"><font color="GREEN" size="1">51</font></a> Not many nights ago I dream bout a snake an uh sho wuz sked wen uh wake up."</p> 
 <p>They both laughed and Susie leaned over and tapped Sophie on the arm and said, "Oh yes, deah's lots uh dem tings bout babies. Wen dey bawn wid a caul, das sho a sign dey will be bery wise an kin talk wid duh spirits. <a href="das26.htm#xref_4"><font color="GREEN" size="1">4</font></a> Ain dasso, Sophie?"</p> 
 <p>Agreeing, Sophie hastened to add what she had heard about babies born with teeth. "Dey will hab bad luck all deah libes. <a href="das26.htm#xref_66"><font color="GREEN" size="1">66</font></a> Dat sho wuk out. Deah wuz one boy bawn dat way wut lib right yuh in Wite Bluff an he wine up by bein in duh chain-gang an dat sho nuff bad luck."</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></a></p> 
 <p>"But dis lill plant heah called 'Cherokee' is spose tuh bring good luck ef yuh plants it by duh front doe step" <a href="das26.htm#xref_34c"><font color="GREEN" size="1">34c</font></a> said Susie.</p> 
 <p>In this community as in many others strangers are not allowed to be buried in the local cemetery but in what is known as the "strangers lot," a piece of ground set apart from the cemetery proper. The custom of bringing the dead back to their original home for interment is also prevalent throughout coastal Georgia. The body of a young man who recently died in New York was brought back to White Bluff for burial. Relative to this custom, Susie spoke quietly. "Dey alluz brings um back tuh bury um ef dey kin git duh money, cuz yuh see duh spirit'll jis wanduh roun an nebuh be satisfied lessn it brung back home tuh be buried."'</p> 
 <p>I know Lunnon Grayson know all bout dem tings too. Yuh tun off tuh duh lef at duh fus road leadin off frum duh highway yuh. Ax anybody den, an dey'll tell yuh wich is his house. He use tuh lib on St. Catherines too, but he come up yuh long fo me an Susie," Sophie said.</p> 
 <p>Lunnon <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">1</font></a> remembered a great deal about the old customs. Seated in his front yard under the shade of a crepe myrtle tree, he and Prince Sneed were chatting. Lunnon's hair was snow white and wooly. On his left ear was a gold earring, which he claimed tended to improve his eyesight. <a href="das26.htm#xref_27"><font color="GREEN" size="1">27</font></a> When he laughed he bent double and slapped his knees with his bands; at the same time his mouth opened wide, revealing his three remaining teeth. At first he was reluctant to admit that he had heard much about conjuring. He finally admitted, between chuckles, that be had heard about it from his mother and grandmother but vehemently denied any belief in conjure himself. He was serious, however, as he told the following story about Prince Sneed's father-in-law, who was being conjured at the time.</p> 
 <p>"I lib in White Bluff fuh bout fifty yeahs, an I kin tell yuh many stories I heahd bout cunjuhin an root doctuhs. Somebody heahbouts put an ebil spell on Prince Sneed's fathuh-in-law, Lunnon Milton. <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> He seem tuh git wus an wus an nuttn seem tuh hep him none. Finally he sen fuh a root doctuh an</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></a></p> 
 <p>he wuk obuh im. but he dohn git no bettuh. <a href="das26.htm#xref_48"><font color="GREEN" size="1">48</font></a> He call in eight ub um altuhgedduh, but dey dohn seem able tuh countuhrack dat cunjuh. <a href="das26.htm#xref_6"><font color="GREEN" size="1">6</font></a> Duh ole man sick tuh dis day. Maybe some day he fine a root doctuh wut is powful nuff tuh hep him." <a href="das26.htm#xref_48"><font color="GREEN" size="1">48</font></a></p> 
 <p>As Uncle Lunnon finished his story, Prince Sneed, <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">1</font></a> a dark man of splendid physique despite his sixty-odd years, added, "It's lak dis. Wen Ise sick, I gonuh see a doctuh right away. Now muh faduh-in-law, he jis keep on wid dem root doctuhs, but he say he ain gittin a bit bettuh."</p> 
 <p>Prince proved to be an interesting talker, much of his knowledge having been gleaned from conversations by the fireside with his grandfather. The following narrative was still fresh in his memory:</p> 
 <p>"Muh gran say ole man Waldburg down on St. Catherine own some slabes wut wuzn climatize an he wuk um hahd an one day dey wuz hoein in duh fiel an duh dribuh come out an two ub um wuz unuh a tree in duh shade, an duh hoes wuz wukin by demsef. Duh dribuh say 'Wut dis?' an dey say, 'Kum buba yali kuni buba tambe, Kum kunka yali kum kunka tambe,' quick like. Den dey rise off duh groun an fly away. Nobody ebuh see um no mo. Some say dey fly back tuh Africa. Muh gran see dat wid he own eye."</p> 
 <p>He had heard that on Blackbeard Island it was customary in the old days for a group of men to agree upon a location in which to bury their money, whereupon one of them would voluntarily offer his life and be put to death at the hands of the others, thereby enabling his spirit to stand guard and protect the treasure.</p> 
 <p>"I seen a spirit muhsef once wen I wuz a young man," Prince continued. "It wuz late in duh aftuhnoon. I wuz cookin crab an uh look up an see a man widout a head. I look away, den uh look back tuh weah uh see im, an sho nuff deah he is in plain sight. I rush tuh duh house an staht tuh tell muh fostuh mudduh but she stop me. She dohn wahn me tuh talk bout it. Den duh nex day she ax me wut uh see an fix me sumpm tuh drink an I nebuh did see no mo spirit."</p> 
 <p>Another woman in the community, Bessie Royal, <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">2</font></a> in relation</p> 
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></a></p> 
 <p>to her belief in witchcraft and conjure said, "Lots uh people roun yuh say dat hags ride um at night. <a href="das26.htm#xref_69"><font color="GREEN" size="1">69</font></a> None ub um ebuh bodduhed me. Dey say dat duh hags is libe folks wut hab duh powuh tuh change demsefs intuh animals an insecs an any udduh ting dey want tuh be. <a href="das26.htm#xref_68"><font color="GREEN" size="1">68</font></a></p> 
 <p>"I dohn know how it wuz done but muh faduh wuz cunjuhed <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> by a suttn uhmun dat wuz said to be a hag. <a href="das26.htm#xref_69"><font color="GREEN" size="1">69</font></a> He go crazy sometimes an ack lak he wuz sked by sumpm chasin im. He git wus and dey take im tuh a root doctuh. Duh root doctuh say he wuz cunjuhed. He hab us ketch a wite chicken wich he split open wile duh chicken wuz; still libe. He place dis chicken, blood an all wile it wuz still wome, on top uh muh faduh head an boun it deah.</p> 
 <p>"Well, muh faduh git bettuh fuh a wile. Den all at once he hab anudduh attack an he die befo duh doctuh could git tuh im. Attuh dis I belieb in cunjuh mo dan ebuh."</p> 
 <p>Later that same day we visited a small Negro cabin set deep in the woods some distance from the highway. Here lived Serina Hall, <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a> born eighty-eight years ago on St. Catherines Island and a former slave of Jacob Waldburg. She said that when she was a small child her master had brought the members of her family to Savannah to be employed as house servants.</p> 
 <p>The old woman at first disclaimed any knowledge of conjure or the existence of supernatural creatures. After a time, however, her attitude changed and she launched into a lengthy discussion of the current beliefs.</p> 
 <p>"I dohn lak tuh talk bout dem tings," she began, "but I hab tuh belieb wut muh eyes see. I membuh once a man uh knew well got kill. Attuh he wuz buried his spirit use tuh folluh me all duh time. I feel a heat come tuh me, den uh look roun, an deah a shadduh ub a man pass by. I ax duh spirit, 'Wut you want?' Den it leab me lone an I ain seen dat spirit sence." <a href="das26.htm#xref_56"><font color="GREEN" size="1">56</font></a>,  <a href="das26.htm#xref_59"><font color="GREEN" size="1">59</font></a></p> 
 <p>We asked Serina if she had ever known any conjure workers and she said, "Witches an root men is duh same ting. Dey kin tun demsefs intuh any shape, a insec, a cat, aw a dog, aw any kine uh animal. <a href="das26.htm#xref_68"><font color="GREEN" size="1">68</font></a> Dey kin go tru any kine uh hole tuh git at yuh.</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></a></p> 
 <p>"Tub tun intuh sumpm else dey hab tuh hab duh powuh tuh take off deah skin. I heahd bout somebody watchin a hag take off is skin. He git some salt an peppuh an rub it on duh skin. <a href="das26.htm#xref_69a"><font color="GREEN" size="1">69a</font></a> Wen duh hag go tuh put is skin back on, duh salt an peppuh bun so he couldn git it on. Duh folks wuz able tuh ketch im an dey fine it wuz one uh deah neighbuhs. He beg an plead an so dey fuhgib im. Dey nebuh hab no mo hag ridin. <a href="das26.htm#xref_69"><font color="GREEN" size="1">69</font></a></p> 
 <p>"Muh ma tell me many times bout a man an his wife wut could wuk cunjuh. <a href="das26.htm#xref_48"><font color="GREEN" size="1">48</font></a> Anytime dey want tuh dey would fly back tuh Africa an den come back agen tuh duh plantation. Dey come back cuz dey hab some chillun wut didn hab duh powuh tuh fly an hab tuh stay on duh plantation. One ub duh daughtuhs wanted tuh lun tuh fly an wuk cunjuh. Duh faduh tell uh she hab tuh lun duh passwud, den she hab tuh kill a man by cunjuh. <a href="das26.htm#xref_15"><font color="GREEN" size="1">15</font></a> Attuh dis den she would hab duh powuh. Duh magic passwud mean sumpm like dis, 'Who loss duh key Branzobo?'"</p>
