 <p>
 This is an afrocentric re-examination of Greek philosophy,
 posing the thesis that it was, in plain, stolen from Egypt
 (<i>i.e.</i>, Africa).
 James' theory is that classical Greek philosophy was derived from an
 Ancient Egyptian mystery tradition, possibly concealing advanced
 scientific knowledge that the Greeks misinterpreted.
 James' approach to the topic is informed by a wide
 range of authorities, some <a href="../../cla/index.htm">classic</a>, others a bit more <a href="../../eso/index.htm">esoteric</a>.
 He makes some startling claims, <i>e.g.</i>, that Alexander the
 Great and <a href="../../cla/ari/index.htm">Aristotle</a>
 plundered hundreds of books from the Great Library
 of Alexandria, which were later attributed to Aristotle.
 He is dead serious about this perceived slight by the Greeks,
 and even exhorts us to boycott Greek letter fraternities.
 </p>
 <p>
 Pioneers of the afrocentrism movement, such
 as James, and <a href="../we/index.htm">Drusilla Houston</a>,
 labored in obscurity outside the mainstream.
 They were precursors of later 20th century writers
 such as Cheikh Anta Diop, who advanced very similar ideas,
 albeit on a broader front.
 Today, the substantial contribution of Africans to world civilization
 is better known.
 These books are milestones on the path towards this understanding.

 <small>Production notes:
 For once, I'd say that the original book could have used a bit more footnotes.
 The blocks of references interspersed with the text, and his tendency to
 use 'N.B.' as a standalone paragraph,
 make it look like a set of reading notes.
 The outlining is not indented in a consistent fashion, and the
 deeply nested numbering of sub-sections and items is also apparently ad-hoc.
 However, as is the practice, I have preserved the original text as closely
 as possible.
 Lastly, I didn't attempt to check the spelling
 of the more obscure personal names in this, and, given the number of
 <a href="errata.htm">other typos</a> in the book, there may be a
 number of them--<i>J.B. Hare, September 23rd, 2008</i></small>.
