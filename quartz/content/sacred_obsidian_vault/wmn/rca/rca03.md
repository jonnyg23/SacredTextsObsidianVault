 <h3 align="CENTER">THE GREAT MOTHER</h3>
 <p>More primitive than the worship of the gods under anthropomorphic form is the custom of reverencing this or that deity in baetylic or aniconic shape, a habit of religious cult for which there is ample evidence in the writings and monuments of the Greeks. This evidence, however, usually indicates such worship only in very early times, showing that it gave place here and there to a more highly developed stage, that of iconic symbolism, but there are examples of this primitive conception of deity in late times. Conspicuous among these survivals is the worship of Cybele under the form of the Black Stone of Pessinus in Phrygia. By order of the Sibylline books the cult was transplanted to Rome, in 204 B.C., as a means of driving Hannibal out of Italy. <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">65</font></a></p>
 <p>Apollonius <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">66</font></a> represents the Amazons engaged in ritual exactly similar to that of Pessinus--venerating a black stone placed on an altar in an open temple situated on an island off the coast of Colchis. The character of the worship which he depicts makes it probable that he drew his information on this point from an early source, especially since we learn from Diodorus <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">67</font></a> that the Amazons paid marked honour to the Mother of the Gods, consecrating to her the island of Samothrace, setting up her altars there, and performing magnificent</p>

 <p>sacrifices. At any rate, the two passages substantiate the fact that the Amazons were votaries of the Mother, who was known both as Rhea and as Cybele.</p>
 <p>One story <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a> told that Scamander introduced the rites of the Cretan Mother into Phrygia, and that they were firmly established at Pessinus on the Sangarius as a chief centre, where the goddess received from the mountain ridge overhanging the city the well-known name, Dindymene; <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a> another account <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">70</font></a> had it that the home of Phrygian Cybele's worship was in Samothrace, whence Dardanus brought the cult to Phrygia; an attempt to rationalise the two legends developed the tale <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">71</font></a> that Corybas of Samothrace, son of Demeter and Jasion, introduced the rites of his mother into Phrygia, and that his successors, the Corybantes of Mount Ida in the Troad, passed over to the Cretan mountain of the same name, in order to educate the infant Zeus. In the minds of the various writers of antiquity to whom we are indebted for all that we know about orgiastic cults there is such confusion that we are left in ignorance of accurate details which would serve to distinguish sharply one cult from another.</p>
 <p>We are informed on several points, however, concerning the worship of Cybele, the Great Mother of Phrygia, considered apart from other cults similar in character and expression. Her worship at Pessinus in particular is most important to an inquiry concerning the Amazons, because there, attested by history, was the same baetylic form of the goddess under which the Amazons were said to have venerated her. Roman writers naturally, after the Black Stone had been set up in their city, were moved by interest and curiosity to examine the legends connected with the cult, and so it</p>

 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 19</font></a></p>
 <p>happens that to these sources we owe many facts, often gleaned from the poets of the early Empire who looked with disgust on the great vogue of this orgiastic cult in their day. Cybele of Pessinus was served by eunuch priests called Galli. <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">72</font></a> This office of priesthood, which was considered very honourable, seems to have commemorated the devotion of Atys to the goddess. Fortunately we have a record <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">73</font></a> of the peculiar form which the legend of Atys assumed at Pessinus. Here he was regarded as the son of a maiden by the fruit of an almond-tree, which sprang from the bi-sexual Agdistis. Agdistis <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a> loved him and made him her <i>paredros</i> and Gallus. From the same source, Pausanias, we learn the Lydian variant of the story. <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a> In this he is called the son of Calaüs of Phrygia. He established the orgies of the Mother in Lydia, in connection with which he was so loved by the goddess that Zeus in jealousy sent a wild boar into the fields of Lydia, which killed Atys. Both versions show that the youth held in Cybele's mysteries a position similar to that of Adonis with Aphrodite and of Osiris with Isis, <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a> but it seems to have been the peculiar characteristic of the cult of Cybele that her companion was a Gallus. The fact which stands out conspicuously in all the records of the Pessinuntian rites is the service of effeminate priests, <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">77</font></a> who apparently represent him. In this there is</p>

 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 20</font></a></p>
 <p>probably a clue to the connection between Cretan Rhea and Phrygian Cybele, for in the two sets of cult legends there is frequent mention of the Dactyli, who belong both to Cretan and Trojan Ida. <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">78</font></a> Their evident association with metallurgy recalls the iron sickle produced by Gaea and given to Cronus to accomplish the overthrow of Uranus. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a></p>
 <p>The underlying idea in the cult of Cybele seems to have been that of an earth-goddess of fertility in man, beast, and field. Her worship was accompanied by the sound of crashing drums and cymbals, the music of the pipe, and the voices of frenzied votaries. Of her inspiration came a form of holy madness, which endowed the worshipper with a sense of mystic ecstasy and supernatural strength. The best extant description of the rites is that given by Lucretius, <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a> which, although it is marred by the allegorising tendency of the poet's thought, conveys an excellent impression of the tumultuous festival. The most awe-inspiring detail of the ceremonies is that beneath the joy of the throng's self-surrender to the deity there is a terrific undertone like that of the muttering drums. The fervour of rejoicing may in a moment become the curse of irresistible madness sent by the Mother. It is a presage of the mourning in the Atys of Catullus: <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a></p><dir>

 <p><font size="-1">Dea Magna, Dea Cybele, Dindymi Dea, Domina,<br>

 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 21</font></a></p>
 <p>Ancient notices speak of other priests of Cybele, less important than the Galli. These were the Cybebi and Metragyrtae, <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">82</font></a> mendicant friars, whose machinations at Rome were scorned by Juvenal. <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">83</font></a></p>
 <p>In the cult legends the Galli of history are probably represented by the Corybantes, about whom there is much confusion. At times they seem to belong only to Cybele's rites, at other times they are completely identified with the Curetes. Probably the tales of Corybantes and Curetes preserve the record of primitive armed dances of religious character, in honour of Phrygian Cybele and Cretan Rhea respectively. As the two deities are essentially the same, <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">84</font></a> so the hoplite attendants of the one are practically the same as those of the other. As each cult assumed local individuality, the myths concerning the Corybantes would gradually appear to be quite distinct from those about the Curetes. Naturally, only an initiate in the mysteries attached to either cult would possess accurate information on details, and his lips would be inevitably sealed on all important points, so that posterity must be content to remain puzzled by remarks like this of Pausanias: <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">85</font></a> "In lineage the Corybantes are different from the Curetes, but, although I know the truth about both, I pass it over." Unfortunately certain writings by Epimenides <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">86</font></a> which might have proved highly satisfactory to modern</p>

 <p>inquiry have perished. In the actual ceremonies performed at Cybele's shrines the original warlike character <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">87</font></a> was almost lost in the mystic frenzy which found expression in noisy shouting and self-affliction, but it is doubtless to be traced in the measured beating of drums, the clashing of cymbals, and the music of the pipe, which set the rhythm for the ecstatic motions of the worshippers. It was expressed also in the political and warlike aspect of the goddess thus adored. <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">88</font></a> The Cretan legends told that the Phrygian Corybantes were summoned to the island, where by beating their shields with their swords they drowned the cries of the new-born Zeus from the ears of his jealous father, and so originated the Pyrrhic dance in which the later Curetes honoured Rhea, by moving to and fro in measured time, nodding their crested helmets, and striking their shields. <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a></p>
 <p>The Curetes are, moreover, confounded with the Dactyli, who are usually given as five in number,--Heracles, Paeonius, Epimedes, Jasion, and Idas, <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">90</font></a>--the metallurgists of Cretan and</p>

 <p>Trojan Ida, also with the mysterious Ἄνακτες παῖδες, who are either the Dioscuri or the Cabiri. <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a> Idas is the name, not only of a Curete, but likewise of one of the Messenian rivals and counterparts of the Spartan Διόσκουροι; <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a> Jasion is the name of the mortal whom Demeter loved in Crete, <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">93</font></a> and who with her belongs to the mysteries of Samothrace; the Dactyl Heracles, whom Pausanias <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">94</font></a> carefully distinguishes from Alcmena's son, is by this writer <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">95</font></a> very cleverly identified with the deity of this name worshipped at Erythrae in Ionia, at Tyre, and even at Mycalessus in Boeotia. The Cabiri, being confounded with the Dactyli, are brought into close relation to the Curetes. On the other hand, they are confused with the Corybantes through Corybas, son of Jasion and Demeter, who was said to have introduced his mother's worship into Phrygia from Samothrace. <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">96</font></a></p>
 <p>Of the Cabiric mysteries very little can be said with certainty, except that Demeter was here revered as the mother of Plutus by Jasion. Herodotus, <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">97</font></a> himself an initiate, believes the mysteries of Samothrace to be of Pelasgic origin. He hints at a connection between these rites and the Pelasgians' introducing herms at Athens. Furthermore, he describes <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">98</font></a> the type under which the Cabiri were portrayed in plastic art, that of a pygmy man, precisely like the <i>pataïci</i>, or grotesque figure-heads which the Phoenician triremes carried. Excavations at the Cabirium in Thebes have yielded a unique class of vases which confirm his statement. <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">99</font></a> Their chief interest,</p>

 <p>apart from the peculiarities of technique, is in the frank caricature shown in the painted figures. The scenes are chiefly Dionysiac in character, from which it is to be inferred that the Theban Cabirus was a form of Dionysus, but this hardly agrees with the words of Pausanias, <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">100</font></a> who uses the plural number of the Cabiri at Thebes. He says that he is not at liberty to reveal anything about them, nor about the acts which were performed there in honour of the Mother, that he can only say that there was once a city on this spot, that there were certain men called Cabiri, among whom were Prometheus and his son, Aetnaeus, and that the mysteries were given by Demeter to the Cabiri. This account favours Welcker's theory <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">101</font></a> that the Cabiri were the "Burners." In this capacity they would approach closely to the Dactyli. But they are not for this reason necessarily divorced from companionship with Dionysus, whom Pindar <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">102</font></a> calls the <i>paredros</i> of Demeter: Χαλκοκρότου πάρεδρον Δημήτερος. The epithet Χαλκοκρότου shows the intimate bond between Demeter and the Mother of the Gods. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a> Dionysus is placed naturally at the side of the former, since his worship, in cult and in legend, is to be classed with that of the Great Mother of Phrygia, Rhea's double. <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">104</font></a> Demeter is indeed, the Earth-Mother of Greece, on whose cult ideas were grafted which</p>

 <p>belonged to the ceremonial of the Mother in Phrygia and Lydia. <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a></p>
 <p>So it is not strange that the Samothracian goddess closely approximates the form of Cybele, and that we find the Amazons consecrating this island to the Mother of the Gods. <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a> But there is room for much conjecture concerning the meaning of the connection between the Amazons and the deity of Samothrace. <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a> It is probable that there is some bearing on this in the legend of the settlement of Samothrace recorded by Pausanias. <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">108</font></a> This tells that the people of Samos, driven out by Androclus and the Ephesians, fled to this island, and named it Samothrace in place of the older name, Dardania. The charge which Androclus had brought against the Samian exiles was that they had joined the Carians in plotting against the Ionians. It would appear then that these colonists of Samothrace were bound by strong ties, probably of blood, to the pre-Ionic population of Ephesus and its environs, by whom the shrine of Ephesian Artemis was founded, a shrine indissolubly connected with the Amazon tradition. <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">109</font></a> With these facts must be considered the opinion of Herodotus that the Samothracian mysteries were of Pelasgian origin.</p>
 <p>In Samothrace there were also Corybantic rites of Hecate.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a></p>
 <p>These were performed in the Zerynthian cave, <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">110</font></a> from which Apollo and Artemis derived an epithet. <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">111</font></a> The sacrifice of dogs to Hecate held a prominent place in these mysteries. This sacrificial rite is so infrequent in Greek religion that it commands special attention wherever it is found. The Corybantic rites of Samothrace show that Hecate of this place was closely akin to the goddess of the same name, who was worshipped with Zeus Panamerius at Lagina in Caria, the chief centre of her cult in Asia Minor. <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">112</font></a> Strabo <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">113</font></a> classes her cult as Phrygian-Thracian. Farnell <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">114</font></a> comments on the close connection between Artemis Pheraea of Thessaly and this Hecate and suggests Thrace as the home of the cult. Some supporting evidence for this opinion may be obtained by comparing with the statement that dogs were offered to Hecate in Samothrace a remark of Sextus Empiricus, <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">115</font></a> that the Thracians used this animal for food.</p>
 <p>In Lemnos there were similar Corybantic rites in honour of Bendis, who is thus brought into relationship with Samothracian Cybele and her reflex Hecate, as well as with Cretan Rhea. <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">116</font></a> This "Great Goddess" of Lemnos is Thracian Bendis, the fierce huntress of the two spears and the double worship, "of the heavens and of the earth," who received human sacrifice in her own country. <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">117</font></a> She entered the Greek pantheon as Thracian Artemis, closely allied to Cybele and Hecate. She has a counterpart in Φωσφόρος, from whom the Thracian Bosphorus was named, a goddess in whose rites the torch has a conspicuous place. <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">118</font></a></p>

 <p>Thus a long list may be made out of female deities who show the general characteristics of Phrygian Cybele: the Lydian Mother, Cybebe or Cybele; Rhea of Crete; Hecate of Samothrace and Lagina; Bendis of Thrace and Lemnos; Cappadocian Mâ; <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">119</font></a> Britomartis, or Dictynna, of Crete, who is Aphaea at Aegina; <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">120</font></a> the Syrian goddess of Hierapolis; <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">121</font></a> several forms of Artemis,--of the Tauric Chersonese, of Brauron, of Laodicea <a name="fr_121"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">122</font></a> of Ephesus, <a name="fr_122"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">123</font></a> Artemis-Aphrodite of Persia. <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">124</font></a> The conception common to all these is that of a nature-goddess, whose rites are orgiastic, and whose protection, as that of a woman-warrior, is claimed for the state. It is probably correct to assume that Artemis Tauropolos, to whom Diodorus <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">125</font></a> says that the Amazons offered sacrifice, is a form of Cybele, presumably Tauric Artemis. Therefore this name should be added to the list. It deserves special prominence, because the Amazons are shown to have been her votaries. In connection with Aphrodite, who, like Artemis, although less frequently, was identified with the Mother, Arnobius <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">126</font></a> relates that in a frenzy of devotion to this deity the daughter of a Gallus cut off her breasts, a story strikingly reminiscent of the tradition of single-breasted Amazons, and also suggestive of the fact</p>

 <p>that there were Galli in certain forms of Aphrodite's worship. <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">127</font></a></p>
 <p>The cult of Cybele seems to have been an indigenous religion in Phrygia and Lydia, <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">128</font></a> duplicated in almost all its essential details by that of Cretan Rhea. Since the Cretan rites of the Mother, in all probability, belonged originally to the Eteocretan population of the island, a non-Hellenic folk apparently, who seem to have been akin to the Asiatic folk not far away, <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">129</font></a> Rhea-Cybele may fairly be regarded as the deity of a common stock in Crete, Phrygia, and Lydia. From the circumstance that the double-axe is a religious symbol which occurs frequently wherever there are remains of the pre-Hellenic, or "Minoan," civilisation of Crete and of that thence derived, the "Mycenaean," and from the fact that in historic times this appears as the regular symbol of various forms of the Asiatic Mother, <a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_129"><font size="1">130</font></a> there is ground for the inference that the stock with whom the worship of Rhea-Cybele was deeply rooted was that which predominated in Crete and the other lands where the same brilliant culture flourished before the rise of the Hellenic states. It is to be noted that the battle-axe of the Amazons is this very weapon, but the point may not be pressed in this context. Herodotus, <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">131</font></a> it has been seen, asserted out of his knowledge as an initiate, that the mysteries of Samothrace were of Pelasgic origin. He undoubtedly conceived of the Pelasgians as a non-Hellenic race who preceded the Hellenes in the occupation of Greece, and therefore we must interpret his remarks about the <i>Cabiria</i> as meaning that these rites were</p>

 <p>instituted by a pre-Hellenic people. <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">132</font></a> It is tempting to identify this people with the pre-Ionic inhabitants of Samos, who, according to Pausanias, <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">133</font></a> settled Samothrace. Thus the worshippers of Cybele in Samothrace would be shown to be akin to the stock who honoured her in Crete, <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">134</font></a> Lydia, and Phrygia.</p>
 <p>This Mother, whose worship was widely spread under her own name and many others, was revered by the Amazons in the primitive baetylic form of the rites of Pessinus; as Mother of the Gods in Samothrace, where she was identified both with Cabiric Demeter and with Hecate; as Artemis Tauropolos, or the Tauric Virgin, who was probably a goddess of the Thracians. <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">135</font></a></p>

Miss Harrison's study is under these headings: "1. The Kouretes as Δαίμονες and Πρόπολοι; 2. The Kouretes as Magicians, as Μάντεις and Metallurgists; 3. The Kouretes as armed Ὀρχηστῆρες; 4. The Kouretes as Φύλακες andΠαιδοτρόφοι; 5. Zagreus and the Thunder-Rites; 6. The Kouros as Year-God; 7. The Kouretes as Ὀργιοφάνται."
