 <h4 align="CENTER">BETA, OR ADONAI, THE MANIFESTOR <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_204"><font size="1">2</font></a></h4>
 <p>THEN from the midst of the Divine Duality, the Only Begotten of God came forth:</p>
 <p>2. Adonai, the Word, the Voice invisible.</p>
 <p>3. He was in the beginning, and by Him were all things discovered.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>
 <p>4. Without Him was not anything made which is visible.</p>
 <p>5. For He is the Manifestor, and in Him was the life of the world.</p>
 <p>6. God the nameless hath not revealed God, but Adonai hath revealed God from the beginning.</p>
 <p>7. He is the presentation of Elohim, and by Him the Gods are made manifest.</p>
 <p>8. He is the third aspect of the Divine Triad:</p>
 <p>9. Co-equal with the Spirit and the heavenly deep.</p>
 <p>10. For except by three in one, the Spirits of the Invisible Light could not have been made manifest.</p>
 <p>11. But now is the prism perfect, and the generation of the Gods discovered in their order.</p>
 <p>12. Adonai dissolves and resumes; in His two hands are the dual powers of all things.</p>
 <p>13. He is of His Father the Spirit, and of His Mother the great deep.</p>
 <p>14. Having the potency of both in Himself, and the power of things material.</p>
 <p>15. Yet being Himself invisible, for He is the cause, and not the effect.</p>
 <p>16. He is the Manifestor, and not that which is manifest.</p>
 <p>17. That which is manifest is the Divine Substance. <a name="fr_205"></a><a href="cws65.htm#fn_205"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
