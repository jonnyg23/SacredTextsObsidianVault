 <h4 align="CENTER">CONCERNING THE ÆON OF THE CHRIST <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">1</font></a></h4>
 <p>THE Christs are above all things <i>media</i>, and the various descriptions they gave of their office--such as "I am the way, the truth, and the life." "I am the door," and the like--referred not to themselves at all, but to the Spirit who spoke through them. Jesus, when questioned on this very subject, said plainly, "The words which I speak unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father which dwelleth in me, he doeth the works." Jesus, then, spoke as he was moved by the Holy Ghost, and was no other than a clear glass through which the divine glory shone. [As it is written, "And we beheld his glory, the glory <i>as of</i> the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." Now, the Only Begotten is not mortal man, but he who has been in the bosom of the Father from all eternity, even the Word, the Maker, the Speaker, the Manifestor.] It was this Holy Spirit which descended upon Jesus at his baptism, and dwelt in him for the time of his sojourn upon earth, speaking through him and controlling him; while he, on his part, so lived as to bring all his personal will into oneness with that Spirit.</p>
 <p>The Spirit answers to the Essence, the Father, and the Word. Of these, the first is one of the seven spirits, or divine flames, of universal Divinity. The second is the angel, or God, of the planet, and is the Æon of the Christ. The third is the Christ. They are respectively "the spirit, the water, <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the blood." The Father and the Word may therefore be said to be one;</p>

 <p>for by the Word the Father is manifest, and--in the microcosm--the Word is the Father manifested.</p>
 <p>The greatest hierarch--he, that is, who has the most perfect control over Nature--is not only a man of many incarnations, but has obtained from God the greatest and rarest of gifts,--that of being a medium for the Highest. <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">1</font></a> Such a one is the Æon, <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">2</font></a> and has what is called the "double portion." Elisha craved and received this grace. "Where now is the God of Elijah?" he cried, when endeavouring to work his first miracle; and he besought Elijah that a portion of his double <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">3</font></a> might rest upon him. For Elijah had so transmuted his soul into spirit that it was doubled, and a portion of this he bestowed on Elisha. Such an Æon it was that descended upon Jesus, to quit him at the final moment. Hence the exclamation, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>
