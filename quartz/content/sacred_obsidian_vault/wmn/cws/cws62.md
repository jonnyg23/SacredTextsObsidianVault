 <h4 align="CENTER">CONCERNING ORIGINAL BEING; OR, "BEFORE THE BEGINNING" <a name="fr_202"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">1</font></a></h4>
 <p>BEFORE the beginning of things, before the generation of the heavens, the great and invisible God alone subsisted.</p>
 <p>2. Even the God whose name is unspeakable, upon Whom no eye hath ever looked, whose nature no mind create can fathom.</p>
 <p>3. In the bosom of the eternal were all the Gods comprehended, as the seven spirits of the prism, contained in the Invisible Light.</p>
 <p>4. The Elohim filled and comprised the universe, and the universe was at rest.</p>
 <p>5. There was no motion, nor darkness, nor space, nor matter.</p>
 <p>6. There was no other than God.</p>
 <p>7. For there was One only, the Uncreate and Self-subsistent.</p>
 <p>8. But forasmuch as motion was conceived in the bosom of the Elohim, the Invisible Light moved on itself;</p>
 <p>9. And gathering itself inward toward its axis, left beyond and without it another self.</p>
 <p>10. So that where God was not, there was darkness and the abyss.</p>
 <p>11. Yet had the darkness of itself no existence, for before the beginning God was all in all.</p>
 <p>12. And that which had been God became darkness by the withdrawal of God.</p>
 <p>13. So that the darkness is no entity, for it is the negation of being.</p>
 <p>14. It is no presence, for where a presence is, there is God.</p>
 <p>15. Neither can it produce, neither can it be manifested, neither can it be annihilated.</p>
 <p>16. Yet, forasmuch as the darkness doth not comprehend God, it is as another self.</p>
 <p>17. Not having power in itself, for all power is God's.</p>
 <p>18. Neither having personality, for all personality is of God.</p>
 <p>19. But unless there were again to be cessation of motion, there can be no extinction of negation.</p>
 <p>20. It may be bounded, but never annihilated.</p>
 <p>21. Whatever is, is of God; but God only is absolute and perfect being.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a></p>
 <p>22. All things visible and invisible were potential in God before the beginning, and of God's fulness we have all received.</p>
 <p>23. Inasmuch as anything is absolute, strong, perfect, true, insomuch it resembles God and is God.</p>
 <p>24. Inasmuch as anything is out of reason, weak, divided, false, insomuch it approaches negation, and is of negation.</p>
 <p>25. Now the Absolute, which is God, is Spirit.</p>
