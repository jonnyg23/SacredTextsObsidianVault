 <h4 align="CENTER">CONCERNING SIN AND DEATH <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_195"><font size="1">2</font></a></h4>
 <p>AS is the outer so is the inner: He that worketh is One.</p>
 <p>2. As the small is, so is the great: there is one law.</p>
 <p>3. Nothing is small and nothing is great in the Divine Economy.</p>
 <p>4. If thou wouldst understand the method of the world's</p>
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>
 <p>corruption, and the condition to which sin hath reduced the work of God,</p>
 <p>5. Meditate upon the aspect of a corpse; and consider the method of the putrefaction of its tissues and humours.</p>
 <p>6. For the secret of death is the same, whether of the outer or of the inner.</p>
 <p>7. The body dieth when the central will of its system no longer bindeth in obedience the elements of its substance.</p>
 <p>8. Every cell is a living entity, whether of vegetable or of animal potency.</p>
 <p>9. In the healthy body every cell is polarised in subjection to the central will, the Adonai of the physical system.</p>
 <p>10. Health, therefore, is order, obedience, and government.</p>
 <p>11. But wherever disease is, there is disunion, rebellion, and insubordination.</p>
 <p>12. And the deeper the seat of the confusion the more dangerous the malady, and the harder to quell it.</p>
 <p>13. That which is superficial may be more easily healed; or, if need be, the disorderly elements may be rooted out, and the body shall be whole and at unity again.</p>
 <p>14. But if the disobedient molecules corrupt each other continually, and the perversity spread, and the rebellious tracts multiply their elements; the whole body shall fall into dissolution, which is death.</p>
 <p>15. For the central will, that should dominate all the kingdom of the body, is no longer obeyed; and every element is become its own ruler, and hath a divergent will of its own.</p>
 <p>1:6. So that the poles of the cells incline in divers directions; and the binding power, which is the life of the body, is dissolved and destroyed.</p>
 <p>17. And when dissolution is complete, then follow corruption and putrefaction.</p>
 <p>18. Now, that which is true of the physical, is true likewise of its prototype.</p>
 <p>19. The whole world is full of revolt; and every element hath a will divergent from God.</p>
 <p>20. Whereas there ought to be but one will, attracting and ruling the whole man.</p>
 <p>21. But there is no longer brotherhood among you; nor order, nor mutual sustenance.</p>
 <p>22. Every cell is its own arbiter; and every member is become a sect.</p>
 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>
 <p>23. Ye are not bound one to another: ye have confounded your offices and abandoned your functions.</p>
 <p>24. Ye have reversed the direction of your magnetic currents; ye are fallen into confusion, and have given place to the spirit of misrule.</p>
 <p>25. Your wills are many and diverse; and every one of you is an anarchy.</p>
 <p>26. A house that is divided against itself, falleth.</p>
 <p>27. O wretched man; who shall deliver you from this body of death?</p>
