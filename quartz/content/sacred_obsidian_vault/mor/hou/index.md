 One of the problems with literature about and by Mormons, is that,
 <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i>, there are very few texts
 without an extreme point of view.
 This is one of the few comprehensive histories of 19th century Mormonism
 which was written with a center of gravity close
 to what we moderns call a 'neutral point of view.'
 Written by (or under the aegis of) H.H. Bancroft, the foremost
 historian of the Western US, this massive book tells the story
 of the settlement of what would become the state of Utah.
 This is, naturally, closely bound up with the saga of the Mormon
 persecution and exodus.
 </p><p>
 </p>
 This book draws on a huge library of contemporary sources, which
 Bancroft assembled with the help of an army of assistants.
 Every statement of fact, every incident mentioned, is backed up
 in the extensive footnotes, some stretching across five or six pages.
 Bancroft is not afraid to deal with touchy subjects such as the
 Mountain Meadows massacre, polygamy, and the quirks of the Mormon leaders.
 Despite the neutral stance, Bancroft is not unsympathetic to the Mormons.
 He praises them as industrious, sober, and law-abiding people
 (and to document that, he carefully adds a huge footnote with
 a compiled table of crime statistics, broken down by Mormon/non-Mormon!).
 
 <p>
 There are also many points of general interest here,
 such as how Utah happened to be the first US territory to let women vote,
 the story of the Deseret alphabet, and how some seagulls saved the pioneers
 from starving.
 His review of the polygamy issue is extremely relevant to
 the debate over acceptable forms of marriage today.
 This book is required reading if you want to understand the background
 of the Mormons.
 Both Mormon and 'Gentile' will find a lot to like in this volume.
