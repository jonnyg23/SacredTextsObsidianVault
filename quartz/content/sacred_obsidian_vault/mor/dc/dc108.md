 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_108:2">108:2</a></font></span> Therefore, let your soul be at rest concerning your spiritual standing, and resist no more my voice.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_108:3">108:3</a></font></span> And arise up and be more careful henceforth in observing your vows, which you have made and do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great blessings.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_108:4">108:4</a></font></span> Wait patiently until the solemn assembly shall be called of my servants, then you shall be remembered with the first of mine elders, and receive right by ordination with the rest of mine elders whom I have chosen.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_108:5">108:5</a></font></span> Behold, this is the promise of the Father unto you if you continue faithful.</p>
