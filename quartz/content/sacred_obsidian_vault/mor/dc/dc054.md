 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:1">54:1</a></font></span> Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was crucified for the sins of the world—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:2">54:2</a></font></span> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:3">54:3</a></font></span> And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:4">54:4</a></font></span> And as the covenant which they made unto me has been broken, even so it has become void and of none effect.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:5">54:5</a></font></span> And wo to him by whom this offense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:6">54:6</a></font></span> But blessed are they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:7">54:7</a></font></span> Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:8">54:8</a></font></span> And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:9">54:9</a></font></span> And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_54:10">54:10</a></font></span> And again, be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early shall find rest to their souls. Even so. Amen. </p>
