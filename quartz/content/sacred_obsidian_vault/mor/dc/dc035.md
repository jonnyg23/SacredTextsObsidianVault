Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, at or near Fayette, New York, December 1830. <i><br> History of the Church</i> 1:128-31.</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a></font></span> Listen to the voice of the Lord your God, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, whose course is one eternal round, the same today as yesterday, and forever.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a></font></span> I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, even as many as will believe on my name, that they may become the sons of God, even one in me as I am one in the Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a></font></span> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my servant Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works. I have heard thy prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a></font></span> Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things. Behold thou wast sent forth, even as John, to prepare the way before me, and before Elijah which should come, and thou knewest it not.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a></font></span> Thou didst baptize by water unto repentance, but they received not the Holy Ghost;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a></font></span> But now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a></font></span> And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land, even among the Gentiles, for their folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a></font></span> For I am God, and mine arm is not shortened; and I will show miracles, signs, and wonders, unto all those who believe on my name.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a></font></span> And whoso shall ask it in my name in faith, they shall cast out devils; they shall heal the sick; they shall cause the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a></font></span> And the time speedily cometh that great things are to be shown forth unto the children of men;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a></font></span> But without faith shall not anything be shown forth except desolations upon Babylon, the same which has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a></font></span> And there are none that doeth good except those who are ready to receive the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth unto this generation.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a></font></span> Wherefore, I call upon the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a></font></span> And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their shield and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their enemies shall be under their feet; and I will let fall the sword in their behalf, and by the fire of mine indignation will I preserve them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a></font></span> And the poor and the meek shall have the gospel preached unto them, and they shall be looking forth for the time of my coming, for it is nigh at hand—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a></font></span> And they shall learn the parable of the fig-tree, for even now already summer is nigh.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a></font></span> And I have sent forth the fulness of my gospel by the hand of my servant Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a></font></span> And I have given unto him the keys of the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which were from the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming, if he abide in me, and if not, another will I plant in his stead.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a></font></span> Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail not, and it shall be given by the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, that knoweth all things.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:20">35:20</a></font></span> And a commandment I give unto thee—that thou shalt write for him; and the scriptures shall be given, even as they are in mine own bosom, to the salvation of mine own elect;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a></font></span> For they will hear my voice, and shall see me, and shall not be asleep, and shall abide the day of my coming; for they shall be purified, even as I am pure.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:22">35:22</a></font></span> And now I say unto you, tarry with him, and he shall journey with you; forsake him not, and surely these things shall be fulfilled.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:23">35:23</a></font></span> And inasmuch as ye do not write, behold, it shall be given unto him to prophesy; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on the holy prophets to prove his words, as they shall be given him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:24">35:24</a></font></span> Keep all the commandments and covenants by which ye are bound; and I will cause the heavens to shake for your good, and Satan shall tremble and Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:25">35:25</a></font></span> And Israel shall be saved in mine own due time; and by the keys which I have given shall they be led, and no more be confounded at all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a></font></span> Lift up your hearts and be glad, your redemption draweth nigh.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_35:27">35:27</a></font></span> Fear not, little flock, the kingdom is yours until I come. Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen. </p>
