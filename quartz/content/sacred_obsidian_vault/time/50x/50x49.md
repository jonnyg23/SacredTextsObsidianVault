 <p>RING out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br> The flying cloud, the frosty light:<br> The year is dying in the night;<br> Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.</p>  
 <p>Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br> Ring, happy bells, across the snow:<br> The year is going, let him go;<br> Ring out the false, ring in the true.</p>  
 <p>Ring out the grief that saps the mind,<br> For those that here we see no more;<br> Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br> Ring in redress to all mankind.</p>  
 <p>Ring out the want, the care, the sin,<br> The faithless coldness of the times;<br> Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,<br> But ring in the fuller minstrel in.</p>  
 <p>Ring out old shapes of foul disease;<br> Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br> Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br> Ring in the thousand years of peace.</p>  
 <p>Ring in the valiant man and free,<br> The larger heart, the kindlier hand<br> Ring out the darkness of the land,<br> Ring in the Christ that is to be.</p>  
 <p>--ALFRED TENNYSON</p>
