 <p>BEHOLD a silly tender Babe,<br> In freezing winter night,<br> In homely manger trembling lies<br> Alas! a piteous sight.</p>  
 <p>The inns are full, no man will yield<br> This little Pilgrim bed;<br> But forced He is with silly beasts<br> In crib to shroud His head.</p>  
 <p>Despise Him not for lying there,<br> First what He is inquire;<br> An orient pearl is often found<br> In depth of dirty mire.</p>  
 <p>Weigh not His crib, His wooden dish,<br> Nor beasts that by Him feed;<br> Weigh not His mother's poor attire,<br> Nor Joseph's simple weed.</p>  
 <p>This stable is a prince's court,<br> This crib His chair of state;<br> The beasts are parcel of His pomp,<br> The wooden dish His plate.</p>  
 <p>With joy approach, O Christian Wight!<br> Do homage to thy King;<br> And highly praise this humble pomp<br> Which He from heaven doth bring.</p>  
 <p>--ROBERT SOUTHWELL</p>
