 <p>LITTLE lamb, who made thee?<br> Dost thou know who made thee,<br> Gave thee life, and bade thee feed<br> By the stream and o'er the mead;<br> Gave thee clothing of delight,<br> Softest clothing, woolly, bright;<br> Gave thee such a tender voice,<br> Making all the vales rejoice?<br> Little lamb, who made thee?<br> Dost thou know who made thee?</p>  
 <p>Little lamb, I'll tell thee;<br> Little lamb, I'll tell thee;<br> He is called by thy name,<br> For He calls Himself a lamb;<br> He is meek and He is mild,<br> He became a little child.<br> I a child and thou a lamb,<br> We are called by His name.<br> Little lamb, God bless thee!<br> Little lamb, God bless thee!</p>
