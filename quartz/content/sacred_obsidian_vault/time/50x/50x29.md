 <p>DIM-BERRIED is the mistletoe<br> With globes of sheenless grey,<br> The holly mid ten thousand thorns<br> Smolders its fires away;<br> And in the manger Jesu sleeps<br> This Christmas Day.<br> Bull unto bull with hollow throat<br> Makes echo every hill,<br> Cold sheep in pastures thick with snow<br> The air with bleatings fill;<br> While of His Mother's heart this Babe<br> Takes His sweet will.<br> All flowers and butterflies lie hid,<br> The blackbird and the thrush<br> Pipe but a little as they flit<br> Restless from bush to bush;<br> Even to the robin Gabriel hath<br> Cried softly, "Hush!"<br> Now night is astir with burning stars<br> In darkness of the snow;<br> Burdened with frankincense and myrrh<br> And gold the Strangers go<br> Into a dusk where one dim lamp<br> Burns faintly, Lo!<br> No snowdrop yet its small head nods,<br> In winds of winter drear;<br> No lark at casement in the sky<br> Sings matins shrill and clear;<br> Yet in this frozen mirk the Dawn<br> Breathes, Spring is here! </p>
