 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Fifty Christmas Poems for Children</i>, by Florence B. Hyett, [1923], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h3 align="center">BETHLEHEM</h3>  
 <p>WHERE man was all too marred with sin,<br> The ass, the ox were bidden in.</p>  
 <p>Where angels were unmeet to come<br> These humble entered Holydom.</p>  
 <p>"Their innocent eyes and full of awe<br> Saw the fulfilment of the law.</p>  
 <p>There in the stable with the beast<br> The Christmas Child hath spread His feast.</p>  
 <p>These gave their bed and eke their board<br> To be a cradle for their Lord.</p>  
 <p>Their honey-breath, their tears all mild,<br> Warmed in the cold the new-born Child.</p>  
 <p>These His adorers were before<br> The Kings and Shepherds thronged the door.</p>  
 <p>And where no angels knelt there kneeled<br> The innocent creatures of the field.</p>  
 <p>O simple ones, much honoured;<br> He who oppresses you indeed</p>  
 <p>Oppresses His kind hosts that lay<br> Once in the stable on the bay.</p>  
 <p>--KATHARINE TYNAN</p>
