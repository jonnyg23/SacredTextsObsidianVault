 <p>THE Blessed Mary had a lamb,<br> It too was white as snow,<br> Far whiter than I ever am--<br> Always and always so.</p>  
 <p>She found it lying in the stall<br> Wherefrom the oxen fed,<br> With hay for bedding, hay for shawl,<br> And hay beneath its head.</p>  
 <p>She followed near it every day<br> In all the paths it trod,<br> She knew her lamb could never stray<br> (It was the Lamb of God).</p>  
 <p>And when the cloud of angels came<br> And hid It from her sight,<br> Its heart was near her all the same<br> Because her own was white.</p>  
 <p>So when she slept white lilies screened<br> Her sleep from all alarms,<br> Till from His Throne her white lamb leaned<br> And waked her in His Arms.</p>
