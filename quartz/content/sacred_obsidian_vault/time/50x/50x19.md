 <p>WHO is crying in the night<br> At my nursery door?<br> What's that pretty shining light<br> On the nursery floor?"</p>  
 <p>Mary in her little bed<br> Rises up to see.<br> "Jesus, is it you?" she said:<br> "Come and talk to me."</p>  
 <p>Nothing stirred: then out she creeps,<br> Down the winding stair.<br> All is dark; the household sleeps.<br> Jesus isn't there.</p>  
 <p>Out into the winter night,<br> Barefoot she must go,<br> In her cotton night-gown white,<br> Through the glistening snow.</p>  
 <p>Through the garden fast she goes,<br> Through the stable yard:<br> Yes, the manger's here, she knows.<br> Oh! the door is barred!</p>  
 <p>Then there came an Angel bright,<br> Drew away the pin;<br> All the place was full of light,<br> As she flitted in.</p>  
 <p>There, within the stall, He lay!<br> And the Ox and Ass<br> Gently moved a little way<br> Just to let her pass.</p>  
 <p>And on little Mary, sweet<br> Mother Mary smiled,<br> As she kissed the hands and feet<br> Of the Holy Child.</p>  
 <p>Ah! He fades! He is not here!<br> Whither has He flown?<br> Wake, Miss Mary, wake my dear!<br> Mary's all alone.</p>  
 <p>Nurse is standing by the bed,<br> In the morning grey:<br> "You've been dreaming, dear," she said.<br> "And it's Christmas Day."</p>
