 <p>THAT sweeter music can we bring<br> Than a carol, for to sing<br> The birth of this our heavenly King?<br> Awake the voice; awake the string!<br> Heart, ear, and eye, and everything!</p>  
 <p>Why does the chilling winter's morn<br> Smile, like a field beset with corn?<br> Or smell, like to a mead new-shorn,<br> Thus, on the sudden?</p>  
 <p>Come and see<br> The cause, why things thus fragrant be.<br> 'Tis He is born, whose quickening birth<br> Gives light and lustre, public mirth,<br> To heaven, and the under-earth.</p>  
 <p>The darling of the world is come,<br> And fit it is we find a room<br> To welcome Him. The nobler part<br> Of all the house here, is the heart,<br> Which we will give Him; and bequeath<br> This holly, and this ivy wreath,<br> To do Him honour; who's our King,<br> And Lord of all this revelling.</p>
