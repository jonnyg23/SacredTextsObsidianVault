 <p>In the mind of the average sensual Englishman perhaps the most vivid images 
 called up by the word Christmas are those connected with eating and drinking. 
 “Ha più da fare che i forni di Natale in Inghilterra,”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_108">108</a><a name="FNanchor_108"></a> an Italian proverb used of a very busy person, 
 sufficiently suggests the character of our Christmas.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_109">109</a><a name="FNanchor_109"></a> It may be that the Christmas dinner looms larger 
 among the English than among most other peoples, but in every country a 
 distinctive meal of some kind is associated with the season. We have already 
 seen how this illustrates the immemorial connection between material feasting 
 and religious rejoicing.</p>
 <p>Let us note some forms of “Christmas fare” and try to get an idea of their 
 origin. First we may look at English feasting customs, though, as they have been 
 pretty fully described by <a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 284</font></a> <a name="Page_284"></a>previous writers, no very elaborate account of them need be 
 given.</p>
 <p>The gross eating and drinking in former days at Christmas, of which our 
 present mild gluttony is but a pale reflection, would seem to be connected with 
 the old November feast, though transferred to the season hallowed by Christ's 
 birth. The show of slaughtered beasts, adorned with green garlands, in an 
 English town just before Christmas, reminds one strongly of the old November 
 killing. In displays of this kind the pig's head is specially conspicuous, and 
 points to the time when the swine was a favourite sacrificial animal.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-1">13-1</a><a name="Nanchor_13-1"></a> We may recall here the traditional carol sung at 
 Queen's College, Oxford, as the boar's head is solemnly brought in at Christmas, 
 and found elsewhere in other forms:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“The boar's head in hand bear 
 I,</span><br><span class="i2">Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary;</span><br><span class="i2">And I pray you, my masters, be merry,</span><br><span class="i3"><i>Quot 
 estis in convivio.</i></span><br><span class="i3"><i>Caput apri 
 defero,</i></span><br><span class="i3"><i>Reddens laudes Domino.</i> ”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-2">13-2</a><a name="Nanchor_13-2"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>The Christmas bird provided by the familiar “goose club” may be compared with 
 the German Martinmas goose. The more luxurious turkey must be relatively an 
 innovation, for that bird seems not to have been introduced into England until 
 the sixteenth century.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-3">13-3</a><a name="Nanchor_13-3"></a> </p>
 <p>Cakes and pies, partly or wholly of vegetable origin, are, of course, as 
 conspicuous at the English Christmas as animal food. The peculiar “luckiness” 
 attached to some of them (as when mince-pies, eaten in different houses during 
 the Twelve Days, bring a happy month each) makes one suspect some more serious 
 original purpose than mere gratification of the appetite. A sacrificial or 
 sacramental origin is probable, at least in certain cases; a cake made of flour, 
 for instance, may well have been regarded as embodying the spirit immanent in 
 the corn.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-4">13-4</a><a name="Nanchor_13-4"></a> Whether any mystic significance ever belonged to the 
 plum-pudding it is hard to say, though the sprig of holly stuck into its <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a> <a name="Page_285"></a>top recalls the lucky green boughs we have so often come 
 across, and a resemblance to the libations upon the Christmas log might be seen 
 in the burning brandy.</p>
 <p>A dish once prominent at Christmas was “frumenty” or “furmety” (variously 
 spelt, and derived from the Latin <i>frumentum</i>, corn). It was made of hulled 
 wheat boiled in milk and seasoned with cinnamon, sugar, &amp;c.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-5">13-5</a><a name="Nanchor_13-5"></a> This too may have been a cereal sacrament. In 
 Yorkshire it was the first thing eaten on Christmas morning, just as ale posset 
 was the last thing drunk on Christmas Eve. Ale posset was a mixture of beer and 
 milk, and each member of the family in turn had to take a “sup,” as also a piece 
 of a large apple-pie.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-6">13-6</a><a name="Nanchor_13-6"></a> </p>
 <p>In the Highlands of Scotland, among those who observed Christmas, a 
 characteristic dish was new sowens (the husks and siftings of oatmeal), given to 
 the family early on Christmas Day in their beds. They were boiled into the 
 consistence of molasses and were poured into as many bickers as there were 
 people to partake of them. Everyone on despatching his bicker jumped out of 
 bed.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-7">13-7</a><a name="Nanchor_13-7"></a> Here, as in the case of the Yorkshire frumenty, the 
 eating has a distinctly ceremonial character.</p>
 <p>In the East Riding of Yorkshire a special Yule cake was eaten on Christmas 
 Eve, “made of flour, barm, large cooking raisins, currants, lemon-peel, and 
 nutmeg,” and about as large as a dinner-plate.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-8">13-8</a><a name="Nanchor_13-8"></a> In Shropshire “wigs” or caraway buns dipped in ale 
 were eaten on Christmas Eve.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-9">13-9</a><a name="Nanchor_13-9"></a> Again elsewhere there were Yule Doughs or Dows, little 
 images of paste, presented by bakers to their customers.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-10">13-10</a><a name="Nanchor_13-10"></a> We shall see plenty of parallels to these on the 
 Continent. When they are in animal or even human form they may in some cases 
 have taken the place of actual sacrificial victims.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-11">13-11</a><a name="Nanchor_13-11"></a> </p>
 <p>In Nottinghamshire the Christmas cake was associated with the wassail-bowl in 
 a manner which may be compared with the Macedonian custom described later; it 
 was broken up and put into the bowl, hot ale was poured over it, and so it was 
 eaten.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-12">13-12</a><a name="Nanchor_13-12"></a> </p>
 <p>The wassail-bowl﻿—one cannot leave the subject of English Yuletide feasting 
 without a few words upon this beloved beaker of hot spiced ale and toasted 
 apples (“lambswool”). <i>Wassail</i> is <a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a> <a name="Page_286"></a>derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>wes hál</i> = be whole, and 
 wassailing is in its essence the wishing of a person's very good health. The 
 origin of drinking healths is not obvious; perhaps it may be sacramental: the 
 draught may have been at first a means of communion with some divinity, and then 
 its consumption may have come to be regarded not only as benefiting the 
 partaker, but as a rite that could be performed for the welfare of another 
 person. Apart from such speculations, we may note the frequent mention of 
 wassailing in old English carols of the less ecclesiastical type; the singers 
 carried with them a bowl or cup which they expected their wealthier neighbours 
 to fill with drink.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-13">13-13</a><a name="Nanchor_13-13"></a> Sometimes the bowl was adorned with ribbons and had 
 a golden apple at the top,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-14">13-14</a><a name="Nanchor_13-14"></a> and it is a noteworthy fact that the box with the 
 Christmas images, mentioned in Chapter IV. (p.  <a href="crt07.htm#Page_118">118</a>), 
 is sometimes called “the Vessel [Wassail] Cup.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-15">13-15</a><a name="Nanchor_13-15"></a> </p>
 <p>The various Christmas dishes of Europe would form an interesting subject for 
 exhaustive study. To suggest a religious origin for each would be going too far, 
 for merely economic considerations must have had much to do with the matter, but 
 it is very probable that in some cases they are relics of sacrifices or 
 sacraments.</p>
 <p>The pig is a favourite food animal at Christmas in other countries than our 
 own, a fact probably connected with sacrificial customs. In Denmark and Sweden a 
 pig's head was one of the principal articles of the great Christmas Eve 
 repast.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-16">13-16</a><a name="Nanchor_13-16"></a> In Germany it is a fairly widespread custom to kill 
 a pig shortly before Christmas and partake of it on Christmas Day; its entrails 
 and bones and the straw which has been in contact with it are supposed to have 
 fertilizing powers.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-17">13-17</a><a name="Nanchor_13-17"></a> In Roumania a pig is the Christmas animal <i>par 
 excellence</i>,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-18">13-18</a><a name="Nanchor_13-18"></a> in Russia pigs trotters are a favourite dish at the 
 New Year,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-19">13-19</a><a name="Nanchor_13-19"></a> and in every Servian house roast pig is the 
 principal Christmas dish.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-20">13-20</a><a name="Nanchor_13-20"></a> </p>
 <p>In Upper Bavaria there is a custom which almost certainly has at its root a 
 sacrifice: a number of poor people club together at Christmas-time and buy a cow 
 to be killed and eaten at a common feast.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-21">13-21</a><a name="Nanchor_13-21"></a> </p>
 <p>More doubtful is the sacrificial origin of the dishes of certain <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 287</font></a> <a name="Page_287"></a>special kinds of fish on Christmas Eve. In Saxony and 
 Thuringia herring salad is eaten﻿—he who bakes it will have money all the 
 year﻿—and in many parts of Germany and also in Styria carp is then consumed.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-22">13-22</a><a name="Nanchor_13-22"></a> Round Ercé in Brittany the family dish is cod.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-23">13-23</a><a name="Nanchor_13-23"></a> In Italy the <i>cenone</i> or great supper held on 
 Christmas Eve has fish for its animal basis, and stewed eels are particularly 
 popular. It is to be remembered that in Catholic countries the Vigil of the 
 Nativity is a fast, and meat is not allowed upon it; this alone would account 
 for the prominence of fish on Christmas Eve.</p>
 <p>We have already come across peculiar cakes eaten at various pre-Christmas 
 festivals; at Christmas itself special kinds of bread, pastry, and cakes abound 
 on the Continent, and in some cases at least may have a religious origin.</p>
 <p>In France various sorts of cakes and loaves are known at the season of 
 <i>Noël</i>. In Berry on Christmas morning loaves called <i>cornabœux</i>, made 
 in the shape of horns or a crescent, are distributed to the poor. In Lorraine 
 people give one another <i>cognés</i> or <i>cogneux</i>, a kind of pastry in the 
 shape of two crescents back to back, or else long and narrow in form and with a 
 crescent at either end. In some parts of France the <i>cornabœux</i> are known 
 as <i>hôlais</i>, and ploughmen give to the poor as many of these loaves as they 
 possess oxen and horses.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-24">13-24</a><a name="Nanchor_13-24"></a> These horns may be substitutes for a sacrifice of 
 oxen.</p>
 <p>Sometimes the French Christmas cakes have the form of complete oxen or 
 horses﻿—such were the thin unleavened cakes sold in the early nineteenth century 
 at La Châtre (Indre). In the neighbourhood of Chartres there are 
 <i>cochenilles</i> and <i>coquelins</i> in animal and human shapes. Little cakes 
 called <i>naulets</i> are sold by French bakers, and actually represent the Holy 
 Child. With them may be compared the <i>coignoles</i> of French Flanders, cakes 
 of oblong form adorned with the figure of the infant Jesus in sugar.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-25">13-25</a><a name="Nanchor_13-25"></a> Sometimes the Christmas loaf or cake in France has 
 healing properties; a certain kind of cake in Berry and Limousin is kept all 
 through the year, and a piece eaten in sickness has marvellous powers.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-26">13-26</a><a name="Nanchor_13-26"></a> </p>
 <p>Cortet gives an extraordinary account of a French custom <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 288</font></a> <a name="Page_288"></a>connected with eating and drinking. At Mouthe (Doubs) there 
 used to be brought to the church at Christmas pies, cakes, and other eatables, 
 and wine of the best. They were called the “De fructu,” and when at Vespers the 
 verse “De fructu ventris tui ponam super sedem tuam” was reached, all the 
 congregation made a rush for these refreshments, contended for them, and carried 
 them off with singing and shouting.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-27">13-27</a><a name="Nanchor_13-27"></a> </p>
 <p>The most remarkable of Christmas cakes or loaves is the Swedish and Danish 
 “Yule Boar,” a loaf in the form of a boar-pig, which stands on the table 
 throughout the festal season. It is often made from the corn of the last sheaf 
 of the harvest, and in it Dr. Frazer finds a clear expression of the idea of the 
 corn-spirit as embodied in pig form. “Often it is kept till sowing-time in 
 spring, when part of it is mixed with the seed corn and part given to the 
 ploughman and plough-horses or plough-oxen to eat, in the expectation of a good 
 harvest.” In some parts of the Esthonian island of Oesel the cake has not the 
 form of a boar, but bears the same name, and on New Year's Day is given to the 
 cattle. In other parts of the island the “Yule Boar” is actually a little pig, 
 roasted on Christmas Eve and set up on the table.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-28">13-28</a><a name="Nanchor_13-28"></a> </p>
 <p>In Germany, besides <i>stollen</i>﻿—a sort of plum-loaf﻿—biscuits, often of 
 animal or human shape, are very conspicuous on Christmas Eve. Any one who has 
 witnessed a German Christmas will remember the extraordinary variety of them, 
 <i>lebkuchen</i>, <i>pfeffernüsse</i>, <i>printen</i>, <i>spekulatius</i> 
 biscuits, &amp;c. In Berlin a great pile of biscuits heaped up on your plate is 
 an important part of the Christmas Eve supper. These of course are nowadays mere 
 luxuries, but they may well have had some sort of sacrificial origin. An 
 admirable and exhaustive study of Teutonic Christmas cakes and biscuits has been 
 made, with infinite pains, by an Austrian professor, Dr. Höfler, who reproduces 
 some curious old biscuits, stamped with highly artistic patterns, preserved in 
 museums.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-29">13-29</a><a name="Nanchor_13-29"></a> </p>
 <p>Among unsophisticated German peasants there is a belief in magical powers 
 possessed by bread baked at Christmas, particularly when moistened by Christmas 
 dew. (This dew is held to be peculiarly sacred, perhaps on account of the words 
 “Rorate, coeli, <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 289</font></a> <a name="Page_289"></a>desuper” used at the Advent Masses.) In Franconia such 
 bread, thrown into a dangerous fire, stills the flames; in the north of Germany, 
 if put during the Twelve Days into the fodder of the cattle, it makes them 
 prolific and healthy throughout the year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-30">13-30</a><a name="Nanchor_13-30"></a> </p>
 <p>It is pleasant to note that animals are often specially cared for at 
 Christmas. Up till the early nineteenth century the cattle in Shropshire were 
 always better fed at Christmas than at other times, and Miss Burne tells of an 
 old gentleman in Cheshire who used then to give his poultry a double portion of 
 grain, for, he said, “all creation should rejoice at Christmas, and the dumb 
 creatures had no other manner of doing so.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-31">13-31</a><a name="Nanchor_13-31"></a> The saying reminds one of that lover of Christmas 
 and the animals, St. Francis of Assisi. It will be remembered how he wished that 
 oxen and asses should have extra corn and hay at Christmas, “for reverence of 
 the Son of God, whom on such a night the most Blessed Virgin Mary did lay down 
 in the stall betwixt the ox and the ass.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-32">13-32</a><a name="Nanchor_13-32"></a> It was a gracious thought, and no doubt with St. 
 Francis, as with the old Cheshireman, it was a purely Christian one; very 
 possibly, however, the original object of such attention to the dumb creatures 
 was to bring to the animals, by means of the corn, the influence of the spirit 
 of fertility.</p>
 <p>In Silesia on Christmas night all the beasts are given wheat to make them 
 thrive, and it is believed that if wheat be kept in the pocket during the 
 Christmas service and then given to fowls, it will make them grow fat and lay 
 many eggs.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-33">13-33</a><a name="Nanchor_13-33"></a> In Sweden on Christmas Eve the cattle are given the 
 best forage the house can afford, and afterwards a mess of all the viands of 
 which their masters have partaken; the horses are given the choicest hay and, 
 later on, ale; and the other animals are treated to good things.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-34">13-34</a><a name="Nanchor_13-34"></a> </p>
 <p>At Loblang in Hungary the last sheaf at harvest is kept, and given on New 
 Year's morning to the wild birds.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-35">13-35</a><a name="Nanchor_13-35"></a> In southern Germany corn is put on the roof for them 
 on Christmas Eve, or,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-36">13-36</a><a name="Nanchor_13-36"></a> as also in Sweden,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-37">13-37</a><a name="Nanchor_13-37"></a> an unthreshed sheaf is set on a pole. In these cases 
 it is possible that the food was originally an offering to ancestral or other 
 spirits.</p>
 <p><i>Revenons à nos gâteaux.</i> In Rome and elsewhere in Italy an important 
 article of Christmas food is the <i>panettone</i>, a currant loaf. <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a> <a name="Page_290"></a>Such loaves are sent as presents to friends. In eastern 
 Europe, too, Christmas loaves or cakes are very conspicuous. The 
 <i>chesnitza</i> and <i>kolatch</i> cakes among the southern Slavs are flat and 
 wheel-like, with a circular hole in the middle and a number of lines radiating 
 from it. In the central hole is sometimes placed a lighted taper or a small 
 Christmas-tree hung with ribbons, tinsel, and sweetmeats. These cakes, made with 
 elaborate ceremonial early in the morning, are solemnly broken by the 
 house-father on Christmas Day, and a small piece is eaten by each member of the 
 family. In some places one is fixed on the horn of the “eldest ox,” and if he 
 throws it off it is a good sign.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-38">13-38</a><a name="Nanchor_13-38"></a> The last practice may be compared with a 
 Herefordshire custom which we shall meet with on Twelfth Night (p.  <a href="crt20.htm#Page_346">346</a>).</p>
 <p>In southern Greece a special kind of flat loaves with a cross on the top is 
 made on Christmas Eve. The name given is “Christ's Loaves.” “The cloth is not 
 removed from the table; but everything is left as it is in the belief that 
 Christ will come and eat during the night.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-39">13-39</a><a name="Nanchor_13-39"></a> Probably Christ has here taken the place of 
 ancestral spirits.</p>
 <p>In Tyrol peasants eat at Christmastide the so-called <i>zelten</i>, a kind of 
 pie filled with dried pear-slices, nuts, figs, raisins, and the like. It is 
 baked on the Eve of St. Thomas, and its filling is as important an event for the 
 whole family as was the plum-pudding and mincemeat making in old-fashioned 
 English households. When the <i>zelten</i> is filled the sign of the cross is 
 made upon it and it is sprinkled with holy water and put in the oven. When baked 
 and cooled, it is laid in the family stock of rye and is not eaten until St. 
 Stephen's Day or Epiphany. Its cutting by the father of the family is a matter 
 of considerable solemnity. Smaller pies are made at the same time for the 
 maid-servants, and a curious custom is connected with them. It is usual for the 
 maids to visit their relations during the Christmas holidays and share with them 
 their <i>zelten</i>. A young man who wishes to be engaged to a maid should offer 
 to carry her pie for her. This is his declaration of love, and if she accepts 
 the offer she signifies her approval of him. To him falls the duty or privilege 
 of cutting the <i>zelten</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-40">13-40</a><a name="Nanchor_13-40"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 291</font></a> <a name="Page_291"></a>Other cake customs are associated with the Epiphany, and 
 will be considered in connection with that festival. We may here in conclusion 
 notice a few further articles of Christmas good cheer.</p>
 <p>In Italy and Spain﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-41">13-41</a><a name="Nanchor_13-41"></a> a sort of nougat known as <i>torrone</i> or 
 <i>turron</i> is eaten at Christmas. You may buy it even in London in the 
 Italian quarter; in Eyre Street Hill it is sold on Christmas Eve on little 
 gaily-decked street stalls. Its use may well be a survival of the Roman custom 
 of giving sweet things at the Kalends in order that the year might be full of 
 sweetness.</p>
 <p>Some Little Russian feasting customs are probably pagan in origin, but have 
 received a curious Christian interpretation. All Little Russians sit down to 
 honey and porridge on Christmas Eve. They call it <i>koutia</i>, and cherish the 
 custom as something that distinguishes them from Great and White Russians. Each 
 dish is said to represent the Holy Crib. First porridge is put in, which is like 
 putting straw in the manger; then each person helps himself to honey and fruit, 
 and that symbolizes the Babe. A place is made in the porridge, and then the 
 honey and fruit are poured in; the fruit stands for the body, the honey for the 
 spirit or the blood.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-42">13-42</a><a name="Nanchor_13-42"></a> </p>
 <p>Something like this is the special dish eaten in every Roumanian peasant 
 household on Christmas Eve﻿—the <i>turte</i>. It is made up of a pile of thin 
 dry leaves of dough, with melted sugar or honey, or powdered walnut, or the 
 juice of the hemp-seed. The <i>turte</i> are traditionally said to represent the 
 swaddling clothes of the Holy Child.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-43">13-43</a><a name="Nanchor_13-43"></a> </p>
 <p>In Poland a few weeks before Christmas monks bring round small packages of 
 wafers made of flour and water, blessed by a priest, and with figures stamped 
 upon them. No Polish family is without these <i>oplatki</i>; they are sent in 
 letters to relations and friends, as we send Christmas cards. When the first 
 star appears on Christmas Eve the whole family, beginning with the eldest 
 member, break one of these wafers between themselves, at the same time 
 exchanging good wishes. Afterwards the master and mistress go to the servants 
 quarters to divide the wafer there.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-44">13-44</a><a name="Nanchor_13-44"></a> </p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a> <a name="Page_292"></a><span class="smcap">Relics of Sacrifice.</span></h3>
 <p>We have noted a connection, partial at least, between Christmas good cheer 
 and sacrifice; let us now glance at a few customs of a different character but 
 seemingly of sacrificial origin.</p>
 <p>Traces of sacrifices of cats and dogs are to be found in Germany and Bohemia. 
 In Lauenburg and Mecklenburg on Christmas morning, before the cattle are 
 watered, a dog is thrown into their drinking water, in order that they may not 
 suffer from the mange. In the Uckermark a cat may be substituted for the dog. In 
 Bohemia a black cat is caught, boiled, and buried by night under a tree, to keep 
 evil spirits from injuring the fields.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-45">13-45</a><a name="Nanchor_13-45"></a> </p>
 <p>A strange Christmas custom is the “hunting of the wren,” once widespread in 
 England and France and still practised in Ireland. In the Isle of Man very early 
 on Christmas morning, when the church bells had rung out midnight, servants went 
 out to hunt the wren. They killed the bird, fastened it to the top of a long 
 pole, and carried it in procession to every house, chanting these words:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“We hunted the wren for Robin the 
 Bobbin,</span><br><span class="i3">We hunted the wren for Jack of the 
 Can,</span><br><span class="i2">We hunted the wren for Robin the 
 Bobbin,</span><br><span class="i3">We hunted the wren for every 
 one.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>At each house they sought to collect money. At last, when all had been 
 visited, they laid the wren on a bier, carried it to the churchyard, and buried 
 it with the utmost solemnity, singing Manx dirges. Another account, from the 
 mid-nineteenth century, describes how on St. Stephen's Day Manx boys went from 
 door to door with a wren suspended by the legs in the centre of two hoops 
 crossing one another at right angles and decorated with evergreens and ribbons. 
 In exchange for a small coin they would give a feather of the wren, which was 
 carefully kept as a preservative against shipwreck during the year.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_110">110</a><a name="FNanchor_110"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-46">13-46</a><a name="Nanchor_13-46"></a> <a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 293</font></a> <a name="Page_293"></a>There are also traces of a Manx custom of boiling and 
 eating the bird.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-48">13-48</a><a name="Nanchor_13-48"></a> </p>
 <p>The wren is popularly called “the king of birds,” and it is supposed to be 
 highly unlucky to kill one at ordinary times. Probably it was once regarded as 
 sacred, and the Christmas “hunting” is the survival of an annual custom of 
 slaying the divine animal, such as is found among primitive peoples.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-49">13-49</a><a name="Nanchor_13-49"></a> The carrying of its body from door to door is 
 apparently intended to convey to each house a portion of its virtues, while the 
 actual eating of the bird would be a sort of communion feast. Perhaps the 
 custom, in a Cornish village, of eating blackbird pie on Twelfth Day should be 
 explained in the same way.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-50">13-50</a><a name="Nanchor_13-50"></a> </p>
 <p>I can here hardly do more than allude to the many games﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-51">13-51</a><a name="Nanchor_13-51"></a> that were traditional in England at 
 Christmas﻿—hoodman-blind, shoe the wild mare, hot cockles, steal the white loaf, 
 snap-dragon, and the rest. To attempt to describe and explain them would lead me 
 too far, but it is highly probable that some at least might be traced to an 
 origin in sacrificial ritual. The degeneration of religious rites into mere play 
 is, indeed, as we have seen, a process illustrated by the whole history of 
 Christmas.</p>
 <p>Only two British Christmas games can be discussed in this book: blindman's 
 buff and football. An account of a remarkable Christmas football match will be 
 found in the chapter on Epiphany customs, where it is brought into connection 
 with that closely related game, the “Haxey hood.”</p>
 <p>As for blindman's buff, it is distinctly a Christmas sport, and it is known 
 nearly all over Europe by names derived from animals, <i>e.g.</i>, “blind cow” 
 and “blind mouse.” Mr. N. W. Thomas has suggested that “the explanation of these 
 names is that the players originally wore masks; the game is known in some cases 
 as the blinde Mumm, or blind mask.... The player who is it seems to be the 
 sacrificer; he bears the same name as the victim, just as in agricultural 
 customs the reaper of the last corn bears the same name as the last sheaf.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-52">13-52</a><a name="Nanchor_13-52"></a> </p>
 <p>The Scandinavian countries are very rich in Christmas games and dances,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-53">13-53</a><a name="Nanchor_13-53"></a> of which it would be interesting to attempt 
 explanations if space allowed. One Swedish song and dance game﻿—it <a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 294</font></a> <a name="Page_294"></a>may be related to the sword-dance (see  <a href="crt17.htm#Chapter_XIII">XIII</a>)﻿—is obviously sacrificial. Several youths, with blackened faces and 
 persons disguised, are the performers. One of them is put to death with a knife 
 by a woman in hideous attire. Afterwards, with gross gestures, she dances with 
 the victim.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-54">13-54</a><a name="Nanchor_13-54"></a> According to another account, from Gothland, the 
 victim sits clad in a skin, holding in his mouth a wisp of straw cut sharp at 
 the ends and standing out. It has been conjectured that this is meant to 
 resemble a swine's bristles, and that the man represents a hog sacrificed to 
 Frey.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-55">13-55</a><a name="Nanchor_13-55"></a> </p>
 <p>Lastly a Russian game may be mentioned, though it has no sacrificial 
 suggestion. During the Christmas season girls play at what is called “the Burial 
 of the Gold.” They form a circle, with one girl standing in the centre, and pass 
 from hand to hand a gold ring, which the maiden inside tries to detect. 
 Meanwhile a song is sung, “Gold I bury, gold I bury.” Some imaginative 
 mythologists interpret the ring as representing the sun, buried by the clouds of 
 winter.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_13-56">13-56</a><a name="Nanchor_13-56"></a> </p>
