 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">The Christmas-tree.</span></h3>
 <p>The most widespread, and to children the most delightful, of all festal 
 institutions is the Christmas-tree. Its picturesqueness and gay charm have made 
 it spread rapidly all over Europe without roots in national tradition, for, as 
 most people know, it is a German creation, and even in Germany it attained its 
 present immense popularity only in the nineteenth century. To Germany, of 
 course, one should go to see the tree in all its glory. Many people, indeed, 
 maintain that no other Christmas can compare with the German <i>Weihnacht</i>. 
 “It is,” writes Miss I. A. R. Wylie, “that childish, open-hearted simplicity 
 which, so it seems to me, makes Christmas essentially German, or at any rate 
 explains why it is that nowhere else in the world does it find so pure an 
 expression. The German is himself simple, warm-hearted, unpretentious, with 
 something at the bottom of him which is childlike in the best sense. He is the 
 last Naturmensch in civilization.” Christmas suits him “as well as a play 
 suits an actor for whose character and temperament it has been especially 
 written.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-1">12-1</a><a name="Nanchor_12-1"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a> <a name="Page_264"></a>In Germany the Christmas-tree is not a luxury for 
 well-to-do people as in England, but a necessity, the very centre of the 
 festival; no one is too poor or too lonely to have one. There is something about 
 a German <i>Weihnachtsbaum</i>﻿—a romance and a wonder﻿—that English 
 Christmas-trees do not possess. For one thing, perhaps, in a land of forests the 
 tree seems more in place; it is a kind of sacrament linking mankind to the 
 mysteries of the woodland. Again the German tree is simply a thing of beauty and 
 radiance; no utilitarian presents hang from its boughs﻿—they are laid apart on a 
 table﻿—and the tree is purely splendour for splendour's sake. However tawdry it 
 may look by day, at night it is a true thing of wonder, shining with countless 
 lights and glittering ornaments, with fruit of gold and shimmering festoons of 
 silver. Then there is the solemnity with which it is surrounded; the long secret 
 preparations behind the closed doors, and, when Christmas Eve arrives, the 
 sudden revelation of hidden glory. The Germans have quite a religious feeling 
 for their <i>Weihnachtsbaum</i>, coming down, one may fancy, from some dim 
 ancestral worship of the trees of the wood.</p>
 <p>As Christmas draws near the market-place in a German town is filled with a 
 miniature forest of firs; the trees are sold by old women in quaint costumes, 
 and the shop-windows are full of candles and ornaments to deck them. Mrs. Alfred 
 Sidgwick in her “Home Life in Germany” gives a delightful picture of such a 
 Christmas market in “one of the old German cities in the hill country, when the 
 streets and the open places are covered with crisp clean snow, and the mountains 
 are white with it.... The air is cold and still, and heavy with the scent of the 
 Christmas-trees brought from the forest for the pleasure of the children. Day by 
 day you see the rows of them growing thinner, and if you go to the market on 
 Christmas Eve itself you will find only a few trees left out in the cold. The 
 market is empty, the peasants are harnessing their horses or their oxen, the 
 women are packing up their unsold goods. In every home in the city one of the 
 trees that scented the open air a week ago is shining now with lights and little 
 gilded nuts and apples, and is helping to make that Christmas smell, all compact 
 of the pine forest, wax <a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a> <a name="Page_265"></a>candles, cakes and painted toys, you must associate so long 
 as you live with Christmas in Germany.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-2">12-2</a><a name="Nanchor_12-2"></a> </p>
 <p>Even in London one may get a glimpse of the Teutonic Christmas in the 
 half-German streets round Fitzroy Square. They are bald and drab enough, but at 
 Christmas here and there a window shines with a lighted tree, and the very 
 prosaic Lutheran church in Cleveland Street has an unwonted sight to show﻿—two 
 great fir-trees decked with white candles, standing one on each side of the 
 pulpit. The church of the German Catholics, too, St. Boniface's, Whitechapel, 
 has in its sanctuary two Christmas-trees strangely gay with coloured glistening 
 balls and long strands of gold and silver <i>engelshaar</i>. The candles are lit 
 at Benediction during the festival, and between the shining trees the solemn 
 ritual is performed by the priest and a crowd of serving boys in scarlet and 
 white with tapers and incense.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">There is a pretty story about the institution of the 
 <i>Weihnachtsbaum</i> by Martin Luther: how, after wandering one Christmas Eve 
 under the clear winter sky lit by a thousand stars, he set up for his children a 
 tree with countless candles, an image of the starry heaven whence Christ came 
 down. This, however, belongs to the region of legend; the first historical 
 mention of the Christmas-tree is found in the notes of a certain Strasburg 
 citizen of unknown name, written in the year 1605. “At Christmas,” he writes, 
 “they set up fir-trees in the parlours at Strasburg and hang thereon roses cut 
 out of many-coloured paper, apples, wafers, gold-foil, sweets, &amp;c.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-3">12-3</a><a name="Nanchor_12-3"></a> </p>
 <p>We next meet with the tree in a hostile allusion by a distinguished Strasburg 
 theologian, Dr. Johann Konrad Dannhauer, Professor and Preacher at the 
 Cathedral. In his book, “The Milk of the Catechism,” published about the middle 
 of the seventeenth century, he speaks of “the Christmas- or fir-tree, which 
 people set up in their houses, hang with dolls and sweets, and afterwards shake 
 and deflower.” “Whence comes the custom,” he says, “I know not; it is child's 
 play.... Far better were it to point the children to the spiritual cedar-tree, 
 Jesus Christ.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-4">12-4</a><a name="Nanchor_12-4"></a> </p>
 <p>In neither of these references is there any mention of candles﻿—the <a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a> <a name="Page_266"></a>most fascinating feature of the modern tree. These appear, 
 however, in a Latin work on Christmas presents by Karl Gottfried Kissling of the 
 University of Wittenberg, written in 1737. He tells how a certain country lady 
 of his acquaintance set up a little tree for each of her sons and daughters, lit 
 candles on or around the trees, laid out presents beneath them, and called her 
 children one by one into the room to take the trees and gifts intended for 
 them.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-5">12-5</a><a name="Nanchor_12-5"></a> </p>
 <p>With the advance of the eighteenth-century notices of the 
 <i>Weihnachtsbaum</i> become more frequent: Jung Stilling, Goethe, Schiller, and 
 others mention it, and about the end of the century its use seems to have been 
 fairly general in Germany.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-6">12-6</a><a name="Nanchor_12-6"></a> In many places, however, it was not common till well 
 on in the eighteen hundreds: it was a Protestant rather than a Catholic 
 institution, and it made its way but slowly in regions where the older faith was 
 held.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-7">12-7</a><a name="Nanchor_12-7"></a> Well-to-do townspeople welcomed it first, and the 
 peasantry were slow to adopt it. In Old Bavaria, for instance, in 1855 it was 
 quite unknown in country places, and even to-day it is not very common there, 
 except in the towns.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-8">12-8</a><a name="Nanchor_12-8"></a> “It is more in vogue on the whole,” wrote Dr. Tille in 
 1893, “in the Protestant north than in the Catholic south,”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-9">12-9</a><a name="Nanchor_12-9"></a> but its popularity was rapidly growing at that 
 time.</p>
 <p>A common substitute for the Christmas-tree in Saxony during the nineteenth 
 century, and one still found in country places, was the so-called “pyramid,” a 
 wooden erection adorned with many-coloured paper and with lights. These pyramids 
 were very popular among the smaller <i>bourgeoisie</i> and artisans, and were 
 kept from one Christmas to another.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-10">12-10</a><a name="Nanchor_12-10"></a> In Berlin, too, the pyramid was once very common. It 
 was there adorned with green twigs as well as with candles and coloured paper, 
 and had more resemblance to the Christmas-tree.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-11">12-11</a><a name="Nanchor_12-11"></a> Tieck refers to it in his story, “Weihnacht-Abend” 
 (1805).﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-12">12-12</a><a name="Nanchor_12-12"></a> </p>
 <p>Pyramids, without lights apparently, were known in England before 1840. In 
 Hertfordshire they were formed of gilt evergreens, apples, and nuts, and were 
 carried about just before Christmas for presents. In Herefordshire they were 
 known at the New Year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-13">12-13</a><a name="Nanchor_12-13"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a> <a name="Page_267"></a>The Christmas-tree was introduced into France in 1840, when 
 Princess Helene of Mecklenburg brought it to Paris. In 1890 between thirty and 
 thirty-five thousand of the trees are said to have been sold in Paris.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-14">12-14</a><a name="Nanchor_12-14"></a> </p>
 <p>In England it is alluded to in 1789,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-15">12-15</a><a name="Nanchor_12-15"></a> but its use did not become at all general until 
 about the eighteen-forties. In 1840 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had a 
 Christmas-tree, and the fashion spread until it became completely 
 naturalized.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-16">12-16</a><a name="Nanchor_12-16"></a> In Denmark and Norway it was known in 1830, and in 
 Sweden in 1863 (among the Swedish population on the coast of Finland it seems to 
 have been in use in 1800).﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-17">12-17</a><a name="Nanchor_12-17"></a> In Bohemia it is mentioned in 1862.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-18">12-18</a><a name="Nanchor_12-18"></a> It is also found in Russia, the United States, 
 Spain, Italy, and Holland,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-19">12-19</a><a name="Nanchor_12-19"></a> and of course in Switzerland and Austria, so largely 
 German in language and customs. In non-German countries it is rather a thing for 
 the well-to-do classes than for the masses of the people.</p>
 <p>The Christmas-tree is essentially a domestic institution. It has, however, 
 found its way into Protestant churches in Germany and from them into Catholic 
 churches. Even the Swiss Zwinglians, with all their Puritanism, do not exclude 
 it from their bare, white-washed fanes. In the Münsterthal, for instance, a 
 valley of Romonsch speech, off the Lower Engadine, a tree decked with candles, 
 festoons, presents, and serpent-squibs, stands in church at Christmas, and it is 
 difficult for the minister to conduct service, for all the time, except during 
 the prayers, the people are letting off fireworks. On one day between Christmas 
 Eve and New Year there is a great present-giving in church.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-20">12-20</a><a name="Nanchor_12-20"></a> </p>
 <p>In Munich, and doubtless elsewhere, the tree appears not only in the church 
 and in the home, but in the cemetery. The graves of the dead are decked on 
 Christmas Eve with holly and mistletoe and a little Christmas-tree with gleaming 
 lights, a touching token of remembrance, an attempt, perhaps, to give the 
 departed a share in the brightness of the festival.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-21">12-21</a><a name="Nanchor_12-21"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">The question of the origin of Christmas-trees is of great 
 interest. Though their affinity to other sacraments of the <a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a> <a name="Page_268"></a>vegetation-spirit is evident, it is difficult to be certain 
 of their exact ancestry. Dr. Tille regards them as coming from a union of two 
 elements: the old Roman custom of decking houses with laurels and green trees at 
 the Kalends of January, and the popular belief that every Christmas Eve apple 
 and other trees blossomed and bore fruit.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-22">12-22</a><a name="Nanchor_12-22"></a> </p>
 <p>Before the advent of the Christmas-tree proper﻿—a fir with lights and 
 ornaments often imitating and always suggesting flowers and fruit﻿—it was 
 customary to put trees like cherry or hawthorn into water or into pots indoors, 
 so that they might bud and blossom at New Year or Christmas.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-23">12-23</a><a name="Nanchor_12-23"></a> Even to-day the practice of picking boughs in order 
 that they may blossom at Christmas is to be found in some parts of Austria. In 
 Carinthia girls on St. Lucia's Day (December 13) stick a cherry-branch into 
 wet sand; if it blooms at Christmas their wishes will be fulfilled. In other 
 parts the branches﻿—pear as well as cherry﻿—are picked on St. Barbara's Day 
 (December 4), and in South Tyrol cherry-trees are manured with lime on the 
 first Thursday in Advent so that they may blossom at Christmas.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-24">12-24</a><a name="Nanchor_12-24"></a> The custom may have had to do with legendary lore 
 about the marvellous transformation of Nature on the night of Christ's birth, 
 when the rivers ran wine instead of water and trees stood in full blossom in 
 spite of ice and snow.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-25">12-25</a><a name="Nanchor_12-25"></a> </p>
 <p>In England there was an old belief in trees blossoming at Christmas, 
 connected with the well-known legend of St. Joseph of Arimathea. When the saint 
 settled at Glastonbury he planted his staff in the earth and it put forth 
 leaves; moreover it blossomed every Christmas Eve. Not only the original thorn 
 at Glastonbury but trees of the same species in other parts of England had this 
 characteristic. When in 1752 the New Style was substituted for the Old, making 
 Christmas fall twelve days earlier, folks were curious to see what the thorns 
 would do. At Quainton in Buckinghamshire two thousand people, it is said, went 
 out on the new Christmas Eve to view a blackthorn which had the Christmas 
 blossoming habit. As no sign of buds was visible they agreed that the new 
 Christmas could not be right, and refused to keep it. At Glastonbury itself 
 nothing <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a> <a name="Page_269"></a>happened on December 24, but on January 5, the 
 right day according to the Old Style, the thorn blossomed as usual.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_102">102</a><a name="FNanchor_102"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-26">12-26</a><a name="Nanchor_12-26"></a> </p>
 <p>Let us turn to the customs of the Roman Empire which may be in part 
 responsible for the German Christmas-tree. The practice of adorning houses with 
 evergreens at the January Kalends was common throughout the Empire, as we learn 
 from Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom. A grim denunciation of such 
 decorations and the lights which accompanied them may be quoted from Tertullian; 
 it makes a pregnant contrast of pagan and Christian. “Let them,” he says of the 
 heathen, “kindle lamps, they who have no light; let them fix on the doorposts 
 laurels which shall afterwards be burnt, they for whom fire is close at hand; 
 meet for them are testimonies of darkness and auguries of punishment. But thou,” 
 he says to the Christian, “art a light of the world and a tree that is ever 
 green; if thou hast renounced temples, make not a temple of thy own 
 house-door.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-27">12-27</a><a name="Nanchor_12-27"></a> </p>
 <p>That these New Year practices of the Empire had to do with the 
 <i>Weihnachtsbaum</i> is very possible, but on the other hand it has closer 
 parallels in certain folk-customs that in no way suggest Roman or Greek 
 influence. Not only at Christmas are ceremonial “trees” to be found in Germany. 
 In the Erzgebirge there is dancing at the summer solstice round “St. John's 
 tree,” a pyramid decked with garlands and flowers, and lit up at night by 
 candles.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-28">12-28</a><a name="Nanchor_12-28"></a> At midsummer “in the towns of the Upper Harz 
 Mountains tall fir-trees, with the bark peeled off their lower trunks, were set 
 up in open places and decked with flowers and eggs, which were painted yellow 
 and red. Round these trees the young folk danced by day and the old folk in the 
 evening”;﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-29">12-29</a><a name="Nanchor_12-29"></a> while on Dutch ground in Gelderland and Limburg at 
 the beginning of May trees were adorned with lights.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-30">12-30</a><a name="Nanchor_12-30"></a> </p>
 <p>Nearer to Christmas is a New Year's custom found in some <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a> <a name="Page_270"></a>Alsatian villages: the adorning of the fountain with a 
 “May.” The girls who visit the fountain procure a small fir-tree or holly-bush, 
 and deck it with ribbons, egg-shells, and little figures representing a shepherd 
 or a man beating his wife. This is set up above the fountain on New Year's Eve. 
 On the evening of the next day the snow is carefully cleared away and the girls 
 dance and sing around the fountain. The lads may only take part in the dance by 
 permission of the girls. The tree is kept all through the year as a protection 
 to those who have set it up.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-31">12-31</a><a name="Nanchor_12-31"></a> </p>
 <p>In Sweden, before the advent of the German type of tree, it was customary to 
 place young pines, divested of bark and branches, outside the houses at 
 Christmastide.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-32">12-32</a><a name="Nanchor_12-32"></a> An English parallel which does not suggest any 
 borrowing from Germany, was formerly to be found at Brough in Westmoreland on 
 Twelfth Night. A holly-tree with torches attached to its branches was carried 
 through the town in procession. It was finally thrown among the populace, who 
 divided into two parties, one of which endeavoured to take the tree to one inn, 
 and the other, to a rival hostelry.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-33">12-33</a><a name="Nanchor_12-33"></a> We have here pretty plainly a struggle of two 
 factions﻿—perhaps of two quarters of a town that were once separate 
 villages﻿—for the possession of a sacred object.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_103">103</a><a name="FNanchor_103"></a></p>
 <p>We may find parallels, lastly, in two remote corners of Europe. In the island 
 of Chios﻿—here we are on Greek ground﻿—tenants are wont to offer to their 
 landlords on Christmas morning a <i>rhamna</i>, a pole with wreaths of myrtle, 
 olive, and orange leaves bound around it; “to these are fixed any flowers that 
 may be found﻿—geraniums, anemones, and the like, and, by way of further 
 decoration, oranges, lemons, and strips of gold and coloured paper.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_104">104</a><a name="FNanchor_104"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-34">12-34</a><a name="Nanchor_12-34"></a> Secondly, among the Circassians in the early half of 
 the nineteenth century, a young pear-tree used to be carried into each house at 
 an autumn festival, to the sound of music and joyous cries. It was covered with 
 candles, and a cheese was fastened to its top. Round about it they ate, drank, 
 and sang. Afterwards it was <a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a> <a name="Page_271"></a>removed to the courtyard, where it remained for the rest of 
 the year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-36">12-36</a><a name="Nanchor_12-36"></a> </p>
 <p>Though there is no recorded instance of the use of a tree at Christmas in 
 Germany before the seventeenth century, the <i>Weihnachtsbaum</i> may well be a 
 descendant of some sacred tree carried about or set up at the 
 beginning-of-winter festival. All things considered, it seems to belong to a 
 class of primitive sacraments of which the example most familiar to English 
 peoples is the May-pole. This is, of course, an early summer institution, but in 
 France and Germany a Harvest May is also known﻿—a large branch or a whole tree, 
 which is decked with ears of corn, brought home on the last waggon from the 
 harvest field, and fastened to the roof of farmhouse or barn, where it remains 
 for a year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-37">12-37</a><a name="Nanchor_12-37"></a> Mannhardt has shown that such sacraments embody the 
 tree-spirit conceived as the spirit of vegetation in general, and are believed 
 to convey its life-giving, fructifying influences. Probably the idea of contact 
 with the spirit of growth lay also beneath the Roman evergreen decorations, so 
 that whether or not we connect the Christmas-tree with these, the principle at 
 the bottom is the same.</p>
 <p>Certain Christian ideas, finally, besides that of trees blossoming on the 
 night of the Nativity, may have affected the fortunes of the Christmas-tree. 
 December 24 was in old Church calendars the day of Adam and Eve, the idea 
 being that Christ the second Adam had repaired by His Incarnation the loss 
 caused by the sin of the first. A legend grew up that Adam when he left Paradise 
 took with him an apple or sprout from the Tree of Knowledge, and that from this 
 sprang the tree from which the Cross was made. Or it was said that on Adam's 
 grave grew a sprig from the Tree of Life, and that from it Christ plucked the 
 fruit of redemption. The Cross in early Christian poetry was conceived as the 
 Tree of Life planted anew, bearing the glorious fruit of Christ's body, and 
 repairing the mischief wrought by the misuse of the first tree. We may recall a 
 verse from the “Pange, lingua” of Passiontide:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Faithful Cross! above all 
 other,</span><br><span class="i3">One and only noble tree!<a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a> <a name="Page_272"></a></span><br><span class="i2">None in foliage, none in 
 blossom,</span><br><span class="i3">None in fruit thy peer may be:</span><br><span class="i2">Sweetest wood and sweetest iron!</span><br><span class="i3">Sweetest 
 weight is hung on thee.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>In the religious Christmas plays the tree of Paradise was sometimes shown to 
 the people. At Oberufer, for instance, it was a fine juniper-tree, adorned with 
 apples and ribbons. Sometimes Christ Himself was regarded as the tree of 
 Paradise.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-38">12-38</a><a name="Nanchor_12-38"></a> The thought of Him as both the Light of the World 
 and the Tree of Life may at least have given a Christian meaning to the 
 light-bearing tree, and helped to establish its popularity among pious folk.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Christmas Decorations.</span></h3>
 <p>We have seen that the Christmas-tree may be a development, partly at least, 
 from the custom of decorating buildings with evergreens at the New Year, and 
 that such decorations were common throughout the Roman Empire.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_105">105</a><a name="FNanchor_105"></a> Some further consideration may now be given to the 
 subject of Christmas decorations in various lands. In winter, when all is brown 
 and dead, the evergreens are manifestations of the abiding life within the 
 plant-world, and they may well have been used as sacramental means of contact 
 with the spirit of growth and fertility, threatened by the powers of blight. 
 Particularly precious would be plants like the holly, the ivy, and the 
 mistletoe, which actually bore fruit in the winter-time.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-39">12-39</a><a name="Nanchor_12-39"></a> </p>
 <p>In spite of ecclesiastical condemnations of Kalends decorations﻿—as late as 
 the sixth century the <i>capitula</i> of Bishop Martin of Braga forbid the 
 adorning of houses with laurels and green trees﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-40">12-40</a><a name="Nanchor_12-40"></a> ﻿—the custom has found its way even into churches, 
 and nowhere more than in England. At least as far back as the fifteenth century, 
 according to Stow's “Survay of London,” it was the custom at Christmas for 
 “every man's house, as also the parish churches,” to be “decked with holm, ivy, 
 bays, and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green. The conduits 
 and <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a> <a name="Page_273"></a>standards in the streets were likewise garnished.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-41">12-41</a><a name="Nanchor_12-41"></a> Many people of the last generation will remember the 
 old English mode of decoration﻿—how sprigs of holly and yew, stuck into holes in 
 the high pews, used to make the churches into miniature forests. Only upon the 
 mistletoe does a trace of the ecclesiastical taboo remain, and even that is not 
 universal, for at York Minster, for instance, some was laid upon the altar.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-42">12-42</a><a name="Nanchor_12-42"></a> </p>
 <p>English popular custom has connected particular plants with the winter 
 festival in a peculiarly delightful way; at the mere mention of holly or 
 mistletoe the picture of Christmas with its country charm rises to the mind﻿—we 
 think of snowy fields and distant bells, of warm hearths and kindly 
 merrymaking.</p>
 <p>It is no wonder that the mistletoe has a special place in Christmas 
 decorations, for it is associated with both Teutonic myth and Celtic ritual. It 
 was with mistletoe that the beloved Balder was shot, and the plant played an 
 important part in a Druidic ceremony described by Pliny. A white-robed Druid 
 climbed a sacred oak and cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle. As it fell it 
 was caught in a white cloth, and two white bulls were then sacrificed, with 
 prayer. The mistletoe was called “all-healer” and was believed to be a remedy 
 against poison and to make barren animals fruitful.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-43">12-43</a><a name="Nanchor_12-43"></a> The significance of the ritual is not easy to find. 
 Pliny's account, Dr. MacCulloch has suggested, may be incomplete, and the 
 cutting of the mistletoe may have been a preliminary to some other 
 ceremony﻿—perhaps the felling of the tree on which it grew, whose soul was 
 supposed to be in it, or perhaps the slaying of a representative of the 
 tree-spirit; while the white oxen of Pliny's time may have replaced a human 
 victim.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-44">12-44</a><a name="Nanchor_12-44"></a> </p>
 <p>It is interesting to find that the name “all-healer” is still given to the 
 mistletoe in Celtic speech,﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_106">106</a><a name="FNanchor_106"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-45">12-45</a><a name="Nanchor_12-45"></a> and that in various European countries it is 
 believed to possess marvellous powers of healing sickness or averting 
 misfortune.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-46">12-46</a><a name="Nanchor_12-46"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a> <a name="Page_274"></a>It is hard to say exactly what is the origin of the English 
 “kissing under the mistletoe,” but the practice would appear to be due to an 
 imagined relation between the love of the sexes and the spirit of fertility 
 embodied in the sacred bough, and it may be a vestige of the licence often 
 permitted at folk-festivals. According to one form of the English custom the 
 young men plucked, each time they kissed a girl, a berry from the bough. When 
 the berries were all picked, the privilege ceased.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-48">12-48</a><a name="Nanchor_12-48"></a> </p>
 <p>Sometimes a curious form, reminding one both of the German Christmas-tree and 
 of the <i>Krippe</i>, is taken by the “kissing bunch.” Here is an account from 
 Derbyshire:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“The kissing bunch is always an elaborate affair. The size depends upon 
   the couple of hoops﻿—one thrust through the other﻿—which form its skeleton. 
   Each of the ribs is garlanded with holly, ivy, and sprigs of other greens, 
   with bits of coloured ribbons and paper roses, rosy-cheeked apples, specially 
   reserved for this occasion, and oranges. Three small dolls are also prepared, 
   often with much taste, and these represent our Saviour, the mother of Jesus, 
   and Joseph. These dolls generally hang within the kissing bunch by strings 
   from the top, and are surrounded by apples, oranges tied to strings, and 
   various brightly coloured ornaments. Occasionally, however, the dolls are 
   arranged in the kissing bunch to represent a manger-scene.... Mistletoe is not 
   very plentiful in Derbyshire; but, generally, a bit is obtainable, and this is 
   carefully tied to the bottom of the kissing bunch, which is then hung in the 
   middle of the house-place, the centre of attention during Christmastide.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-49">12-49</a><a name="Nanchor_12-49"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>Kissing under the mistletoe seems to be distinctively English. There is, 
 however, a New Year's Eve custom in Lower Austria and the Rhaetian Alps that 
 somewhat resembles our mistletoe bough practices. People linger late in the 
 inns, the walls and windows of which are decorated with green pine-twigs. In the 
 centre of the inn-parlour hangs from a roof-beam a wreath of the same greenery, 
 and in a dark corner hides a masked figure known as “Sylvester,” old and ugly, 
 with a flaxen beard and <i>a wreath of mistletoe</i>. If a youth or maiden 
 happens to pass under the pine wreath Sylvester springs out and imprints a rough 
 kiss. When midnight comes he is driven out as the representative of the old 
 year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-50">12-50</a><a name="Nanchor_12-50"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a> <a name="Page_275"></a>There are traces in Britain of the sacredness of holly as 
 well as mistletoe. In Northumberland it is used for divination: nine leaves are 
 taken and tied with nine knots into a handkerchief, and put under the pillow by 
 a person who desires prophetic dreams.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-51">12-51</a><a name="Nanchor_12-51"></a> For this purpose smooth leaves (without prickles) 
 must be employed, and it is to be noted that at Burford in Shropshire smooth 
 holly only was used for the Christmas decorations.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-52">12-52</a><a name="Nanchor_12-52"></a> Holly is hated by witches,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-53">12-53</a><a name="Nanchor_12-53"></a> but perhaps this may be due not to any pre-Christian 
 sanctity attached to it but to the association of its thorns and blood-red 
 berries with the Passion﻿—an association to which it owes its Danish name, 
 <i>Kristdorn</i>.</p>
 <p>In some old English Christmas carols holly and ivy are put into a curious 
 antagonism, apparently connected with a contest of the sexes. Holly is the men's 
 plant, ivy the women's, and the carols are debates as to the respective merits 
 of each. Possibly some sort of rude drama may once have been performed.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-54">12-54</a><a name="Nanchor_12-54"></a> Here is a fifteenth-century example of these 
 carols:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Holly and Ivy made a great 
 party,</span><br><span class="i2">Who should have the mastery,</span><br><span class="i3">In landës where they go.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Then spoke Holly, I am free and 
 jolly,</span><br><span class="i2">I will have the mastery,</span><br><span class="i3">In landës where we go.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Then spake Ivy, I am lov'd and 
 prov'd,</span><br><span class="i2">And I will have the mastery,</span><br><span class="i3">In landës where we go.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Then spake Holly, and set him down on his 
 knee,</span><br><span class="i2">I pray thee, gentle Ivy,</span><br><span class="i2">Say me no villainy,</span><br><span class="i3">In landës where we 
 go.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-55">12-55</a><a name="Nanchor_12-55"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>The sanctity of Christmas house-decorations in England is shown by the care 
 taken in disposing of them when removed from the walls. In Shropshire 
 old-fashioned people never threw them away, for fear of misfortune, but either 
 burnt them or gave them to the cows; it was very unlucky to let a piece <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a> <a name="Page_276"></a>fall to the ground. The Shropshire custom was to leave the 
 holly and ivy up until Candlemas, while the mistletoe-bough was carefully 
 preserved until the time came for a new one next year. West Shropshire 
 tradition, by the way, connects the mistletoe with the New Year rather than with 
 Christmas; the bough ought not to be put up until New Year's Eve.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-56">12-56</a><a name="Nanchor_12-56"></a> </p>
 <p>In Sweden green boughs, apparently, are not used for decoration, but the 
 floor of the parlour is strewn with sprigs of fragrant juniper or spruce-pine, 
 or with rye-straw.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-57">12-57</a><a name="Nanchor_12-57"></a> The straw was probably intended originally to bring 
 to the house, by means of sacramental contact, the wholesome influences of the 
 corn-spirit, though the common people connect it with the stable at Bethlehem. 
 The practice of laying straw and the same Christian explanation are found also 
 in Poland﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-58">12-58</a><a name="Nanchor_12-58"></a> and in Crivoscia.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-59">12-59</a><a name="Nanchor_12-59"></a> In Poland before the cloth is laid on Christmas Eve, 
 the table is covered with a layer of hay or straw, and a sheaf stands in the 
 corner. Years ago straw was also spread on the floor. Sometimes it is given to 
 the cattle as a charm and sometimes it is used to tie up fruit-trees.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-60">12-60</a><a name="Nanchor_12-60"></a> </p>
 <p>Dr. Frazer conjectures that the Swedish Yule straw comes in part at least 
 from the last sheaf at harvest, to which, as embodying the corn-spirit, a 
 peculiar significance is attached. The Swedish, like the Polish, Yule straw has 
 sundry virtues; scattered on the ground it will make a barren field productive; 
 and it is used to bind trees and make them fruitful.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-61">12-61</a><a name="Nanchor_12-61"></a> Again the peasant at Christmas will sit on a log and 
 throw up Yule straws one by one to the roof; as many as lodge in the rafters, so 
 many will be the sheaves of rye at harvest.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-62">12-62</a><a name="Nanchor_12-62"></a> </p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Christmas and New Year Gifts.</span></h3>
 <p>We have come across presents of various kinds at the pre-Christmas festivals; 
 now that we have reached Christmastide itself we may dwell a little upon the 
 festival as the great present-giving season of the year, and try to get at the 
 origins of the custom.</p>
 <p>The Roman <i>strenae</i> offered to the Emperor or exchanged between private 
 citizens at the January Kalends have already <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a> <a name="Page_277"></a>been noted. According to tradition they were originally 
 merely branches plucked from the grove of the goddess Strenia, and the purpose 
 of these may well have been akin to that of the greenery used for decorations, 
 viz., to secure contact with a vegetation-spirit. In the time of the Empire, 
 however, the <i>strenae</i> were of a more attractive character, “men gave 
 honeyed things, that the year of the recipient might be full of sweetness, lamps 
 that it might be full of light, copper and silver and gold that wealth might 
 flow in amain.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-63">12-63</a><a name="Nanchor_12-63"></a> Such presents were obviously a kind of charm for the 
 New Year, based on the principle that as the beginning was, so would the rest of 
 the year be.</p>
 <p>With the adoption of the Roman New Year's Day its present-giving customs 
 appear to have spread far and wide. In France, where the Latin spirit is still 
 strong, January 1 is even now the great day for presents, and they are 
 actually called <i>étrennes</i>, a name obviously derived from <i>strenae</i>. 
 In Paris boxes of sweets are then given by bachelors to friends who have 
 entertained them at their houses during the year﻿—a survival perhaps of the 
 “honeyed things” given in Roman times.</p>
 <p>In many countries, however, present-giving is attached to the ecclesiastical 
 festival of Christmas. This is doubtless largely due to attraction from the 
 Roman New Year's Day to the feast hallowed by the Church, but readers of the 
 foregoing pages will have seen that Christmas has also drawn to itself many 
 practices of a November festival, and it is probable that German Christmas 
 presents, at least, are connected as much with the apples and nuts of St. Martin 
 and St. Nicholas﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_107">107</a><a name="FNanchor_107"></a> as with the Roman <i>strenae</i>. It has already 
 been pointed out that the German St. Nicholas as present-giver appears to be a 
 duplicate of St. Martin, and that St. Nicholas himself has often wandered from 
 his own day to Christmas, or has been replaced by the Christ Child. We have also 
 noted the rod associated with the two saints, and seen reason for thinking that 
 its original purpose was not disciplinary but health-giving.</p>
 <p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a> <a name="Page_278"></a>It is interesting to find that while, if we may trust 
 tradition, the Roman <i>strenae</i> were originally twigs, Christmas gifts in 
 sixteenth-century Germany showed a connection with the twigs or rods of St. 
 Martin and St. Nicholas. The presents were tied together in a bundle, and a twig 
 was added to them.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-65">12-65</a><a name="Nanchor_12-65"></a> This was regarded by the pedagogic mind of the 
 period not as a lucky twig but as a rod in the sinister sense. In some 
 Protestant sermons of the latter half of the century there are curious detailed 
 references to Christmas presents. These are supposed to be brought to children 
 by the Saviour Himself, strangely called the <i>Haus-Christ</i>. Among the gifts 
 mentioned as contained in the “Christ-bundles” are pleasant things like money, 
 sugar-plums, cakes, apples, nuts, dolls; useful things like clothes; and also 
 things “that belong to teaching, obedience, chastisement, and discipline, as 
 A.B.C. tablets, Bibles and handsome books, writing materials, paper, &amp;c., 
 <i>and the</i> <i>Christ-rod</i>.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-66">12-66</a><a name="Nanchor_12-66"></a> </p>
 <p>A common gift to German children at Christmas or the New Year was an apple 
 with a coin in it; the coin may conceivably be a Roman survival,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-67">12-67</a><a name="Nanchor_12-67"></a> while the apple may be connected with those brought 
 by St. Nicholas.</p>
 <p>The Christ Child is still supposed to bring presents in Germany; in France, 
 too, it is sometimes <i>le petit Jésus</i> who bears the welcome gifts.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-68">12-68</a><a name="Nanchor_12-68"></a> In Italy we shall find that the great time for 
 children's presents is Epiphany Eve, when the Befana comes, though in the 
 northern provinces Santa Lucia is sometimes a gift-bringer.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-69">12-69</a><a name="Nanchor_12-69"></a> In Sicily the days for gifts and the supposed 
 bringers vary; sometimes, as we have already seen, it is the dead who bring 
 them, on All Souls Eve; sometimes it is <i>la Vecchia di Natali</i>﻿—the 
 Christmas old woman﻿—who comes with them on Christmas Eve; sometimes they are 
 brought by the old woman Strina﻿—note the derivation from <i>strenae</i>﻿—at the 
 New Year; sometimes by the Befana at the Epiphany.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-70">12-70</a><a name="Nanchor_12-70"></a> </p>
 <p>A curious mode of giving presents on Christmas Eve belongs particularly to 
 Sweden, though it is also found﻿—perhaps borrowed﻿—in Mecklenburg, Pomerania, 
 and other parts of Germany. The so-called <i>Julklapp</i> is a gift wrapped up 
 in innumerable coverings. The person who brings it raps noisily at <a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a> <a name="Page_279"></a>the door, and throws or pushes the <i>Julklapp</i> into the 
 room. It is essential that he should arrive quite unexpectedly, and come and go 
 like lightning without revealing his identity. Great efforts are made to conceal 
 the gift so that the recipient after much trouble in undoing the covering may 
 have to search and search again to find it. Sometimes in Sweden a thin gold ring 
 is hidden away in a great heavy box, or a little gold heart is put in a 
 Christmas cake. Occasionally a man contrives to hide in the <i>Julklapp</i> and 
 thus offer himself as a Christmas present to the lady whom he loves. The gift is 
 often accompanied by some satirical rhyme, or takes a form intended to tease the 
 recipient.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-71">12-71</a><a name="Nanchor_12-71"></a> </p>
 <p>Another custom, sometimes found in “better-class” Swedish households, is for 
 the Christmas presents to be given by two masked figures, an old man and an old 
 woman. The old man holds a bell in his hand and rings it, the old woman carries 
 a basket full of sealed packets, which she delivers to the addressees.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-72">12-72</a><a name="Nanchor_12-72"></a> </p>
 <p>There is nothing specially interesting in modern English modes of 
 present-giving. We may, however, perhaps see in the custom of Christmas boxes, 
 inexorably demanded and not always willingly bestowed, a degeneration of what 
 was once friendly entertainment given in return for the good wishes and the luck 
 brought by wassailers. Instances of gifts to calling neighbours have already 
 come before our notice at several pre-Christmas festivals, notably All Souls, 
 St. Clement's, and St. Thomas's. As for the name “Christmas box,” it would seem 
 to have come from the receptacles used for the gifts. According to one account 
 apprentices, journeymen, and servants used to carry about earthen boxes with a 
 slit in them, and when the time for collecting was over, broke them to obtain 
 the contents.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-73">12-73</a><a name="Nanchor_12-73"></a> </p>
 <p>The Christmas card, a sort of attenuated present, seems to be of quite modern 
 origin. It is apparently a descendant of the “school pieces” or “Christmas 
 pieces” popular in England in the first half of the nineteenth century﻿—sheets 
 of writing-paper with designs in pen and ink or copper-plate headings. The first 
 Christmas card proper appears to have been issued in 1846, but it was not till 
 about 1862 that the custom of card-sending obtained any foothold.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-74">12-74</a><a name="Nanchor_12-74"></a> </p>
