 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">All Saints and All Souls Days.</span></h3>
 <p>In the reign of Charles I. the young gentlemen of the Middle Temple were 
 accustomed to reckon All Hallow Tide (November 1) the beginning of 
 Christmas.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-1">8-1</a><a name="Nanchor_8-1"></a> We may here do likewise and start our survey of winter 
 festivals with November, in the earlier half of which, apparently, fell the 
 Celtic and Teutonic New Year's Days. It is impossible to fix precise dates, but 
 there is reason for thinking that the Celtic year began about 
 November 1,﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_86">86</a><a name="FNanchor_86"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-2">8-2</a><a name="Nanchor_8-2"></a> and the Teutonic about November 11.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-3">8-3</a><a name="Nanchor_8-3"></a> </p>
 <p>On November 1 falls one of the greater festivals of the western Church, 
 All Saints﻿—or, to give it its old English name, All Hallows﻿—and on the 
 morrow is the solemn commemoration of the departed﻿—All Souls. In these two 
 anniversaries the Church has <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a> <a name="Page_190"></a>preserved at or near the original date one part of the old 
 beginning-of-winter festival﻿—the part concerned with the cult of the dead. Some 
 of the practices belonging to this side of the feast have been transferred to 
 the season of Christmas and the Twelve Days, but these have often lost their 
 original meaning, and it is to All Souls Day that we must look for the most 
 conscious survivals of that care for the departed which is so marked a feature 
 of primitive religion. Early November, when the leaves are falling, and all 
 around speaks of mortality, is a fitting time for the commemoration of the 
 dead.</p>
 <p>The first clear testimony to All Souls Day is found at the end of the tenth 
 century, and in France. All Saints Day, however, was certainly observed in 
 England, France, and Germany in the eighth century,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-5">8-5</a><a name="Nanchor_8-5"></a> and probably represents an attempt on the part of the 
 Church to turn the minds of the faithful away from the pagan belief in and 
 tendance of “ghosts” to the contemplation of the saints in the glory of 
 Paradise. It would seem that this attempt failed, that the people needed a way 
 of actually doing something for their own dead, and that All Souls Day with its 
 solemn Mass and prayers for the departed was intended to supply this need and 
 replace the traditional practices.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-6">8-6</a><a name="Nanchor_8-6"></a> Here again the attempt was only partly successful, for 
 side by side with the Church's rites there survived a number of usages related 
 not to any Christian doctrine of the after-life, but to the pagan idea, 
 widespread among many peoples, that on one day or night of the year the souls of 
 the dead return to their old homes and must be entertained.</p>
 <p>All Souls Day then appeals to instincts older than Christianity. How strong 
 is the hold of ancient custom even upon the sceptical and irreligious is shown 
 very strikingly in Roman Catholic countries: even those who never go to church 
 visit the graves of their relations on All Souls Eve to deck them with 
 flowers.</p>
 <p>The special liturgical features of the Church's celebration are the Vespers, 
 Matins, and Lauds of the Dead on the evening of November 1, and the solemn 
 Requiem Mass on November 2, with the majestic “Dies irae” and the 
 oft-recurrent versicle, “Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua 
 luceat <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a> <a name="Page_191"></a>eis,” that most beautiful of prayers. The priest and altar 
 are vested in black, and a catafalque with burning tapers round it stands in the 
 body of the church. For the popular customs on the Eve we may quote Dr. Tylor's 
 general description:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“In Italy the day is given to feasting and drinking in honour of the dead, 
   while skulls and skeletons in sugar and paste form appropriate children's 
   toys. In Tyrol, the poor souls released from purgatory fire for the night may 
   come and smear their burns with the melted fat of the soul light on the 
   hearth, or cakes are left for them on the table, and the room is kept warm for 
   their comfort. Even in Paris the souls of the departed come to partake of the 
   food of the living. In Brittany the crowd pours into the churchyard at 
   evening, to kneel barefoot at the grave of dead kinsfolk, to fill the hollow 
   of the tombstone with holy water, or to pour libations of milk upon it. All 
   night the church bells clang, and sometimes a solemn procession of the clergy 
   goes round to bless the graves. In no household that night is the cloth 
   removed, for the supper must be left for the souls to come and take their 
   part, nor must the fire be put out, where they will come to warm themselves. 
   And at last, as the inmates retire to rest, there is heard at the door a 
   doleful chant﻿—it is the souls, who, borrowing the voices of the parish poor, 
   have come to ask the prayers of the living.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-7">8-7</a><a name="Nanchor_8-7"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>To this may be added some further accounts of All Souls Eve as the one night 
 in the year when the spirits of the departed are thought to revisit their old 
 homes.</p>
 <p>In the Vosges mountains while the bells are ringing in All Souls Eve it is a 
 custom to uncover the beds and open the windows in order that the poor souls may 
 enter and rest. Prayer is made for the dead until late in the night, and when 
 the last “De profundis” has been said “the head of the family gently covers up 
 the beds, sprinkles them with holy water, and shuts the windows.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-8">8-8</a><a name="Nanchor_8-8"></a> </p>
 <p>The Esthonians on All Souls Day provide a meal for the dead and invite them 
 by name. The souls arrive at the first cock-crow and depart at the second, being 
 lighted out of the house by the head of the family, who waves a white cloth 
 after them and bids them come again next year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-9">8-9</a><a name="Nanchor_8-9"></a> </p>
 <p>In Brittany, as we have seen, the dead are thought to return at <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a> <a name="Page_192"></a>this season. It is believed that on the night between All 
 Saints and All Souls the church is lighted up and the departed attend a 
 nocturnal Mass celebrated by a phantom priest. All through the week, in one 
 district, people are afraid to go out after nightfall lest they should see some 
 dead person.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-10">8-10</a><a name="Nanchor_8-10"></a> In Tyrol it is believed that the “poor souls” are 
 present in the howling winds that often blow at this time.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-11">8-11</a><a name="Nanchor_8-11"></a> </p>
 <p>In the Abruzzi on All Souls Eve “before people go to sleep they place on the 
 table a lighted lamp or candle and a frugal meal of bread and water. The dead 
 issue from their graves and stalk in procession through every street of the 
 village.... First pass the souls of the good, and then the souls of the murdered 
 and the damned.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-12">8-12</a><a name="Nanchor_8-12"></a> </p>
 <p>In Sicily a strange belief is connected with All Souls Day (<i>jornu di li 
 morti</i>): the family dead are supposed, like Santa Klaus in the North, to 
 bring presents to children; the dead relations have become the good fairies of 
 the little ones. On the night between November 1 and 2 little Sicilians 
 believe that the departed leave their dread abode and come to town to steal from 
 rich shopkeepers sweets and toys and new clothes. These they give to their child 
 relations who have been “good” and have prayed on their behalf. Often they are 
 clothed in white and wear silken shoes, to elude the vigilance of the 
 shopkeepers. They do not always enter the houses; sometimes the presents are 
 left in the children's shoes put outside doors and windows. In the morning the 
 pretty gifts are attributed by the children to the <i>morti</i> in whose coming 
 their parents have taught them to believe.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-13">8-13</a><a name="Nanchor_8-13"></a> </p>
 <p>A very widespread custom at this season is to burn candles, perhaps in order 
 to lighten the darkness for the poor souls. In Catholic Ireland candles shine in 
 the windows on the Vigil of All Souls,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-14">8-14</a><a name="Nanchor_8-14"></a> in Belgium a holy candle is burnt all night, or 
 people walk in procession with lighted tapers, while in many Roman Catholic 
 countries, and even in the Protestant villages of Baden, the graves are decked 
 with lights as well as flowers.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-15">8-15</a><a name="Nanchor_8-15"></a> </p>
 <p>Another practice on All Saints and All Souls Days, curiously <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a> <a name="Page_193"></a>common formerly in Protestant England, is that of making 
 and giving “soul-cakes.” These and the quest of them by children were customary 
 in various English counties and in Scotland.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-16">8-16</a><a name="Nanchor_8-16"></a> The youngsters would beg not only for the cakes but 
 also sometimes for such things as “apples and strong beer,” presumably to make a 
 “wassail-bowl” of “lambswool,” hot spiced ale with roast apples in it.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-17">8-17</a><a name="Nanchor_8-17"></a> Here is a curious rhyme which they sang in Shropshire 
 as they went round to their neighbours, collecting contributions:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Soul! soul! for a soul-cake!</span><br><span class="i2">I pray, good missis, a soul-cake!</span><br><span class="i2">An apple or 
 pear, a plum or a cherry,</span><br><span class="i2">Any good thing to make us 
 merry.</span><br><span class="i2">One for Peter, two for Paul,</span><br><span class="i2">Three for Him who made us all.</span><br><span class="i2">Up with the 
 kettle, and down with the pan,</span><br><span class="i2">Give us good alms, and 
 we'll be gone.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-18">8-18</a><a name="Nanchor_8-18"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Shropshire is a county peculiarly rich in “souling” traditions, and one old 
 lady had cakes made to give away to the souling-children up to the time of her 
 death in 1884. At that period the custom of “souling” had greatly declined in 
 the county, and where it still existed the rewards were usually apples or money. 
 Grown men, as well as children, sometimes went round, and the ditties sung often 
 contained verses of good-wishes for the household practically identical with 
 those sung by wassailers at Christmas.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-19">8-19</a><a name="Nanchor_8-19"></a> </p>
 <p>The name “soul-cake” of course suggests that the cakes were in some way 
 associated with the departed, whether given as a reward for prayers for souls in 
 Purgatory, or as a charity for the benefit of the “poor souls,” or baked that 
 the dead might feast upon them.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_87">87</a><a name="FNanchor_87"></a> It seems most probable that they were relics of a 
 feast once laid out for the souls. On the other hand it is just possible that 
 they were originally a sacrament of the corn-spirit. <a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a> <a name="Page_194"></a>A North Welsh tradition recorded by Pennant may conceivably 
 have preserved a vague memory of some agricultural connection: he tells us that 
 on receiving soul-cakes the poor people used to pray to God to bless the next 
 crop of wheat.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-20">8-20</a><a name="Nanchor_8-20"></a> </p>
 <p>Not in Great Britain alone are soul-cakes found; they are met with in 
 Belgium, southern Germany, and Austria. In western Flanders children set up on 
 All Souls Eve little street altars, putting a crucifix or Madonna with candles 
 on a chair or stool, and begging passers-by for money “for cakes for the souls 
 in Purgatory.” On All Souls morning it is customary, all over the Flemish part 
 of Belgium, to bake little cakes of finest white flour, called “soul-bread.” 
 They are eaten hot, and a prayer is said at the same time for the souls in 
 Purgatory. It is believed that a soul is delivered for every cake eaten. At 
 Antwerp the cakes are coloured yellow with saffron to suggest the Purgatorial 
 flames. In southern Germany and Austria little white loaves of a special kind 
 are baked; they are generally oval in form, and are usually called by some name 
 into which the word “soul” enters. In Tyrol they are given to children by their 
 godparents; those for the boys have the shape of horses or hares, those for the 
 girls, of hens. In Tyrol the cakes left over at supper remain on the table and 
 are said to “belong to the poor souls.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-21">8-21</a><a name="Nanchor_8-21"></a> </p>
 <p>In Friuli in the north-east of Italy there is a custom closely corresponding 
 to our “soul-cakes.” On All Souls Day every family gives away a quantity of 
 bread. This is not regarded as a charity; all the people of the village come to 
 receive it and before eating it pray for the departed of the donor's family. The 
 most prosperous people are not ashamed to knock at the door and ask for this 
 <i>pane dei morti</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-22">8-22</a><a name="Nanchor_8-22"></a> </p>
 <p>In Tyrol All Souls is a day of licensed begging, which has become a serious 
 abuse. A noisy rabble of ragged and disorderly folk, with bags and baskets to 
 receive gifts, wanders from village to village, claiming as a right the presents 
 of provisions that were originally a freewill offering for the benefit of the 
 departed, and angrily abusing those who refuse to give.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-23">8-23</a><a name="Nanchor_8-23"></a> </p>
 <p>The New Year is the time for a festival of the dead in many parts of the 
 world.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-24">8-24</a><a name="Nanchor_8-24"></a> I may quote Dr. Frazer's account of what <a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a> <a name="Page_195"></a>goes on in Tonquin; it shows a remarkable likeness to some 
 European customs﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_88">88</a><a name="FNanchor_88"></a>:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“In Tonquin, as in Sumba, the dead revisit their kinsfolk and their old 
   homes at the New Year. From the hour of midnight, when the New Year begins, no 
   one dares to shut the door of his house for fear of excluding the ghosts, who 
   begin to arrive at that time. Preparations have been made to welcome and 
   refresh them after their long journey. Beds and mats are ready for their weary 
   bodies to repose upon, water to wash their dusty feet, slippers to comfort 
   them, and canes to support their feeble steps.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-25">8-25</a><a name="Nanchor_8-25"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>In Lithuania, the last country in Europe to be converted to Christianity, 
 heathen traditions lingered long, and sixteenth- and seventeenth-century 
 travellers give accounts of a pagan New Year's feast which has great interest. 
 In October, according to one account, on November 2, according to another, 
 the whole family met together, strewed the tables with straw and put sacks on 
 the straw. Bread and two jugs of beer were then placed on the table, and one of 
 every kind of domestic animal was roasted before the fire after a prayer to the 
 god Zimiennik (possibly an ancestral spirit), asking for protection through the 
 year and offering the animals. Portions were thrown to the corners of the room 
 with the words “Accept our burnt sacrifice, O Zimiennik, and kindly partake 
 thereof.” Then followed a great feast. Further, the spirits of the dead were 
 invited to leave their graves and visit the bath-house, where platters of food 
 were spread out and left for three days. At the end of this time the remains of 
 the repast were set out over the graves and libations poured.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-26">8-26</a><a name="Nanchor_8-26"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">The beginning of November is not solely a time of memory 
 of the dead; customs of other sorts linger, or until lately used to linger, 
 about it, especially in Scotland, northern England, Ireland, Cornwall, Wales, 
 and the West Midlands. One may conjecture that these are survivals from the 
 Celtic New Year's Day, for most of them are of the nature of omens or charms. 
 Apples and nuts are prominent on Hallowe'en, the Eve of All <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a> <a name="Page_196"></a>Saints;﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_89">89</a><a name="FNanchor_89"></a> they may be regarded either as a kind of sacrament of 
 the vegetation-spirit, or as simply intended by homoeopathic magic to bring 
 fulness and fruitfulness to their recipients. A custom once common in the north 
 of England﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-27">8-27</a><a name="Nanchor_8-27"></a> and in Wales﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-28">8-28</a><a name="Nanchor_8-28"></a> was to catch at apples with the mouth, the fruit 
 being suspended on a string, or on one end of a large transverse beam with a 
 lighted candle at the other end. In the north apples and nuts were the feature 
 of the evening feast, hence the name “Nutcrack night.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-29">8-29</a><a name="Nanchor_8-29"></a> </p>
 <p>Again, at St. Ives in Cornwall every child is given a big apple on 
 Allhallows Eve﻿—“Allan Day” as it is called.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-30">8-30</a><a name="Nanchor_8-30"></a> Nuts and apples were also used as means of 
 forecasting the future. In Scotland for instance nuts were put into the fire and 
 named after particular lads and lasses. “As they burn quietly together or start 
 from beside one another, the course and issue of the courtship will be.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-31">8-31</a><a name="Nanchor_8-31"></a> On Hallowe'en in Nottinghamshire if a girl had two 
 lovers and wanted to know which would be the more constant, she took two 
 apple-pips, stuck one on each cheek (naming them after her lovers) and waited 
 for one to fall off. The poet Gay alludes to this custom:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“See from the core two kernels now I 
 take,</span><br><span class="i2">This on my cheek for Lubberkin is 
 worn,</span><br><span class="i2">And Booby Clod on t'other side is 
 borne;</span><br><span class="i2">But Booby Clod soon falls upon the 
 ground,</span><br><span class="i2">A certain token that his love's 
 unsound;</span><br><span class="i2">While Lubberkin sticks firmly to the 
 last;</span><br><span class="i2">Oh! were his lips to mine but joined so fast.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-32">8-32</a><a name="Nanchor_8-32"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>In Nottinghamshire apples are roasted and the parings thrown over the left 
 shoulder. “Notice is taken of the shapes which the parings assume when they fall 
 to the ground. Whatever letter a paring resembles will be the initial letter of 
 the Christian name of the man or woman whom you will marry.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-33">8-33</a><a name="Nanchor_8-33"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a> <a name="Page_197"></a>Hallowe'en is indeed in the British Isles the favourite 
 time for forecasting the future, and various methods are employed for this 
 purpose.</p>
 <p>A girl may cross her shoes upon her bedroom floor in the shape of a T and say 
 these lines:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“I cross my shoes in the shape of a 
 T,</span><br><span class="i2">Hoping this night my true love to 
 see,</span><br><span class="i2">Not in his best or worst array,</span><br><span class="i2">But in the clothes of every day.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>Then let her get into bed backwards without speaking any more that night, and 
 she will see her future husband in her dreams.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-34">8-34</a><a name="Nanchor_8-34"></a> </p>
 <p>“On All Hallowe'en or New Year's Eve,” says Mr. W. Henderson, “a Border 
 maiden may wash her sark, and hang it over a chair to dry, taking care to tell 
 no one what she is about. If she lie awake long enough, she will see the form of 
 her future spouse enter the room and turn the sark. We are told of one young 
 girl who, after fulfilling this rite, looked out of bed and saw a coffin behind 
 the sark; it remained visible for some time and then disappeared. The girl rose 
 up in agony and told her family what had occurred, and the next morning she 
 heard of her lover's death.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-35">8-35</a><a name="Nanchor_8-35"></a> </p>
 <p>In Scotland﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-36">8-36</a><a name="Nanchor_8-36"></a> and Ireland﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-37">8-37</a><a name="Nanchor_8-37"></a> other methods of foreseeing the future are practised 
 on Hallowe'en; we need not consider them here, for we shall have quite enough of 
 such auguries later on. (Some Scottish customs are introduced by Burns into his 
 poem “Hallowe'en.”) I may, however, allude to the custom formerly prevalent in 
 Wales for women to congregate in the church on this “Night of the Winter 
 Kalends,” in order to discover who of the parishioners would die during the 
 year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-38">8-38</a><a name="Nanchor_8-38"></a> East of the Welsh border, at Dorstone in 
 Herefordshire, there was a belief that on All Hallows Eve at midnight those who 
 were bold enough to look through the windows would see the church lighted with 
 an unearthly glow, and Satan in monk's habit fulminating anathemas from the 
 pulpit and calling out the names of those who were to render up their souls.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-39">8-39</a><a name="Nanchor_8-39"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a> <a name="Page_198"></a>Again, there are numerous Hallowe'en fire customs, probably 
 sun-charms for the New Year, a kind of homoeopathic magic intended to assist the 
 sun in his struggle with the powers of darkness. To this day great bonfires are 
 kindled in the Highlands, and formerly brands were carried about and the new 
 fire was lit in each house.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-40">8-40</a><a name="Nanchor_8-40"></a> It would seem that the Yule log customs (see  <a href="crt14.htm#Chapter_X">X</a>) are connected with this new lighting of the house-fire, transferred to 
 Christmas.</p>
 <p>In Ireland fire was lighted at this time at a place called Tlachtga, from 
 which all the hearths in Ireland are said to have been annually supplied.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-41">8-41</a><a name="Nanchor_8-41"></a> In Wales the habit of lighting bonfires on the hills 
 is perhaps not yet extinct.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-42">8-42</a><a name="Nanchor_8-42"></a> Within living memory when the flames were out 
 somebody would raise the cry, “May the tailless black sow seize the hindmost,” 
 and everyone present would run for his life.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-43">8-43</a><a name="Nanchor_8-43"></a> This may point to a former human sacrifice, possibly 
 of a victim laden with the accumulated evils of the past year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-44">8-44</a><a name="Nanchor_8-44"></a> </p>
 <p>In North Wales, according to another account, each family used to make a 
 great bonfire in a conspicuous place near the house. Every person threw into the 
 ashes a white stone, marked; the stones were searched for in the morning, and if 
 any one were missing the person who had thrown it in would die, it was believed, 
 during the year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-45">8-45</a><a name="Nanchor_8-45"></a> The same belief and practice were found at Callander 
 in Perthshire.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-46">8-46</a><a name="Nanchor_8-46"></a> </p>
 <p>Though, probably, the Hallowe'en fire rites had originally some connection 
 with the sun, the conscious intention of those who practised them in modern 
 times was often to ward off witchcraft. With this object in one place the master 
 of the family used to carry a bunch of burning straw about the corn, in Scotland 
 the red end of a fiery stick was waved in the air, in Lancashire a lighted 
 candle was borne about the fells, and in the Isle of Man fires were kindled.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-47">8-47</a><a name="Nanchor_8-47"></a> </p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Guy Fawkes Day.</span></h3>
 <p>Probably the burning of Guy Fawkes on November 5 is a survival of a New 
 Year bonfire. There is every reason to think that the commemoration of the 
 deliverance from “gunpowder <a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a> <a name="Page_199"></a>treason and plot” is but a modern meaning attached to an 
 ancient traditional practice, for the burning of the effigy has many parallels 
 in folk-custom. Dr. Frazer﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-48">8-48</a><a name="Nanchor_8-48"></a> regards such effigies as representatives of the 
 spirit of vegetation﻿—by burning them in a fire that represented the sun men 
 thought they secured sunshine for trees and crops. Later, when the ideas on 
 which the custom was based had faded away, people came to identify these images 
 with persons whom they regarded with aversion, such as Judas Iscariot, Luther 
 (in Catholic Tyrol), and, apparently, Guy Fawkes in England. At Ludlow in 
 Shropshire, it is interesting to note, if any well-known local man had aroused 
 the enmity of the populace his effigy was substituted for, or added to, that of 
 Guy Fawkes. Bonfire Day at Ludlow is marked by a torchlight procession and a 
 huge conflagration.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-49">8-49</a><a name="Nanchor_8-49"></a> At Hampstead the Guy Fawkes fire and procession are 
 still in great force. The thing has become a regular carnival, and on a foggy 
 November night the procession along the steep curving Heath Street, with the 
 glare of the torches lighting up the faces of dense crowds, is a strangely 
 picturesque spectacle.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_90">90</a><a name="FNanchor_90"></a></p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Animal Masks.</span></h3>
 <p>On All Souls Day in Cheshire there began to be carried about a curious 
 construction called “Old Hob,” a horse's head enveloped in a sheet; it was taken 
 from door to door, and accompanied by the singing of begging rhymes.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-50">8-50</a><a name="Nanchor_8-50"></a> Old Hob, who continued to appear until Christmas, is 
 an English parallel to the German <i>Schimmel</i> or white horse. We have here 
 to do with one of those strange animal forms which are apparently relics of 
 sacrificial customs. They come on various days in the winter festival season, 
 and also at other times, and may as well be considered at this point. In some 
 cases they are definitely imitations of animals, and may have replaced real 
 sacrificial beasts taken about in procession, in others they are simply men 
 wearing the head, horn, hide, or tail of a beast, like the worshippers at many 
 <a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a> <a name="Page_200"></a>a heathen sacrifice to-day. (Of the <i>rationale</i> of 
 masking something has already been said in  <a href="crt10.htm#Chapter_VI">VI</a>)</p>
 <p>The mingling of Roman and non-Roman customs makes it very hard to separate 
 the different elements in the winter festivals. In regard particularly to animal 
 masks it is difficult to pronounce in favour of one racial origin rather than 
 another; we may, however, infer with some probability that when a custom is 
 attached not to Christmas or the January Kalends but to one of the November or 
 early December feasts, it is not of Roman origin. For, as the centuries have 
 passed, Christmas and the Kalends﻿—the Roman festivals ecclesiastical and 
 secular﻿—have increasingly tended to supplant the old northern festal times, and 
 a transference of, for instance, a Teutonic custom from Martinmas to Christmas 
 or January 1, is far more conceivable than the attraction of a Roman 
 practice to one of the earlier and waning festivals.</p>
 <p>Let us take first the horse-forms, seemingly connected with that sacrificial 
 use of the horse among the Teutons to which Tacitus and other writers 
 testify.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-51">8-51</a><a name="Nanchor_8-51"></a> “Old Hob” is doubtless one form of the hobby horse, 
 so familiar in old English festival customs. His German parallel, the 
 <i>Schimmel</i>, is mostly formed thus in the north: a sieve with a long pole to 
 whose end a horse's head is fastened, is tied beneath the chest of a young man, 
 who goes on all fours, and some white cloths are thrown over the whole. In 
 Silesia the <i>Schimmel</i> is formed by three or four youths. The rider is 
 generally veiled, and often wears on his head a pot with glowing coals shining 
 forth through openings that represent eyes and a mouth.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-52">8-52</a><a name="Nanchor_8-52"></a> In Pomerania the thing is called simply 
 <i>Schimmel</i>,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-53">8-53</a><a name="Nanchor_8-53"></a> in other parts emphasis is laid upon the rider, and 
 the name <i>Schimmelreiter</i> is given. Some mythologists have seen in this 
 rider on a white horse an impersonation of Woden on his great charger; but it is 
 more likely that the practice simply originated in the taking round of a real 
 sacrificial horse.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-54">8-54</a><a name="Nanchor_8-54"></a> The <i>Schimmelreiter</i> is often accompanied by a 
 “bear,” a youth dressed in straw who plays the part of a bear tied to a pole.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-55">8-55</a><a name="Nanchor_8-55"></a> He may be connected with some such veneration of the 
 animal as is suggested by the custom still surviving at Berne, of keeping bears 
 at the public expense.</p>
 <p>To return to Great Britain, here is an account of a so-called <a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 201</font></a> <a name="Page_201"></a>“hodening” ceremony once performed at Christmas-time at 
 Ramsgate: “A party of young people procure the head of a dead horse, which is 
 affixed to a pole about four feet in length, a string is tied to the lower jaw, 
 a horse-cloth is then attached to the whole, under which one of the party gets, 
 and by frequently pulling the string keeps up a loud snapping noise and is 
 accompanied by the rest of the party grotesquely habited and ringing hand-bells. 
 They thus proceed from house to house, sounding their bells and singing carols 
 and songs.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-56">8-56</a><a name="Nanchor_8-56"></a> </p>
 <p>Again, in Wales a creature called “the Mari Llwyd” was known at Christmas. A 
 horse's skull is “dressed up with ribbons, and supported on a pole by a man who 
 is concealed under a large white cloth. There is a contrivance for opening and 
 shutting the jaws, and the figure pursues and bites everybody it can lay hold 
 of, and does not release them except on payment of a fine.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-57">8-57</a><a name="Nanchor_8-57"></a> The movable jaws here give the thing a likeness to 
 certain Continental figures representing other kinds of animals and probably 
 witnessing to their former sacrificial use. On the island of Usedom appears the 
 <i>Klapperbock</i>, a youth who carries a pole with the hide of a buck thrown 
 over it and a wooden head at the end. The lower jaw moves up and down and 
 clatters, and he charges at children who do not know their prayers by heart.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-58">8-58</a><a name="Nanchor_8-58"></a> In Upper Styria we meet the <i>Habergaiss</i>. Four 
 men hold on to one another and are covered with white blankets. The foremost one 
 holds up a wooden goat's head with a movable lower jaw that rattles, and he 
 butts children.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-59">8-59</a><a name="Nanchor_8-59"></a> At Ilsenburg in the Harz is found the 
 <i>Habersack</i>, formed by a person taking a pole ending in a fork, and putting 
 a broom between the prongs so that the appearance of a head with horns is 
 obtained. The carrier is concealed by a sheet.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-60">8-60</a><a name="Nanchor_8-60"></a> </p>
 <p>In connection with horns we must not forget the “horn-dance” at Abbots 
 Bromley in Staffordshire, held now in September, but formerly at Christmas. Six 
 of the performers wear sets of horns kept from year to year in the church.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-61">8-61</a><a name="Nanchor_8-61"></a> Plot, in his “Natural History of Staffordshire” 
 (1686, p. 434) calls it a “<i>Hobby-horse Dance</i> from a person who carried 
 the image of a horse between his legs, made of thin boards.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-62">8-62</a><a name="Nanchor_8-62"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a> <a name="Page_202"></a>In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway creatures resembling both 
 the <i>Schimmelreiter</i> and the <i>Klapperbock</i> are or were to be met with 
 at Christmas. The name <i>Julebuk</i> (yule buck) is used for various objects: 
 sometimes for a person dressed up in hide and horns, or with a buck's head, who 
 “goes for” little boys and girls; sometimes for a straw puppet set up or tossed 
 about from hand to hand; sometimes for a cake in the form of a buck. People seem 
 to have had a bad conscience about these things, for there are stories 
 connecting them with the Devil. A girl, for instance, who danced at midnight 
 with a straw <i>Julebuk</i>, found that her partner was no puppet but the Evil 
 One himself. Again, a fellow who had dressed himself in black and put horns on 
 his head, claws on his hands, and fiery tow in his mouth, was carried off by the 
 Prince of Darkness whose form he had mimicked.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-63">8-63</a><a name="Nanchor_8-63"></a> The association of animal maskings with the infernal 
 powers is doubtless the work of the Church. To the zealous missionary the old 
 heathen ritual was no mere foolish superstition but a service of intensely real 
 and awful beings, the very devils of hell, and one may even conjecture that the 
 traditional Christian devil-type, half animal half human, was indirectly derived 
 from skin-clad worshippers at pagan festivals.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Martinmas.</span></h3>
 <p>Between All Souls Day and Martinmas (November 11) there are no 
 folk-festivals of great importance, though on St. Hubert's Day, November 3, 
 in Flemish Belgium special little cakes are made, adorned with the horn of the 
 saint, the patron of hunting, and are eaten not only by human beings but by 
 dogs, cats, and other domestic animals.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-64">8-64</a><a name="Nanchor_8-64"></a> The English Guy Fawkes Day has already been 
 considered, while November 9, Lord Mayor's Day, the beginning of the 
 municipal year, may remind us of the old Teutonic New Year.</p>
 <p>Round Martinmas popular customs cluster thickly, as might be expected, since 
 it marks as nearly as possible the date of the old beginning-of-winter festival, 
 the feast perhaps at which Germanicus surprised the Marsi in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 14.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-65">8-65</a><a name="Nanchor_8-65"></a> </p>
 <p>The most obvious feature of Martinmas is its physical feasting. <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 203</font></a> <a name="Page_203"></a>Economic causes, as we saw in  <a href="crt10.htm#Chapter_VI">VI</a>, must have made the middle of November a great killing season among the 
 old Germans, for the snow which then began rendered it impossible longer to 
 pasture the beasts, and there was not fodder enough to keep the whole herd 
 through the winter. Thus it was a time of feasting on flesh, and of animal 
 sacrifices, as is suggested by the Anglo-Saxon name given to November by Bede, 
 <i>Blot-monath</i>, sacrifice-month.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-66">8-66</a><a name="Nanchor_8-66"></a> </p>
 <p>Christmas does not seem to have quickly superseded the middle of November as 
 a popular feast in Teutonic countries; rather one finds an outcome of the 
 conciliatory policy pursued by Gregory the Great (see  <a href="crt10.htm#Chapter_VI">VI</a>) in the development of Martinmas. Founded in the fifth century, it was 
 made a great Church festival by Pope Martin I. (649-654),﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-67">8-67</a><a name="Nanchor_8-67"></a> and it may well have been intended to absorb and 
 Christianize the New Year festivities of the Teutonic peoples. The veneration of 
 St. Martin spread rapidly in the churches of northern Europe, and he came to be 
 regarded as one of the very chief of the saints.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-68">8-68</a><a name="Nanchor_8-68"></a> His day is no longer a Church feast of high rank, but 
 its importance as a folk festival is great.</p>
 <p>The tradition of slaughter is preserved in the British custom of killing 
 cattle on St. Martin's Day﻿—“Martlemas beef”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-69">8-69</a><a name="Nanchor_8-69"></a> ﻿—and in the German eating of St. Martin's geese and 
 swine.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-70">8-70</a><a name="Nanchor_8-70"></a> The St. Martin's goose, indeed, is in Germany as much 
 a feature of the festival as the English Michaelmas goose is of the September 
 feast of the angels.</p>
 <p>In Denmark too a goose is eaten at Martinmas, and from its breast-bone the 
 character of the coming winter can be foreseen. The white in it is a sign of 
 snow, the brown of very great cold. Similar ideas can be traced in Germany, 
 though there is not always agreement as to what the white and the brown 
 betoken.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-71">8-71</a><a name="Nanchor_8-71"></a> </p>
 <p>At St. Peter's, Athlone, Ireland, a very obviously sacrificial custom lasted 
 on into the nineteenth century. Every household would kill an animal of some 
 kind, and sprinkle the threshold with its blood. A cow or sheep, a goose or 
 turkey, or merely a cock or hen, was used according to the means of the 
 family.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-72">8-72</a><a name="Nanchor_8-72"></a> It seems that the animal was actually offered to St. 
 Martin, apparently as <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 204</font></a> <a name="Page_204"></a>the successor of some god, and bad luck came if the custom 
 were not observed. Probably these rites were transferred to Martinmas from the 
 old Celtic festival of <i>Samhain</i>. Again, in a strange Irish legend the 
 saint himself is said to have been cut up and eaten in the form of an ox.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-73">8-73</a><a name="Nanchor_8-73"></a> </p>
 <p>In the wine-producing regions of Germany Martinmas was the day for the first 
 drinking of the new wine, and the feasting in general on his day gave the saint 
 the reputation of a guzzler and a glutton; it even became customary to speak of 
 a person who had squandered his substance in riotous living as a 
 <i>Martinsmann</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-74">8-74</a><a name="Nanchor_8-74"></a> As we have seen survivals of sacrifice in the 
 Martinmas slaughter, so we may regard the <i>Martinsminne</i> or toast as 
 originating in a sacrifice of liquor.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-75">8-75</a><a name="Nanchor_8-75"></a> In the Böhmerwald it is believed that wine taken at 
 Martinmas brings strength and beauty, and the lads and girls gather in the inns 
 to drink, while a common German proverb runs:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Heb an Martini,</span><br><span class="i2">Trink Wein per circulum anni.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_91">91</a><a name="FNanchor_91"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-76">8-76</a><a name="Nanchor_8-76"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Here, by the way, is a faint suggestion that Martinmas is regarded as the 
 beginning of the year; as such it certainly appears in a number of legal 
 customs, English, French, and German, which existed in the Middle Ages and in 
 some cases in quite recent times. It was often at Martinmas that leases ended, 
 rents had to be paid, and farm-servants changed their places.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-77">8-77</a><a name="Nanchor_8-77"></a> </p>
 <p>There is a survival, perhaps, of a cereal sacrifice or sacrament in the 
 so-called “Martin's horns,” horseshoe pastries given at Martinmas in many parts 
 of Germany.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-78">8-78</a><a name="Nanchor_8-78"></a> Another kind of sacrifice is suggested by a Dutch 
 custom of throwing baskets of fruit into Martinmas bonfires, and by a German 
 custom of casting in empty fruit-baskets.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-79">8-79</a><a name="Nanchor_8-79"></a> In Venetia the peasants keep over from the vintage a 
 few grapes to form part of their Martinmas supper, and as far south as Sicily it 
 is considered essential to taste the new wine at this festival.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-80">8-80</a><a name="Nanchor_8-80"></a> </p>
 <p>Bonfires appear at Martinmas in Germany, as at All Hallows tide in the 
 British Isles. On St. Martin's Eve in the Rhine <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a> <a name="Page_205"></a>Valley between Cologne and Coblentz, numbers of little 
 fires burn on the heights and by the river-bank,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-81">8-81</a><a name="Nanchor_8-81"></a> the young people leap through the flames and dance 
 about them, and the ashes are strewn on the fields to make them fertile.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-82">8-82</a><a name="Nanchor_8-82"></a> Survivals of fire-customs are found also in other 
 regions. In Belgium, Holland, and north-west Germany processions of children 
 with paper or turnip lanterns take place on St. Martin's Eve. In the Eichsfeld 
 district the little river Geislede glows with the light of candles placed in 
 floating nutshells. Even the practice of leaping through the fire survives in a 
 modified form, for in northern Germany it is not uncommon for people on St. 
 Martin's Day or Eve to jump over lighted candles set on the parlour floor.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-83">8-83</a><a name="Nanchor_8-83"></a> In the fifteenth century the Martinmas fires were so 
 many that the festival actually got the name of <i>Funkentag</i> (Spark Day).﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-84">8-84</a><a name="Nanchor_8-84"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">On St. Martin's Eve in Germany and the Low Countries we 
 begin to meet those winter visitors, bright saints and angels on the one hand, 
 mock-terrible bogeys and monsters on the other, who add so much to the romance 
 and mystery of the children's Christmas. Such visitors are to be found in many 
 countries, but it is in the lands of German speech that they take on the most 
 vivid and picturesque forms. St. Martin, St. Nicholas, Christkind, Knecht 
 Ruprecht, and the rest are very real and personal beings to the children, and 
 are awaited with pleasant expectation or mild dread. Often they are beheld not 
 merely with the imagination but with the bodily eye, when father or friend is 
 wondrously transformed into a supernatural figure.</p>
 <p>What are the origins of these holy or monstrous beings? It is hard to say 
 with certainty, for many elements, pagan and Christian, seem here to be closely 
 blended. It is pretty clear, however, that the grotesque half-animal shapes are 
 direct relics of heathendom, and it is highly probable that the forms of saints 
 or angels﻿—even, perhaps, of the Christ Child Himself﻿—represent attempts of the 
 Church to transform and sanctify alien things which she could not suppress. What 
 some of these may have been we shall tentatively guess as we go along. Though no 
 grown-up person would take the mimic Martin or Nicholas <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a> <a name="Page_206"></a>seriously nowadays, there seem to be at the root of them 
 things once regarded as of vital moment. Just as fairy-tales, originally serious 
 attempts to explain natural facts, have now become reading for children, so 
 ritual practices which our ancestors deemed of vast importance for human welfare 
 have become mere games to amuse the young.</p>
 <p>On St. Martin's Eve, to come back from speculation to the facts of popular 
 custom, the saint appears in the nurseries of Antwerp and other Flemish towns. 
 He is a man dressed up as a bishop, with a pastoral staff in his hand. His 
 business is to ask if the children have been “good,” and if the result of his 
 inquiries is satisfactory he throws down apples, nuts, and cakes. If not, it is 
 rods that he leaves behind. At Ypres he does not visibly appear, but children 
 hang up stockings filled with hay, and next morning find presents in them, left 
 by the saint in gratitude for the fodder provided for his horse. He is there 
 imagined as a rider on a white horse, and the same conception prevails in 
 Austrian Silesia, where he brings the “Martin's horns” already mentioned.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-85">8-85</a><a name="Nanchor_8-85"></a> In Silesia when it snows at Martinmas people say that 
 the saint is coming on his white horse, and there, it may be noted, the 
 <i>Schimmelreiter</i> appears at the same season.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-86">8-86</a><a name="Nanchor_8-86"></a> In certain respects, it has been suggested, St. 
 Martin may have taken the place of Woden.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-87">8-87</a><a name="Nanchor_8-87"></a> It is perhaps not without significance that, like the 
 god, he is a military hero, and conceived as a rider on horseback. At Düsseldorf 
 he used to be represented in his festival procession by a man riding on another 
 fellow's back.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-88">8-88</a><a name="Nanchor_8-88"></a> </p>
 <p>At Mechlin and other places children go round from house to house, singing 
 and collecting gifts. Often four boys with paper caps on their heads, dressed as 
 Turks, carry a sort of litter whereon St. Martin sits. He has a long white beard 
 of flax and a paper mitre and stole, and holds a large wooden spoon to receive 
 apples and other eatables that are given to the children, as well as a leather 
 purse for offerings of money.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-89">8-89</a><a name="Nanchor_8-89"></a> </p>
 <p>In the Ansbach region a different type of being used to appear﻿—Pelzmärten 
 (Skin Martin) by name; he ran about and frightened the children, before he threw 
 them their apples and nuts. In several places in Swabia, too, Pelzmärte was 
 known; <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a> <a name="Page_207"></a>he had a black face, a cow-bell hung on his person, and he 
 distributed blows as well as nuts and apples.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-90">8-90</a><a name="Nanchor_8-90"></a> In him there is obviously more of the pagan mummer 
 than the Christian bishop.</p>
 <p>In Belgium St. Martin is chiefly known as the bringer of apples and nuts for 
 children; in Bavaria and Austria he has a different aspect: a <i>gerte</i> or 
 rod, supposed to promote fruitfulness among cattle and prosperity in general, is 
 connected with his day. The rods are taken round by the neatherds to the 
 farmers, and one is given to each﻿—two to rich proprietors; they are to be used, 
 when spring comes, to drive out the cattle for the first time. In Bavaria they 
 are formed by a birch-bough with all the leaves and twigs stripped off﻿—except 
 at the top, to which oak-leaves and juniper-twigs are fastened. At Etzendorf a 
 curious old rhyme shows that the herdsman with the rod is regarded as the 
 representative of St. Martin.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-91">8-91</a><a name="Nanchor_8-91"></a> </p>
 <p>Can we connect this custom with the saint who brings presents to 
 youngsters?﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_92">92</a><a name="FNanchor_92"></a> There seems to be a point of contact when we note that 
 at Antwerp St. Martin throws down rods for naughty children as well as nuts and 
 apples for good ones, and that Pelzmärte in Swabia has blows to bestow as well 
 as gifts. St. Martin's main functions﻿—and, as we shall see, St. Nicholas has 
 the same﻿—are to beat the bad children and reward the good with apples, nuts, 
 and cakes. Can it be that the ethical distinction is of comparatively recent 
 origin, an invention perhaps for children when the customs came to be performed 
 solely for their benefit, and that the beating and the gifts were originally 
 shared by all alike and were of a sacramental character? We shall meet with more 
 whipping customs later on, they are common enough in folk-ritual, and are not 
 punishments, but kindly services; their purpose is to drive away evil 
 influences, and to bring to the flogged one the life-giving virtues of the tree 
 from which the twigs or boughs are taken.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-92">8-92</a><a name="Nanchor_8-92"></a> Both the flogging and the eating of fruit may, 
 indeed, be means of contact with the vegetation-spirit, the one in <a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a> <a name="Page_208"></a>an external, the other in a more internal way. Or possibly 
 the rod and the fruit may once have been conjoined, the beating being performed 
 with fruit-laden boughs in order to produce prosperity. It is noteworthy that at 
 Etzendorf so many head of cattle and loads of hay are augured for the farmer as 
 there are juniper-<i>berries</i> and twigs on St. Martin's <i>gerte</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-94">8-94</a><a name="Nanchor_8-94"></a> </p>
 <p>Attempts to account for the figures of SS. Martin and Nicholas in northern 
 folk-customs have been made along various lines. Some scholars regard them as 
 Christianizations of the pagan god Woden; but they might also be taken as akin 
 to the “first-foots” whom we shall meet on January 1﻿—visitors who bring 
 good luck﻿—or as maskers connected with animal sacrifices (Pelzmärte suggests 
 this), or again as related to the Boy Bishop, the Lord of Misrule and the 
 Twelfth Night King. May I suggest that some at least of their aspects could be 
 explained on the supposition that they represent administrants of primitive 
 vegetation sacraments, and that these administrants, once ordinary human beings, 
 have taken on the name and attributes of the saint who under the Christian 
 dispensation presides over the festival? In any case it is a strange irony of 
 history that around the festival of Martin of Tours, the zealous soldier of 
 Christ and deadly foe of heathenism, should have gathered so much that is 
 unmistakably pagan.</p>
