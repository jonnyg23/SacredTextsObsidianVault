 <p>The 'age' is the distance in degrees (from 0 to 360) that the moon
 has traversed in its orbit since it was new. The phase is percentage of the
 moons' face which is currently lit, (i.e., it is 100% at full
 and 0% at new). If the phase is currently increasing the moon
 is said to be waxing and if it is decreasing it is said to be waning.</p>
 <p>
 The first symbolic system is believed to be a bone from the Paleolithic
 with 28 scratches on it indicating a knowledge of the lunar cycle.
 The moon is also the basis of many of the calendars of the world,
 and is key to Jewish, Islamic, and Christian liturgical calendars;
 the exact dates of Rosh Hashana, Ramadan and Easter
 all depend on lunar events which vary from year to year.
 In some cases, such as the <a href="isldate.htm">Islamic calendar</a>,
 a particular phase of the moon must actually be observed at a given location.
