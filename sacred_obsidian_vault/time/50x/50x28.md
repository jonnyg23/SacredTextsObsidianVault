 <p>HUSH! my dear, lie still and slumber,<br> Holy angels guard thy bed!<br> Heavenly blessings without number<br> Gently falling on thy head.</p>  
 <p>How much better thou'rt attended<br> Than the Son of God could be,<br> When from heaven He descended<br> And became a child like thee!</p>  
 <p>Soft and easy is thy cradle:<br> Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,<br> When His birthplace was a stable<br> And His softest bed was hay.</p>  
 <p>See the kinder shepherds round Him,<br> Telling wonders from the sky!<br> Where they sought Him, there they found Him,<br> With His Virgin Mother by.</p>  
 <p>See the lovely babe adressing;<br> Lovely infant, how He smiled!<br> When He wept, the Mother's blessing<br> Soothed and hush'd the holy child.</p>  
 <p>Lo, He slumbers in His manger,<br> Where the horned oxen fed:<br> Peace, my darling; here's no danger,<br> Here's no ox anear thy bed.</p>  
 <p>--ISAAC WATTS</p>
