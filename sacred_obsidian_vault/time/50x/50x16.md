 <p>WHY is there such a dancing din<br> About the stable of the inn?<br> "An old man, winter white, is here<br> A wayfarer he doth appear."</p>  
 <p>"If this be all, why is the night<br> Lit up with this unearthly light?"<br> "A maid, the fairest maid, is here,<br> Some great Lady she doth appear."</p>  
 <p>"But even so, why do there fly<br> Such flocks of Angels from the sky?"<br> "A Babe, a most sweet flower, is here,<br> A Child from Heaven He doth appear."</p>  <h4 align="center">II. COCKADOODLEDOO!</h4>  
 <p>COCKADOODLEDOO!<br> Our Lady's lost her shoe,<br> St. Joseph's lost his lantern,<br> What will they do?<br> The Child will be both Shoes and Staff<br> And a Lantern too.<br> In the dark night He'll be their Light.<br> And their Guide so true<br> Cockadoodledoo!</p>  
 <p>They that slept for sorrow<br> Wake on a glad morrow,<br> Their goal won,<br> Their travel done,<br> Their trouble thro'--<br> How cunning is His little laugh<br> His eyes how blue!<br> Cockadoodledoo!<br> The sun is high in Egypt's sky,<br> Cockadoodledoo!</p>  <h4 align="center">III. A CHILDERMAS RHYME</h4>  
 <p>BABES in the wood<br> Babes in the tower,<br> Babes killed at Childermas<br> In an evil hour,<br> Babe safe in Egypt<br> From the tyrant's power,</p>  
 <p>Wicked uncles, wicked kings,<br> Robbers counting chains and rings,<br> Wicked kings who killed for greed,<br> A good thief who stole for need,<br> Herod gone and Crookback sped,<br> The old villainous uncle dead,<br> When the Babe is crowned a King<br> That good thief will find his meed<br> In a green place where robins sing,<br> Where the holy babes and meek<br> In the wood play hide-and-seek.</p>  
 <p>--R. L. GALES</p>
