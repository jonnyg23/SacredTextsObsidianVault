 <p>OVER the frozen plain snow-white<br> The three Kings will come tonight;<br> We shall know by the kettle-drums<br> Which way the procession comes.</p>  
 <p>They have come from very far,<br> Following fast behind a Star,<br> In their shimmering robes of silk,<br> Riding horses white as milk.</p>  
 <p>They bring thro' the starlit dark<br> Gold once hid in Noë's Ark;<br> They bear over snow and ice<br> Bags of musk and myrrh and spice.</p>  
 <p>They have brought from the warm countree<br> Cloves like nails from a blossoming tree,<br> Flowers of a branch of a Tree that grew<br> In Eden when the world was new.</p>  
 <p>They have heard of a wondrous thing,<br> That here is born a little King;<br> They bring treasures of great worth<br> To the Treasure of the earth.</p>  
 <p>When we see the Kings ride past,<br> Thro' the silence white and vast,<br> In the night will bloom, methinks,<br> Velvet roses and striped pinks.</p>  
 <p>When we see them all aglow<br> Riding over leagues of snow,<br> In their robes of red and gold,<br> We shall never feel the cold.</p>  
 <p>We will print upon the gifts<br> They have borne thro' the snow-drifts,<br> Thro' the bitter weather wild,<br> Kisses for the little Child.</p>
