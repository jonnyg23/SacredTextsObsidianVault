 <p>LOVING looks the large-eyed cow,<br> Loving stares the long-eared ass<br> At Heaven's glory in the grass!<br> Child, with added human birth<br> Come to bring the child of earth<br> Glad repentance, tearful mirth,<br> And a seat beside the hearth<br> At the Father's knee--<br> Make us peaceful as thy cow;<br> Make us patient as thine ass;<br> Make us quiet as thou art now;<br> Make us strong as thou wilt be.<br> Make us always know and see<br> We are his, as well as thou.</p>
