 <p>THE holly and the ivy,<br> Now are both well grown.<br> Of all the trees that are in the wood<br> The holly bears the crown.</p>  
 <p>The holly bears a blossom<br> As white as the lily flower,<br> And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br> To be our sweet Saviour.</p>  
 <p>The holly bears a berry<br> As red as any blood,<br> And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br> To do poor sinners good.</p>  
 <p>The holly bears a prickle<br> As sharp as any thorn,<br> And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br> On Christmas Day in the morn.</p>  
 <p>The holly bears a bark<br> As bitter as any gall,<br> And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br> For to redeem us all.</p>  
 <p>The holly and the ivy<br> Now are both well grown,<br> Of all the trees that are in the wood<br> The holly bears the crown.</p>
