 <p>And who was in those ships all three,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?<br> And who was in those ships all three,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning?</p>

 <p>O they sailed into Bethlehem,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> O they sailed into Bethlehem,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
 <p>And all the bells on Earth shall ring,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> And all the bells on Earth shall ring,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
 <p>And all the angels in Heaven shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> And all the angels in Heaven shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
 <p>And all the souls on Earth shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> And all the souls on Earth shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>
