 <p>BUT peaceful was the night<br> Wherein the Prince of light<br> His reign of peace upon the earth began:<br> The winds, with wonder whist,<br> Smoothly the waters kist<br> Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,<br> Who now hath quite forgot to rave,<br> While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.</p>  
 <p>The shepherds on the lawn,<br> Or ere the point of dawn,<br> Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;<br> Full little thought they than,<br> That the mighty Pan<br> Was kindly come to live with them below:<br> Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,<br> Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.</p>  
 <p>When such music sweet<br> Their hearts and ears did greet,<br> As never was by mortal finger strook,<br> Divinely-warbled voice<br> Answering the stringed noise,<br> As all their souls in blissful rapture took;<br> The air such pleasure loth to lose,<br> With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.</p>  
 <p>Ring out, ye crystal spheres,<br> Once bless our human ears,<br> (If ye have power to touch our senses so)<br> And let your silver chime<br> Move in melodious time;<br> And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow,<br> And with your ninefold harmony<br> Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.</p>  
 <p>For if such holy song<br> Enwrap our fancy long,<br> Time will run back and fetch the age of gold,<br> And speckled Vanity<br> Will sicken soon and die,<br> And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould,<br> And Hell itself will pass away,<br> And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.</p>  
 <p>But see! the Virgin blest,<br> Hath laid her Babe to rest,<br> Time is our tedious song should here have ending,<br> Heaven's youngest teemed star,<br> Hath fix'd her polish'd car,<br> Her sleeping Lord with hand-maid lamp attending:<br> And all about the courtly stable,<br> Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.</p>
