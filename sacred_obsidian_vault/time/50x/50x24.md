 <p>THE Christ-child lay on Mary's lap,<br> His hair was like a light.<br> (O weary, weary were the world,<br> But here is all aright.)</p>  
 <p>The Christ-child lay on Mary's breast,<br> His hair was like a star.<br> (O stern and cunning are the Kings,<br> But here the true hearts are.)</p>  
 <p>The Christ-child lay on Mary's heart,<br> His hair was like a fire.<br> (O weary, weary is the world,<br> But here the world's desire.)</p>  
 <p>The Christ-child stood at Mary's knee,<br> His hair was like a crown,<br> And all the flowers looked up at Him<br> And all the stars looked down.</p>
