 <p>BEFORE the paling of the stars,<br> Before the winter morn,<br> Before the earliest cock-crow,<br> Jesus Christ was born:<br> Born in a stable,<br> Cradled in a manger,<br> In the world His Hands had made<br> Born a stranger.</p>  
 <p>Priest and King lay fast asleep<br> In Jerusalem,<br> Young and old lay fast asleep<br> In crowded Bethlehem:<br> Saint and angel, ox and ass,<br> Kept a watch together<br> Before the Christmas daybreak<br> In the winter weather.</p>  
 <p>Jesus on His mother's breast<br> In the stable cold,<br> Spotless Lamb of God was He,<br> Shepherd of the Fold:<br> Let us kneel with Mary Maid,<br> With Joseph bent and hoary,<br> With saint and angel, ox and ass,<br> To hail the King of Glory.</p>  
 <p>--CHRISTINA ROSSETTI</p>
