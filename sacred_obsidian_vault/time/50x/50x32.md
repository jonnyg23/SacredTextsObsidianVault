 <p>WHEN Christ was born of Mary free,<br> In Bethlehem in that fair citie,<br> Angels sang there with mirth and glee,<br> In Excelsis Gloria!</p>  
 <p>Herdsmen beheld these angels bright,<br> To them appearing with great light,<br> Who said, "God's Son is born this night,"<br> In Excelsis Gloria!</p>  
 <p>This King is come to save mankind,<br> As in Scripture truths we find,<br> Therefore this song have we in mind,<br> In Excelsis Gloria!</p>  
 <p>Then, dear Lord, for Thy great grace,<br> Grant us the bliss to see Thy face,<br> That we may sing to Thy solace,<br> In Excelsis Gloria!</p>
