 <p>THE frost of the moon fell over my floor<br> And six green singers stood at my door.</p>  
 <p>"What do ye here that music make?"<br> "Let us come in for Christ's sweet Sake."</p>  
 <p>"Long have ye journeyed in coming here?"<br> "Our Pilgrimage was the length of the year."</p>  
 <p>"Where do ye make for?" I asked of them.<br> "Our Shrine is a Stable in Bethlehem."</p>  
 <p>"What will ye do as ye go along?"<br> "Sing to the world an ever-green song."</p>  
 <p>"What will ye sing for the listening earth?"<br> "One will sing of a brave-souled Mirth,</p>  
 <p>"One of the Holiest Mystery,<br> The Glory of glories shall one song be,</p>  
 <p>"One of the Memory of things,<br> One of the Child's imaginings,</p>  
 <p>"One of our songs is the fadeless Faith,<br> And all are the Life more mighty than death."</p>  
 <p>"Ere ye be gone that music make,<br> Give me an alms for Christ's sweet Sake."</p>  
 <p>"Six green branches we leave with you;<br> See they be scattered your house-place through.</p>  
 <p>"The staunch blithe Holly your board shall grace,<br> Mistletoe bless your chimney place,</p>  
 <p>"Laurel to crown your lighted hail,<br> Over your bed let the Yew-bough fall,</p>  
 <p>"Close by the cradle the Christmas Fir,<br> For elfin dreams in its branches stir,</p>  
 <p>"Last and loveliest, high and low,<br> From ceil to floor let the Ivy go."</p>  
 <p>From each glad guest I received my gift<br> And then the latch of my door did lift--</p>  
 <p>"Green singers, God prosper the song ye make<br> As ye sing to the world for Christ's sweet Sake."</p>  
 <p>--ELEANOR FARJEON</p>
