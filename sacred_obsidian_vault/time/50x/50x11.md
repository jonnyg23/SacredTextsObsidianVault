 <p>AS Joseph was a walking<br> He heard an angel sing:<br> "This night shall be born<br> Our heavenly king.</p>  
 <p>"He neither shall be born<br> In housen nor in hall,<br> Nor in the place of Paradise,<br> But in an ox's stall.</p>  
 <p>"He neither shall be clothed<br> In purple nor in pall,<br> But all in fair linen,<br> As were babies all.</p>  
 <p>"He neither shall be rocked<br> In silver nor in gold,<br> But in a wooden cradle,<br> That rocks on the mould.</p>  
 <p>"He neither shall be christened<br> In white wine nor red,<br> But with fair spring water,<br> With which we were christened."</p>  
 <p>Then Mary took her young son,<br> And set him on her knee:<br> "I pray thee now, dear child,<br> Tell how this world shall be."</p>  
 <p>"O I shall be as dead, mother,<br> As the stones in the wall;<br> O the stones in the street, mother,<br> Shall mourn for me all.</p>  
 <p>"And upon a Wednesday<br> My vow I will make,<br> And upon Good Friday<br> My death I will take.</p>  
 <p>"Upon Easter-day, mother,<br> My rising shall be;<br> O the sun and the moon<br> Shall uprise with me.</p>  
 <p>"The people shall rejoice,<br> And the birds they shall sing,<br> To see the uprising<br> Of the heavenly king."</p>
