 <p>A BOY was Born at Bethlehem<br> that knew the haunts of Galilee.<br> He wandered on Mount Lebanon,<br> and learned to love each forest tree.</p>  
 <p>But I was born at Marlborough,<br> and love the homely faces there;<br> and for all other men besides<br> 'tis little love I have to spare.</p>  
 <p>I should not mind to die for them,<br> my own dear downs, my comrades true.<br> But that great heart of Bethlehem,<br> he died for men he never knew.</p>  
 <p>And yet, I think, at Golgotha,<br> as Jesus' eyes were closed in death,<br> they saw with love most passionate<br> the village street at Nazareth.</p>
