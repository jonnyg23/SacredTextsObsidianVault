 <p>CHRISTMAS Eve, and twelve of the clock.<br> "Now they are all on their knees,"<br> An elder said as we sat in a flock<br> By the embers in hearthside ease.</p>  
 <p>We pictured the meek mild creatures where<br> They dwelt in their strawy pen,<br> Nor did it occur to one of us there<br> To doubt they were kneeling then.</p>  
 <p>So fair a fancy few would weave<br> In these years! Yet, I feel,<br> If some one said on Christmas Eve,<br> "Come; see the oxen kneel</p>  
 <p>"In the lonely barton by yonder coomb<br> Our childhood used to know,"<br> I should go with him in the gloom<br> Hoping it might be so.</p>
