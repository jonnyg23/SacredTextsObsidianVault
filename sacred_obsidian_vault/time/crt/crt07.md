 <p>From a study of Christmas as reflected in lyric poetry, we now pass to other 
 forms of devotion in which the Church has welcomed the Redeemer at His birth. 
 These are of two kinds﻿—liturgical and popular; and they correspond in a large 
 degree to the successive ways of apprehending the meaning of Christmas which we 
 traced in the foregoing chapters. Strictly liturgical devotions are little 
 understanded of the people: only the clergy can fully join in them; for the mass 
 of the lay folk they are mysterious rites in an unknown tongue, to be followed 
 with reverence, as far as may be, but remote and little penetrated with 
 humanity. Side by side with these, however, are popular devotions, full of vivid 
 colour, highly anthropomorphic, bringing the mysteries of religion within the 
 reach of the simplest minds, and warm with human feeling. The austere Latin 
 hymns of the earlier centuries belong to liturgy; the vernacular Christmas 
 poetry of later ages is largely associated with popular devotion.</p>
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a> <a name="Page_90"></a>Liturgiology is a vast and complicated, and except to the 
 few, an unattractive, subject. To attempt here a survey of the liturgies in 
 their relation to Christmas is obviously impossible; we must be content to dwell 
 mainly upon the present-day Roman offices, which, in spite of various revisions, 
 give some idea of the mediaeval services of Latin Christianity, and to cast a 
 few glances at other western rites, and at those of the Greek Church.</p>
 <p>Whatever may be his attitude towards Catholicism, or, indeed, Christianity, 
 no one sensitive to the music of words, or the suggestions of poetic imagery, 
 can read the Roman Breviary and Missal without profound admiration for the 
 amazing skill with which the noblest passages of Hebrew poetry are chosen and 
 fitted to the expression of Christian devotion, and the gold of psalmists, 
 prophets, and apostles is welded into coronals for the Lord and His saints. The 
 office-books of the Roman Church are, in one aspect, the greatest of 
 anthologies.</p>
 <p>Few parts of the Roman Breviary have more beauty than the Advent﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_35">35</a><a name="FNanchor_35"></a> offices, where the Church has brought together the 
 majestic imagery of the Hebrew prophets, the fervent exhortation of the 
 apostles, to prepare the minds of the faithful for the coming of the Christ, for 
 the celebration of the Nativity.</p>
 <p>Advent begins with a stirring call. If we turn to the opening service of the 
 Christian Year, the First Vespers of the First Sunday in Advent, we shall find 
 as the first words in the “Proper of the Season” the trumpet-notes of St. Paul: 
 “Brethren, it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation 
 nearer than when we believed.” This, the Little Chapter for the office, is 
 followed by the ancient hymn, “Creator alme siderum,”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-1">4-1</a><a name="Nanchor_4-1"></a> chanting in awful tones the two comings of <a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a> <a name="Page_91"></a>Christ, for redemption and for judgment; and then are sung 
 the words that strike the keynote of the Advent services, and are heard again 
 and again.</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“<i>Rorate, coeli, desuper, et nubes pluant 
 Justum</i></span><br><span class="i2">(Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let 
 the skies pour down the Righteous One).</span><br><span class="i2"><i>Aperiatur 
 terra et germinet Salvatorem</i></span><br><span class="i2">(Let the earth open, 
 and let her bring forth the Saviour).”</span><br></div></div>
 <p><i>Rorate, coeli, desuper</i>﻿—Advent is a time of longing expectancy. It is 
 a season of waiting patiently for the Lord, whose coming in great humility is to 
 be commemorated at Christmas, to whose coming again in His glorious majesty to 
 judge both the quick and the dead the Christian looks forward with mingled hope 
 and awe. There are four weeks in Advent, and an ancient symbolical explanation 
 interprets these as typifying four comings of the Son of God: the first in the 
 flesh, the second in the hearts of the faithful through the Holy Spirit, the 
 third at the death of every man, and the fourth at the Judgment Day. The fourth 
 week is never completed (Christmas Eve is regarded as not part of Advent), 
 because the glory bestowed on the saints at the Last Coming will never end.</p>
 <p>The great Eucharistic hymn, “Gloria in excelsis,” is omitted in Advent, in 
 order, say the symbolists, that on Christmas night, when it was first sung by 
 the angels, it may be chanted with the greater eagerness and devotion. The “Te 
 Deum” at Matins too is left unsaid, because Christ is regarded as not yet come. 
 But “Alleluia” is not omitted, because Advent is only half a time of penitence: 
 there is awe at the thought of the Coming for Judgment, but joy also in the hope 
 of the Incarnation to be celebrated at Christmas, and the glory in store for the 
 faithful.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-3">4-3</a><a name="Nanchor_4-3"></a> </p>
 <p>Looking forward is above all things the note of Advent; the Church seeks to 
 share the mood of the Old Testament saints, and she draws more now than at any 
 other season, perhaps, on the treasures of Hebrew prophecy for her lessons, 
 antiphons, versicles, and responds. Looking for the glory that shall be 
 revealed, she awaits, at this darkest time of the year, the rising <a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a> <a name="Page_92"></a>of the Sun of Righteousness. <i>Rorate, coeli, 
 desuper</i>﻿—the mood comes at times to all idealists, and even those moderns 
 who hope not for a supernatural Redeemer, but for the triumph of social justice 
 on this earth, must be stirred by the poetry of the Advent offices.</p>
 <p>It is at Vespers on the seven days before Christmas Eve that the Church's 
 longing finds its noblest expression﻿—in the antiphons known as the “Great O's,” 
 sung before and after the “Magnificat,” one on each day. “O Sapientia,” runs the 
 first, “O Wisdom, which camest out of the mouth of the Most High, and reachest 
 from one end to another, mightily and sweetly ordering all things: come and 
 teach us the way of prudence.” “O Adonai,” “O Root of Jesse,” “O Key of David,” 
 “O Day-spring, Brightness of Light Everlasting,” “O King of the Nations,” thus 
 the Church calls to her Lord, “O Emmanuel, our King and Lawgiver, the Desire of 
 all nations, and their Salvation: come and save us, O Lord our God.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-4">4-4</a><a name="Nanchor_4-4"></a> </p>
 <p>At last Christmas Eve is here, and at Vespers we feel the nearness of the 
 great Coming. “Lift up your heads: behold your redemption draweth nigh,” is the 
 antiphon for the last psalm. “To-morrow shall be done away the iniquity of the 
 earth,” is the versicle after the Office Hymn. And before and after the 
 “Magnificat” the Church sings: “When the sun shall have risen, ye shall see the 
 King of kings coming forth from the Father, as a bridegroom out of his 
 chamber.”</p>
 <p>Yet only with the night office of Matins does the glory of the festival 
 begin. There is a special fitness at Christmas in the Church's keeping watch by 
 night, like the shepherds of Bethlehem, and the office is full of the poetry of 
 the season, full of exultant joy. To the “Venite, exultemus Domino” a Christmas 
 note is added by the oft-repeated Invitatory, “Unto us the Christ is born: O 
 come, let us adore Him.” Psalms follow﻿—among them the three retained by the 
 Anglican Church in her Christmas Matins﻿—and lessons from the Old and New 
 Testaments and the homilies of the Fathers, interspersed with Responsories 
 bringing home to the faithful the wonders of the Holy Night. Some are almost 
 dramatic; this, for instance:﻿—<a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a> <a name="Page_93"></a></p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Whom saw ye, O shepherds? speak; tell us who 
 hath appeared on the earth.</span><br><span class="i2">We saw the new-born Child, 
 and angels singing praise unto the Lord.</span><br><span class="i2">Speak, what 
 saw ye? and tell us of the birth of Christ.</span><br><span class="i2">We saw the 
 new-born Child, and angels singing praise unto the Lord.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>It is the wonder of the Incarnation, the marvel of the spotless Birth, the 
 song of the Angels, the coming down from heaven of true peace, the daybreak of 
 redemption and everlasting joy, the glory of the Only-begotten, now beheld by 
 men﻿—the supernatural side, in fact, of the festival, that the Church sets forth 
 in her radiant words; there is little thought of the purely human side, the 
 pathos of Bethlehem.</p>
 <p>It was customary at certain places, in mediaeval times, to lay on the altar 
 three veils, and remove one at each nocturn of Christmas Matins. The first was 
 black, and symbolised the time of darkness before the Mosaic Law; the second 
 white, typifying, it would seem, the faith of those who lived under that Law of 
 partial revelation; the third red, showing the love of Christ's bride, the 
 Church, in the time of grace flowing from the Incarnation.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-5">4-5</a><a name="Nanchor_4-5"></a> </p>
 <p>A stately ceremony took place in England in the Middle Ages at the end of 
 Christmas Matins﻿—the chanting of St. Matthew's genealogy of Christ. The deacon, 
 in his dalmatic, with acolytes carrying tapers, with thurifer and cross-bearer, 
 all in albs and unicles, went in procession to the pulpit or the rood-loft, to 
 sing this portion of the Gospel. If the bishop were present, he it was who 
 chanted it, and a rich candlestick was held to light him.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_36">36</a><a name="FNanchor_36"></a> Then followed the chanting of the “Te Deum.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-6">4-6</a><a name="Nanchor_4-6"></a> The ceremony does not appear in the ordinary Roman 
 books, but it is still performed by the Benedictines, as one may read in the 
 striking account of the monastic Christmas given by Huysmans in “L'Oblat.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-7">4-7</a><a name="Nanchor_4-7"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a> <a name="Page_94"></a>Where, as in religious communities, the offices of the Church 
 are performed in their full order, there follows on Matins that custom peculiar 
 to Christmas, the celebration of Midnight Mass. On Christmas morning every 
 priest is permitted to say three Masses, which should in strictness be 
 celebrated at midnight, at dawn, and in full daylight. Each has its own Collect, 
 Epistle, and Gospel, each its own Introit, Gradual, and other anthems. In many 
 countries the Midnight Mass is the distinctive Christmas service, a great and 
 unique event in the year, something which by its strangeness gives to the feast 
 of the Nativity a place by itself. Few Catholic rites are more impressive than 
 this Midnight Mass, especially in country places; through the darkness and cold 
 of the winter's night, often for long distances, the faithful journey to worship 
 the Infant Saviour in the splendour of the lighted church. It is a re-enactment 
 of the visit of the shepherds to the cave at Bethlehem, aglow with supernatural 
 light.</p>
 <p>Various symbolical explanations of the three Masses were given by mediaeval 
 writers. The midnight celebration was supposed to represent mankind's condition 
 before the Law of Moses, when thick darkness covered the earth; the second, at 
 dawn, the time of the Law and the Prophets with its growing light; the third, in 
 full daylight, the Christian era of light and grace. Another interpretation, 
 adopted by St. Thomas Aquinas, is more mystical; the three Masses stand for the 
 threefold birth of Christ, the first typifying the dark mystery of the eternal 
 generation of the Son, the second the birth of Christ the morning-star within 
 the hearts of men, the third the bodily birth of the Son of Mary.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-8">4-8</a><a name="Nanchor_4-8"></a> </p>
 <p>At the Christmas Masses the “Gloria in excelsis” resounds again. This song of 
 the angels was at first chanted only at Christmas; it was introduced into Rome 
 during the fifth century at Midnight Mass in imitation of the custom of the 
 Church of Jerusalem.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-9">4-9</a><a name="Nanchor_4-9"></a> </p>
 <p>It is, indeed, from imitation of the services at Jerusalem and Bethlehem that 
 the three Roman Masses of Christmas seem to have sprung. From a late 
 fourth-century document known as <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a> <a name="Page_95"></a>the “Peregrinatio Silviae,” the narrative of a pilgrimage to 
 the holy places of the east by a great lady from southern Gaul, it appears that 
 at the feast of the Epiphany﻿—when the Birth of Christ was commemorated in the 
 Palestinian Church﻿—two successive “stations” were held, one at Bethlehem, the 
 other at Jerusalem. At Bethlehem the station was held at night on the eve of the 
 feast, then a procession was made to the church of the Anastasis or 
 Resurrection﻿—where was the Holy Sepulchre﻿—arriving “about the hour when one 
 man begins to recognise another, <i>i.e.</i>, near daylight, but before the day 
 has fully broken.” There a psalm was sung, prayers were said, and the 
 catechumens and faithful were blessed by the bishop. Later, Mass was celebrated 
 at the Great Church at Golgotha, and the procession returned to the Anastasis, 
 where another Mass was said.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-10">4-10</a><a name="Nanchor_4-10"></a> </p>
 <p>At Bethlehem at the present time impressive services are held on the Latin 
 Christmas Day. The Patriarch comes from Jerusalem, with a troop of cavalry and 
 Kavasses in gorgeous array. The office lasts from 10 o'clock on Christmas Eve 
 until long after midnight. “At the reading of the Gospel the clergy and as many 
 of the congregation as can follow leave the church, and proceed by a flight of 
 steps and a tortuous rock-hewn passage to the Grotto of the Nativity, an 
 irregular subterranean chamber, long and narrow. They carry with them a waxen 
 image of an infant﻿—the <i>bambino</i>﻿—wrap it in swaddling bands and lay it on 
 the site which is said to be that of the manger.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-11">4-11</a><a name="Nanchor_4-11"></a> </p>
 <p>The Midnight Mass appears to have been introduced into Rome in the first half 
 of the fifth century. It was celebrated by the Pope in the church of Santa Maria 
 Maggiore, while the second Mass was sung by him at Sant Anastasia﻿—perhaps 
 because of the resemblance of the name to the Anastasis at Jerusalem﻿—and the 
 third at St. Peter's.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-12">4-12</a><a name="Nanchor_4-12"></a> On Christmas Eve the Pope held a solemn “station” at 
 Santa Maria Maggiore, and two Vespers were sung, the first very simple, the 
 second, at which the Pope pontificated, with elaborate ceremonial. Before the 
 second Vespers, in the twelfth century, a good meal had to <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a> <a name="Page_96"></a>be prepared for the papal household by the Cardinal-Bishop of 
 Albano. After Matins and Midnight Mass at Santa Maria Maggiore, the Pope went in 
 procession to Sant Anastasia for Lauds and the Mass of the Dawn. The third 
 Mass, at St. Peter's, was an event of great solemnity, and at it took place in 
 the year 800 that profoundly significant event, the coronation of Charlemagne by 
 Leo III.﻿—a turning-point in European history.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-13">4-13</a><a name="Nanchor_4-13"></a> </p>
 <p>Later it became the custom for the Pope, instead of proceeding to St. 
 Peter's, to return to Santa Maria Maggiore for the third Mass. On his arrival he 
 was given a cane with a lighted candle affixed to it; with this he had to set 
 fire to some tow placed on the capitals of the columns.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-14">4-14</a><a name="Nanchor_4-14"></a> The ecclesiastical explanation of this strange 
 ceremony was that it symbolised the end of the world by fire, but one may 
 conjecture that some pagan custom lay at its root. Since 1870 the Pope, as “the 
 prisoner of the Vatican,” has of course ceased to celebrate at Santa Maria 
 Maggiore or Sant Anastasia. The Missal, however, still shows a trace of the 
 papal visit to Sant Anastasia in a commemoration of this saint which comes as a 
 curious parenthesis in the Mass of the Dawn.</p>
 <p>On Christmas Day in the Vatican the Pope blesses a hat and a sword, and these 
 are sent as gifts to some prince. The practice is said to have arisen from the 
 mediaeval custom for the Holy Roman Emperor or some other sovereign to read one 
 of the lessons at Christmas Matins, in the papal chapel, with his sword 
 drawn.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-15">4-15</a><a name="Nanchor_4-15"></a> </p>
 <p>Celebrated in countries as distant from one another, both geographically and 
 in character, as Ireland and Sicily, Poland and South America, the Midnight Mass 
 naturally varies greatly in its tone and setting. Sometimes it is little more 
 than a fashionable function, sometimes the devotion of those who attend is shown 
 by a tramp over miles of snow through the darkness and the bitter wind.</p>
 <p>In some charming memories of the Christmas of her childhood, Madame Th. 
 Bentzon thus describes the walk to the Midnight Mass in a French country place 
 about sixty years ago:﻿—<a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a> <a name="Page_97"></a></p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“I can see myself as a little girl, bundled up to the tip of my nose in 
   furs and knitted shawls, tiny wooden shoes on my feet, a lantern in my hand, 
   setting out with my parents for the Midnight Mass of Christmas Eve.... We 
   started off, a number of us, together in a stream of light.... Our lanterns 
   cast great shadows on the white road, crisp with frost. As our little group 
   advanced it saw others on their way, people from the farm and from the mill, 
   who joined us, and once on the Place de lÉglise we found ourselves with all 
   the parishioners in a body. No one spoke﻿—the icy north wind cut short our 
   breath; but the voice of the chimes filled the silence.... We entered, 
   accompanied by a gust of wind that swept into the porch at the same time we 
   did; and the splendours of the altar, studded with lights, green with pine and 
   laurel branches, dazzled us from the threshold.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-16">4-16</a><a name="Nanchor_4-16"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>In devout Tyrol, the scenes on Christmas Eve before the Midnight Mass are 
 often extremely impressive, particularly in narrow valleys where the houses lie 
 scattered on the mountain slopes. Long before midnight the torches lighting the 
 faithful on their way to Mass begin to twinkle; downward they move, now hidden 
 in pine-woods and ravines, now reappearing on the open hill-side. More and more 
 lights show themselves and throw ruddy flashes on the snow, until at last, the 
 floor of the valley reached, they vanish, and only the church windows glow 
 through the darkness, while the solemn strains of the organ and chanting break 
 the silence of the night.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-17">4-17</a><a name="Nanchor_4-17"></a> </p>
 <p>Not everywhere has the great Mass been celebrated amid scenes so still and 
 devotional. In Madrid, says a writer of the early nineteenth century, “the 
 evening of the vigil is scarcely dark when numbers of men, women, and boys are 
 seen traversing the streets with torches, and many of them supplied with 
 tambourines, which they strike loudly as they move along in a kind of Bacchanal 
 procession. There is a tradition here that the shepherds who visited Bethlehem 
 on the day of the Nativity had instruments of this sort upon which they 
 expressed the sentiment of joy that animated them when they received the 
 intelligence that a Saviour was born.” At the Midnight Mass crowds of people 
 who, perhaps, had been traversing the streets the whole night, came into the 
 church <a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a> <a name="Page_98"></a>with their tambourines and guitars, and accompanied the 
 organ. The Mass over, they began to dance in the very body of the church.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-18">4-18</a><a name="Nanchor_4-18"></a> A later writer speaks of the Midnight Mass in Madrid 
 as a fashionable function to which many gay young people went in order to meet 
 one another.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-19">4-19</a><a name="Nanchor_4-19"></a> Such is the character of the service in the 
 Spanish-American cities. In Lima the streets on Christmas Eve are crowded with 
 gaily dressed and noisy folks, many of them masked, and everybody goes to the 
 Mass.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-20">4-20</a><a name="Nanchor_4-20"></a> In Paris the elaborate music attracts enormous and 
 often not very serious crowds. In Sicily there is sometimes extraordinary 
 irreverence at the midnight services: people take provisions with them to eat in 
 church, and from time to time go out to an inn for a drink, and between the 
 offices they imitate the singing of birds.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-21">4-21</a><a name="Nanchor_4-21"></a> We may see in such things the licence of pagan 
 festivals creeping within the very walls of the sanctuary.</p>
 <p>In the Rhineland Midnight Mass has been abolished, because the conviviality 
 of Christmas Eve led to unseemly behaviour at the solemn service, but Mass is 
 still celebrated very early﻿—at four or five﻿—and great crowds of worshippers 
 attend. It is a stirring thing, this first Mass of Christmas, in some ancient 
 town, when from the piercing cold, the intense stillness of the early morning, 
 one enters a great church thronged with people, bright with candles, warm with 
 human fellowship, and hears the vast congregation break out into a slow solemn 
 chorale, full of devout joy that</p>

 <p>It is interesting to trace survivals of the nocturnal Christmas offices in 
 Protestant countries. In German “Evangelical” churches, midnight or early 
 morning services were common in the eighteenth century; but they were forbidden 
 in some places because of the riot and drunkenness which accompanied them. The 
 people seem to have regarded them as a part of their Christmas revellings rather 
 than as sacred functions; one writer compares the congregation to a crowd of 
 wild drunken sailors in a <a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a> <a name="Page_99"></a>tavern, another gives disgusting particulars of disorders in 
 a church where the only sober man was the preacher.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-22">4-22</a><a name="Nanchor_4-22"></a> </p>
 <p>In Sweden the Christmas service is performed very early in the morning, the 
 chancel is lighted up with many candles, and the celebrant is vested in a white 
 chasuble with golden orphreys.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-23">4-23</a><a name="Nanchor_4-23"></a> </p>
 <p>A Midnight Mass is now celebrated in many Anglican churches, but this is 
 purely a modern revival. The most distinct British <i>survival</i> is to be 
 found in Wales in the early service known as <i>Plygain</i> (dawn), sometimes a 
 celebration of the Communion. At Tenby at four o'clock on Christmas morning it 
 was customary for the young men of the town to escort the rector with lighted 
 torches from his house to the church. Extinguishing their torches in the porch, 
 they went in to the early service, and when it was ended the torches were 
 relighted and the procession returned to the rectory. At St. Peter's Church, 
 Carmarthen, an early service was held, to the light of coloured candles brought 
 by the congregation. At St. Asaph, Caerwys, at 4 or 5 a.m., <i>Plygain</i>, 
 consisting of carols sung round the church in procession, was held.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-24">4-24</a><a name="Nanchor_4-24"></a> The <i>Plygain</i> continued in Welsh churches until 
 about the eighteen-fifties, and, curiously enough, when the Established Church 
 abandoned it, it was celebrated in Nonconformist chapels.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-25">4-25</a><a name="Nanchor_4-25"></a> </p>
 <p>In the Isle of Man on Christmas Eve, or <i>Oiel Verry</i> (Mary's Eve), “a 
 number of persons used to assemble in each parish church and proceed to shout 
 carols or Carvals. There was no unison or concert about the chanting, but a 
 single person would stand up with a lighted candle in his or her hand, and chant 
 in a dismal monotone verse after verse of some old Manx Carval, until the 
 candle was burnt out. Then another person would start up and go through a 
 similar performance. No fresh candles might be lighted after the clock had 
 chimed midnight.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-26">4-26</a><a name="Nanchor_4-26"></a> </p>
 <p>One may conjecture that the common English practice of ringing bells until 
 midnight on Christmas Eve has also some connection with the old-time Midnight 
 Mass.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">For the Greek Church Christmas is a comparatively 
 unimportant festival by the side of the Epiphany, the celebration of <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a> <a name="Page_100"></a>Christ's Baptism; the Christmas offices are, however, full 
 of fine poetry. There is far less restraint, far less adherence to the words of 
 Scripture, far greater richness of original composition, in the Greek than in 
 the Roman service-books, and while there is less poignancy there is more 
 amplitude and splendour. Christmas Day, with the Greeks, is a commemoration of 
 the coming of the Magi as well as of the Nativity and the adoration of the 
 shepherds, and the Wise Men are very prominent in the services. The following 
 hymn of St. Anatolius (fifth century), from the First Vespers of the feast, is 
 fairly typical of the character of the Christmas offices:﻿—</p>

 <p>A beautiful rite called the “Peace of God” is performed in Slavonic churches 
 at the end of the “Liturgy” or Mass on Christmas morning﻿—the people kiss one 
 another on both cheeks, saying, “Christ is born!” To this the answer is made, 
 “Of a truth He is born!” and the kisses are returned. This is repeated till 
 everyone has kissed and been kissed by all present.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-28">4-28</a><a name="Nanchor_4-28"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">We must pass rapidly over the feasts of saints within the 
 Octave of the western Christmas, St. Stephen (December 26), St. John the 
 Evangelist (December 27), the Holy Innocents (December 28), and St. 
 Sylvester (December 31). None of these, except the feast of the Holy 
 Innocents, have any special connection with the Nativity or the Infancy, and the 
 popular customs connected with them will come up for consideration in our Second 
 Part.</p>
 <p>The commemoration of the Circumcision (“when eight days were accomplished for 
 the circumcising of the child”) falls naturally on January 1, the Octave of 
 Christmas. It is not of Roman origin, and was not observed in Rome until it had 
 long been established in the Byzantine and Gallican Churches.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-29">4-29</a><a name="Nanchor_4-29"></a> In Gaul, as is shown by a decree of the Council of 
 Tours in 567, a solemn fast was held on the Circumcision and the two days 
 following it, in order to turn away the faithful from the pagan festivities of 
 the Kalends.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-30">4-30</a><a name="Nanchor_4-30"></a> </p>
 <p>The feast of the Epiphany on January 6, as we have seen, is in the 
 eastern Church a commemoration of the Baptism of Christ. In the West it has 
 become primarily the festival of the adoration <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a> <a name="Page_102"></a>of the Magi, the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles. 
 Still in the Roman offices many traces of the baptismal commemoration remain, 
 and the memory of yet another manifestation of Christ's glory appears in the 
 antiphon at “Magnificat” at the Second Vespers of the feast:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“We keep holy a day adorned by three wonders: to-day a star led the Magi to 
   the manger; to-day at the marriage water was made wine; to-day for our 
   salvation Christ was pleased to be baptized of John in Jordan. 
 Alleluia.”</p></blockquote>
 <p>On the Octave of the Epiphany at Matins the Baptism is the central idea, and 
 the Gospel at Mass bears on the same subject. In Rome itself even the Blessing 
 of the Waters, the distinctive ceremony of the eastern Epiphany rite, is 
 performed in certain churches according to a Latin ritual.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-31">4-31</a><a name="Nanchor_4-31"></a> At Sant Andrea della Valle, Rome, during the Octave 
 of the Epiphany a Solemn Mass is celebrated every morning in Latin, and 
 afterwards, on each of the days from January 7-13, there follows a Mass 
 according to one of the eastern rites: Greco-Slav, Armenian, Chaldean, Coptic, 
 Greco-Ruthenian, Greco-Melchite, and Greek.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-32">4-32</a><a name="Nanchor_4-32"></a> It is a week of great opportunities for the 
 liturgiologist and the lover of strange ceremonial.</p>
 <p>The Blessing of the Waters is an important event in all countries where the 
 Greek Church prevails. In Greece the “Great Blessing,” as it is called, is 
 performed in various ways according to the locality; sometimes the sea is 
 blessed, sometimes a river or reservoir, sometimes merely water in a church. In 
 seaport towns, where the people depend on the water for their living, the 
 celebration has much pomp and elaborateness. At the Piraeus enormous and 
 enthusiastic crowds gather, and there is a solemn procession of the bishop and 
 clergy to the harbour, where the bishop throws a little wooden cross, held by a 
 long blue ribbon, into the water, withdraws it dripping wet, and sprinkles the 
 bystanders. This is done three times. At Nauplia and other places a curious 
 custom prevails: the archbishop throws a wooden cross into the waters of the 
 harbour, and the fishermen <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a> <a name="Page_103"></a>of the place dive in after it and struggle for its 
 possession; he who wins it has the right of visiting all the houses of the town 
 and levying a collection, which often brings in a large sum. In Samos all the 
 women send to the church a vessel full of water to be blessed by the priest; 
 with this water the fields and the trees are sprinkled.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-33">4-33</a><a name="Nanchor_4-33"></a> </p>
 <p>The sense attached to the ceremony by the Church is shown in this 
 prayer:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“Thou didst sanctify the streams of Jordan by sending from Heaven Thy Holy 
   Spirit, and by breaking the heads of the dragons lurking there. Therefore, O 
   King, Lover of men, be Thou Thyself present also now by the visitation of Thy 
   Holy Spirit, and sanctify this water. Give also to it the grace of ransom, the 
   blessing of Jordan: make it a fountain of incorruption; a gift of 
   sanctification; a washing away of sins; a warding off of diseases; destruction 
   to demons; repulsion to the hostile powers; filled with angelic strength; that 
   all who take and receive of it may have it for purification of souls and 
   bodies, for healing of sicknesses, for sanctification of houses, and meet for 
   every need.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-34">4-34</a><a name="Nanchor_4-34"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>Though for the Church the immersion of the cross represents the Baptism of 
 Christ, and the blessings springing from that event are supposed to be carried 
 to the people by the sprinkling with the water, it is held by some students that 
 the whole practice is a Christianization of a primitive rain-charm﻿—a piece of 
 sympathetic magic intended to produce rain by imitating the drenching which it 
 gives. An Epiphany song from Imbros connects the blessing of rain with the 
 Baptism of Christ, and another tells how at the river Jordan “a dove came down, 
 white and feathery, and with its wings opened; it sent rain down on the Lord, 
 and again it rained and rained on our Lady, and again it rained and rained on 
 its wings.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-35">4-35</a><a name="Nanchor_4-35"></a> </p>
 <p>The Blessing of the Waters is performed in the Greek church of St. Sophia, 
 Bayswater, London, on the morning of the Epiphany, which, through the difference 
 between the old and new “styles,” falls on our 19th of January. All is done 
 within the church; the water to be blessed is placed on a table under <a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a> <a name="Page_104"></a>the dome, and is sanctified by the immersion of a small 
 cross; afterwards it is sprinkled on everyone present, and some is taken home by 
 the faithful in little vessels.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-36">4-36</a><a name="Nanchor_4-36"></a> </p>
 <p>In Moscow and St. Petersburg the Blessing is a function of great 
 magnificence, but it is perhaps even more interesting as performed in Russian 
 country places. Whatever may be the orthodox significance of the rite, to the 
 country people it is the chasing away of “forest demons, sprites, and fairies, 
 once the gods the peasants worshipped, but now dethroned from their high 
 estate,” who in the long dark winter nights bewitch and vex the sons of men. A 
 vivid and imaginative account of the ceremony and its meaning to the peasants is 
 given by Mr. F. H. E. Palmer in his “Russian Life in Town and Country.” The 
 district in which he witnessed it was one of forests and of lakes frozen in 
 winter. On one of these lakes had been erected “a huge cross, constructed of 
 blocks of ice, that glittered like diamonds in the brilliant winter sunlight.... 
 At length, far away could be heard the sound of human voices, singing a strange, 
 wild melody. Presently there was a movement in the snow among the trees, and 
 waving banners appeared as a procession approached, headed by the pope in his 
 vestments, and surrounded by the village dignitaries, venerable, grey-bearded 
 patriarchs.” A wide space in the procession was left for “a strange and motley 
 band of gnomes and sprites, fairies and wood-nymphs,” who, as the peasants 
 believed, had been caught by the holy singing and the sacred sign on the waving 
 banner. The chanting still went on as the crowd formed a circle around the 
 glittering cross, and all looked on with awe while half a dozen peasants with 
 their axes cut a large hole in the ice. “And now the priest's voice is heard, 
 deep and sonorous, as he pronounces the words of doom. Alas for the poor 
 sprites! Into that yawning chasm they must leap, and sink deep, deep below the 
 surface of that ice-cold water.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-37">4-37</a><a name="Nanchor_4-37"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">Following these eastern Epiphany rites we have wandered 
 far from the cycle of ideas generally associated with Christmas. We <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a> <a name="Page_105"></a>must now pass to those popular devotions to the Christ 
 Child which, though they form no part of the Church's liturgy, she has permitted 
 and encouraged. It is in the West that we shall find them; the Latin Church, as 
 we have seen, makes far more of Christmas than the Greek.</p>
 <p>Rome is often condemned for using in her liturgy the dead language of Latin, 
 but it must not be forgotten that in every country she offers to the faithful a 
 rich store of devotional literature in their own tongue, and that, supplementary 
 to the liturgical offices, there is much public prayer and praise in the 
 vernacular. Nor, in that which appeals to the eye, does she limit herself to the 
 mysterious symbolism of the sacraments and the ritual which surrounds them; she 
 gives to the people concrete, pictorial images to quicken their faith. How 
 ritual grew in mediaeval times into full-fledged drama we shall see in the next 
 chapter; here let us consider that cult of the Christ Child in which the scene 
 of Bethlehem is represented not by living actors but in plastic art, often most 
 simple and homely.</p>
 <p>The use of the “crib” (French <i>crèche</i>, Italian <i>presepio</i>, German 
 <i>krippe</i>) at Christmas is now universally diffused in the Roman Church. 
 Most readers of this book must have seen one of these structures representing 
 the stable at Bethlehem, with the Child in the manger, His mother and St. 
 Joseph, the ox and the ass, and perhaps the shepherds, the three kings, or 
 worshipping angels. They are the delight of children, who through the season of 
 Christmas and Epiphany wander into the open churches at all times of day to gaze 
 wide-eyed on the life-like scene and offer a prayer to their Little Brother. No 
 one with anything of the child-spirit can fail to be touched by the charm of the 
 Christmas crib. Faults of artistic taste there may often be, but these are wont 
 to be softened down by the flicker of tapers, the glow of ruby lights, amidst 
 the shades of some dim aisle or chapel, and the scene of tender humanity, 
 gently, mysteriously radiant, as though with “bright shoots of everlastingness,” 
 is full of religious and poetic suggestions.</p>
 <p>The institution of the <i>presepio</i> is often ascribed to St. Francis of 
 Assisi, who in the year 1224 celebrated Christmas at Greccio <a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a> <a name="Page_106"></a>with a Bethlehem scene with a real ox and ass. About 
 fifteen days before the Nativity, according to Thomas of Celano, the blessed 
 Francis sent for a certain nobleman, John by name, and said to him: “If thou 
 wilt that we celebrate the present festival of the Lord at Greccio, make haste 
 to go before and diligently prepare what I tell thee. For I would fain make 
 memorial of that Child who was born in Bethlehem, and in some sort behold with 
 bodily eyes His infant hardships; how He lay in a manger on the hay, with the ox 
 and the ass standing by.” The good man prepared all that the Saint had 
 commanded, and at last the day of gladness drew nigh. The brethren were called 
 from many convents; the men and women of the town prepared tapers and torches to 
 illuminate the night. Finding all things ready, Francis beheld and rejoiced: the 
 manger had been prepared, the hay was brought, and the ox and ass were led in. 
 “Thus Simplicity was honoured, Poverty exalted, Humility commended, and of 
 Greccio there was made as it were a new Bethlehem. The night was lit up as the 
 day, and was delightsome to men and beasts.... The woodland rang with voices, 
 the rocks made answer to the jubilant throng.” Francis stood before the manger, 
 “overcome with tenderness and filled with wondrous joy”; Mass was celebrated, 
 and he, in deacon's vestments, chanted the Holy Gospel in an “earnest, sweet, 
 and loud-sounding voice.” Then he preached to the people of “the birth of the 
 poor King and the little town of Bethlehem.” “Uttering the word Bethlehem in 
 the manner of a sheep bleating, he filled his mouth with the sound,” and in 
 naming the Child Jesus “he would, as it were, lick his lips, relishing with 
 happy palate and swallowing the sweetness of that word.” At length, the solemn 
 vigil ended, each one returned with joy to his own place.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-38">4-38</a><a name="Nanchor_4-38"></a> </p>
 <p>It has been suggested by Countess Martinengo﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-39">4-39</a><a name="Nanchor_4-39"></a> that this beautiful ceremony was “the crystallization 
 of haunting memories carried away by St. Francis from the real Bethlehem”; for 
 he visited the east in 1219-20, and the Greccio celebration took place in 1224. 
 St. Francis and his followers may well have helped greatly to popularize the use 
 of the <i>presepio</i>, but it can be <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a> <a name="Page_107"></a>traced back far earlier than their time. In the liturgical 
 drama known as the “Officium Pastorum,” which probably took shape in the 
 eleventh century, we find a <i>praesepe</i> behind the altar as the centre of 
 the action﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-40">4-40</a><a name="Nanchor_4-40"></a> ; but long before this something of the kind seems to 
 have been in existence in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome﻿—at one 
 time called “Beata Maria ad praesepe.” Here Pope Gregory III. (731-41) placed “a 
 golden image of the Mother of God embracing God our Saviour, in various 
 gems.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-41">4-41</a><a name="Nanchor_4-41"></a> According to Usener's views this church was founded 
 by Pope Liberius (352-66), and was intended to provide a special home for the 
 new festival of Christmas introduced by him, while an important part of the 
 early Christmas ritual there was the celebration of Mass over a “manger” in 
 which the consecrated Host was laid, as once the body of the Holy Child in the 
 crib at Bethlehem.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-42">4-42</a><a name="Nanchor_4-42"></a> Further, an eastern homily of the late fourth century 
 suggests that the preacher had before his eyes a representation of the Nativity. 
 Such material representations, Usener conjectures, may have arisen from the 
 devotions of the faithful at the supposed actual birthplace at Bethlehem, which 
 would naturally be adorned with the sacred figures of the Holy Night.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-43">4-43</a><a name="Nanchor_4-43"></a> </p>
 <p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the crib can be traced at Milan, 
 Parma, and Modena, and an Italian example carved in 1478 still exists.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-44">4-44</a><a name="Nanchor_4-44"></a> The Bavarian National Museum at Munich has a fine 
 collection of cribs of various periods and from various lands﻿—Germany, Tyrol, 
 Italy, and Sicily﻿—showing what elaborate care has been bestowed upon the 
 preparation of these models. Among them is a great erection made at Botzen in 
 the first half of the nineteenth century, and large enough to fill a fair-sized 
 room. It represents the central square of a town, with imposing buildings, 
 including a great cathedral not unlike our St. Paul's. Figures of various sizes 
 were provided to suit the perspective, and the crib itself was probably set up 
 in the porch of the church, while processions of puppets were arranged on the 
 wide open square. Another, made in Munich, shows the adoration of the shepherds 
 in a sort of ruined castle, while others, from Naples, lay the scene among 
 remains of classical temples. One Tyrolese crib has a wide landscape background 
 with a <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a> <a name="Page_108"></a>village and mountains typical of the country. The figures 
 are often numerous, and, as their makers generally dressed them in the costume 
 of their contemporaries, are sometimes exceedingly quaint. An angel with a 
 wasp-waist, in a powdered wig, a hat trimmed with big feathers, and a red velvet 
 dress with heavy gold embroidery, seems comic to us moderns, yet this is how the 
 Ursuline nuns of Innsbruck conceived the heavenly messenger. Many of the cribs 
 and figures, however, are of fine artistic quality, especially those from Naples 
 and Sicily, and to the student of costume the various types of dress are of 
 great interest.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-45">4-45</a><a name="Nanchor_4-45"></a> </p>
 <p>The use of the Christmas crib is by no means confined to churches; it is 
 common in the home in many Catholic regions, and in at least one Protestant 
 district, the Saxon Erzgebirge.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-46">4-46</a><a name="Nanchor_4-46"></a> In Germany the <i>krippe</i> is often combined with 
 the Christmas-tree; at Treves, for instance, the present writer saw a 
 magnificent tree covered with glittering lights and ornaments, and underneath it 
 the cave of the Nativity with little figures of the holy persons. Thus have 
 pagan and Christian symbols met together.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">There grew up in Germany, about the fourteenth century, 
 the extremely popular Christmas custom of “cradle-rocking,” a response to the 
 people's need of a life-like and homely presentation of Christianity. By the 
 <i>Kindelwiegen</i> the lay-folk were brought into most intimate touch with the 
 Christ Child; the crib became a cradle (<i>wiege</i>) that could be rocked, and 
 the worshippers were thus able to express in physical action their devotion to 
 the new-born Babe. The cradle-rocking seems to have been done at first by 
 priests, who impersonated the Virgin and St. Joseph, and sang over the Child a 
 duet:﻿—</p>

 the same is true of another delightful old carol, “Lasst uns das Kindlein

 Rhineland. The present writer has heard it sung, very slowly, in unison, by vast 
 congregations, and very beautiful is its mingling of solemnity, festive joy, and 
 tender sentiment:﻿—</p>

 <p>It was by appeals like this <i>Kindelwiegen</i> to the natural, homely 
 instincts of the folk that the Church gained a real hold over the masses, making 
 Christianity during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries a 
 genuinely popular religion in Germany. Dr. Alexander Tille, the best historian 
 of the German Christmas, has an interesting passage on the subject: “In the 
 dancing and jubilation around the cradle,” he writes, “the religion of the 
 Cross, however much it might in its inmost character be opposed to the nature of 
 the German people and their essential healthiness, was felt no longer as 
 something alien. It had become naturalized, but had lost in the process its very 
 core. The preparation for a life after death, which was its Alpha and Omega, had 
 passed into the background. It was not joy at the promised Redemption that 
 expressed itself in the dance around the cradle; for the German has never learnt 
 to feel himself utterly vile and sinful: it was joy at the simple fact that a 
 human being, a particular human being in peculiar circumstances, was born into 
 the world.... The Middle Ages showed in the cradle-rocking a true German and 
 most lovable childlikeness. The Christ Child was the universal little brother 
 of all children of earth, and they acted accordingly, they lulled Him to sleep, 
 they fondled and rocked Him, they danced before Him and leapt around Him <i>in 
 dulci jubilo</i>.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-51">4-51</a><a name="Nanchor_4-51"></a> There is much here that is true of the cult of the 
 Christ Child in other countries than Germany, though perhaps Dr. Tille 
 underestimates the religious feeling that is often joined to the human 
 sentiment.</p>
 <p>The fifteenth century was the great period for the <i>Kindelwiegen</i>, the 
 time when it appears to have been practised in all the churches of Germany; in 
 the sixteenth it began to seem <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a> <a name="Page_111"></a>irreverent to the stricter members of the clergy, and the 
 figure of the infant Jesus was in many places no longer rocked in the cradle but 
 enthroned on the altar.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-52">4-52</a><a name="Nanchor_4-52"></a> This usage is described by Naogeorgus (1553):﻿—</p>

 <p>The placing of a “Holy Child” above the altar at Christmas is still customary 
 in many Roman Catholic churches.</p>
 <p>Protestantism opposed the <i>Kindelwiegen</i>, on the grounds both of 
 superstition and of the disorderly proceedings that accompanied it, but it was 
 long before it was utterly extinguished even in the Lutheran churches. In 
 Catholic churches the custom did not altogether die out, though the unseemly 
 behaviour which often attended it﻿—and the growth of a pseudo-classical 
 taste﻿—caused its abolition in most places.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-54">4-54</a><a name="Nanchor_4-54"></a> </p>
 <p>At Tübingen as late as 1830 at midnight on Christmas Eve an image of the 
 Christ Child was rocked on the tower of the chief church in a small cradle 
 surrounded with lights, while the spectators below sang a cradle-song.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-55">4-55</a><a name="Nanchor_4-55"></a> According to a recent writer the “rocking” is still 
 continued in the Upper Innthal.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-56">4-56</a><a name="Nanchor_4-56"></a> In the Tyrolese cathedral city of Brixen it was once 
 performed every day between Christmas and Candlemas by the sacristan or 
 boy-acolytes. That the proceedings had a tendency to be disorderly is shown by 
 an eighteenth-century instruction to the sacristan: “Be sure to take a stick or 
 a thong of ox-hide, for the boys are often very ill-behaved.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-57">4-57</a><a name="Nanchor_4-57"></a> </p>
 <p>There are records of other curious ceremonies in German or Austrian churches. 
 At St. Peter am Windberge in Mühlkreis in Upper Austria, during the service on 
 Christmas night a life-sized wooden figure of the Holy Child was offered in <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a> <a name="Page_112"></a>a basket to the congregation; each person reverently kissed 
 it and passed it on to his neighbour. This was done as late as 1883.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-58">4-58</a><a name="Nanchor_4-58"></a> At Crimmitschau in Saxony a boy, dressed as an angel, 
 used to be let down from the roof singing Luther's “Vom Himmel hoch,” and the 
 custom was only given up when the breaking of the rope which supported the 
 singer had caused a serious accident.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-59">4-59</a><a name="Nanchor_4-59"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">It is in Italy, probably, that the cult of the Christ 
 Child is most ardently practised to-day. No people have a greater love of 
 children than the Italians, none more of that dramatic instinct which such a 
 form of worship demands. “Easter,” says Countess Martinengo-Cesaresco, “is the 
 great popular feast in the eastern Church, Christmas in the Latin﻿—especially in 
 Italy. One is the feast of the next world, and the other of this. Italians are 
 fond of this world.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-60">4-60</a><a name="Nanchor_4-60"></a> Christmas is for the poorer Italians a summing up of 
 human birthdays, an occasion for pouring out on the <i>Bambino</i> parental and 
 fraternal affection as well as religious worship.</p>
 <p>In Rome, Christmas used to be heralded by the arrival, ten days before the 
 end of Advent, of the Calabrian minstrels or <i>pifferari</i> with their sylvan 
 pipes (<i>zampogne</i>), resembling the Scottish bagpipe, but less harsh in 
 sound. These minstrels were to be seen in every street in Rome, playing their 
 wild plaintive music before the shrines of the Madonna, under the traditional 
 notion of charming away her labour-pains. Often they would stop at a carpenter's 
 shop “per politezza al messer San Giuseppe.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-61">4-61</a><a name="Nanchor_4-61"></a> Since 1870 the <i>pifferari</i> have become rare in 
 Rome, but some were seen there by an English lady quite recently. At Naples, 
 too, there are <i>zampognari</i> before Christmas, though far fewer than there 
 used to be; for one <i>lira</i> they will pipe their rustic melodies before any 
 householder's street Madonna through a whole <i>novena</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-62">4-62</a><a name="Nanchor_4-62"></a> </p>

 <p>From Hone's “Every-day Book” (London, 1826).</p></div>
 <p>In Sicily, too, men come down from the mountains nine days before Christmas 
 to sing a <i>novena</i> to a plaintive melody accompanied by cello and violin. 
 “All day long,” writes Signora Caico about Montedoro in Caltanissetta, “the 
 melancholy dirge <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a> <a name="Page_113"></a>was sung round the village, house after house, always the 
 same minor tune, the words being different every day, so that in nine days the 
 whole song was sung out.... I often looked out of the window to see them at a 
 short distance, grouped before a house, singing their stanzas, well muffled in 
 shawls, for the air is cold in spite of the bright sunshine.... The flat, white 
 houses all round, the pure sky overhead, gave an Oriental setting to the 
 scene.”</p>
 <p>Another Christmas custom in the same place was the singing of a <i>novena</i> 
 not outside but within some of the village houses before a kind of altar gaily 
 decorated and bearing at the top a waxen image of the Child Jesus. “Close to it 
 the orchestra was grouped﻿—a cello, two violins, a guitar, and a tambourine. 
 The kneeling women huddled in front of the altar. All had on their heads their 
 black <i>mantelline</i>. They began at once singing the <i>novena</i> stanzas 
 appointed for that day; the tune was primitive and very odd: the first half of 
 the stanza was quick and merry, the second half became a wailing dirge.” A full 
 translation of a long and very interesting and pathetic <i>novena</i> is given 
 by Signora Caico.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_39">39</a><a name="FNanchor_39"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-63">4-63</a><a name="Nanchor_4-63"></a> </p>
 <p>The <i>presepio</i> both in Rome and at Naples is the special Christmas 
 symbol in the home, just as the lighted tree is in Germany. In Rome the Piazza 
 Navona is the great place for the sale of little clay figures of the holy 
 persons. (Is there perchance a survival here of the <i>sigillaria</i>, the 
 little clay dolls sold in Rome at the <i>Saturnalia</i>?) These are bought in 
 the market for two <i>soldi</i> each, and the <i>presepi</i> or “Bethlehems” are 
 made at home with cardboard and moss.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-64">4-64</a><a name="Nanchor_4-64"></a> The home-made <i>presepi</i> at Naples are well 
 described by Matilde Serao; they are pasteboard models of the landscape of 
 Bethlehem﻿—a hill with the sacred cave beneath it and two or three paths leading 
 down to the grotto, a little tavern, a shepherd's hut, a few trees, sometimes a 
 stream in glittering glass. The ground is made verdant with moss, and there is 
 <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a> <a name="Page_114"></a>straw within the cave for the repose of the infant Jesus; 
 singing angels are suspended by thin wires, and the star of the Wise Men hangs 
 by an invisible thread. There is little attempt to realize the scenery of the 
 East; the Child is born and the Magi adore Him in a Campanian or Calabrian 
 setting.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-66">4-66</a><a name="Nanchor_4-66"></a> </p>
 <p>Italian churches, as well as Italian homes, have their <i>presepi</i>. 
 “Thither come the people, bearing humble gifts of chestnuts, apples, tomatoes, 
 and the like, which they place as offerings in the hands of the figures. These 
 are very often life-size. Mary is usually robed in blue satin, with crimson 
 scarf and white head-dress. Joseph stands near her dressed in the ordinary 
 working-garb. The onlookers are got up like Italian contadini. The Magi are 
 always very prominent in their grand clothes, with satin trains borne by black 
 slaves, jewelled turbans, and satin tunics all over jewels.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-67">4-67</a><a name="Nanchor_4-67"></a> </p>

 <p class="caption">THE “BAMBINO” OF ARA COELI.</p></div>
 <p>In Rome the two great centres of Christmas devotion are the churches of Santa 
 Maria Maggiore, where are preserved the relics of the cradle of Christ, and Ara 
 Coeli, the home of the most famous <i>Bambino</i> in the world. A vivid picture 
 of the scene at Santa Maria Maggiore in the early nineteenth century is given by 
 Lady Morgan. She entered the church at midnight on Christmas Eve to wait for the 
 procession of the <i>culla</i>, or cradle. “Its three ample naves, separated by 
 rows of Ionic columns of white marble, produced a splendid vista. Thousands of 
 wax tapers marked their form, and contrasted their shadows; some blazed from 
 golden candlesticks on the superb altars of the lateral chapels.... Draperies of 
 gold and crimson decked the columns, and spread their shadows from the 
 inter-columniations over the marble pavement. In the midst of this imposing 
 display of church magnificence, sauntered or reposed a population which 
 displayed the most squalid misery. The haggard natives of the mountains ... were 
 mixed with the whole mendicity of Rome.... Some of these terrific groups lay 
 stretched in heaps on the ground, congregating for warmth; and as their dark 
 eyes scowled from beneath the mantle which half hid a sheepskin dress, they had 
 the air of banditti awaiting their prey; others with their wives and children 
 knelt, half asleep, <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a> <a name="Page_115"></a>round the chapel of the <i>Santa Croce</i>.... In the 
 centre of the nave, multitudes of gay, gaudy, noisy persons, the petty 
 shopkeepers, laquais, and <i>popolaccio</i> of the city, strolled and laughed, 
 and talked loud.” About three o'clock the service began, with a choral swell, 
 blazing torches, and a crowded procession of priests of every rank and order. It 
 lasted for two hours; then began the procession to the cell where the cradle 
 lay, enshrined in a blaze of tapers and guarded by groups of devotees. Thence it 
 was borne with solemn chants to the chapel of <i>Santa Croce</i>. A musical Mass 
 followed, and the <i>culla</i> being at last deposited on the High Altar, the 
 wearied spectators issued forth just as the dome of St. Peter's caught the first 
 light of the morning.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-68">4-68</a><a name="Nanchor_4-68"></a> </p>
 <p>Still to-day the scene in the church at the five o'clock High Mass on 
 Christmas morning is extraordinarily impressive, with the crowds of poor people, 
 the countless lights at which the children gaze in open-eyed wonder, the many 
 low Masses said in the side chapels, the imposing procession and the setting of 
 the silver casket on the High Altar. The history of the relics of the 
 <i>culla</i>﻿—five long narrow pieces of wood﻿—is obscure, but it is admitted 
 even by some orthodox Roman Catholics that there is no sufficient evidence to 
 connect them with Bethlehem.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-69">4-69</a><a name="Nanchor_4-69"></a> </p>
 <p>The famous <i>Bambino</i> at the Franciscan church of Ara Coeli on the 
 citadel of Rome is “a flesh-coloured doll, tightly swathed in gold and silver 
 tissue, crowned, and sparkling with jewels,” no thing of beauty, but believed to 
 have miraculous powers. An inscription in the sacristy of the church states that 
 it was made by a devout Minorite of wood from the Mount of Olives, and given 
 flesh-colour by the interposition of God Himself. It has its own servants and 
 its own carriage in which it drives out to visit the sick. There is a strange 
 story of a theft of the wonder-working image by a woman who feigned sickness, 
 obtained permission to have the <i>Bambino</i> left with her, and then sent back 
 to the friars another image dressed in its clothes. That night the Franciscans 
 heard great ringing of bells and knockings at the church door, and found outside 
 the true <i>Bambino</i>, naked in the wind and rain. Since then it has never 
 been allowed out alone.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-70">4-70</a><a name="Nanchor_4-70"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a> <a name="Page_116"></a>All through the Christmas and Epiphany season Ara Coeli is 
 crowded with visitors to the <i>Bambino</i>. Before the <i>presepio</i>, where 
 it lies, is erected a wooden platform on which small boys and girls of all ranks 
 follow one another with little speeches﻿—“preaching” it is called﻿—in praise of 
 the infant Lord. “They say their pieces,” writes Countess Martinengo, “with an 
 infinite charm that raises half a smile and half a tear.” They have the vivid 
 dramatic gift, the extraordinary absence of self-consciousness, typical of 
 Italian children, and their “preaching” is anything but a wooden repetition of a 
 lesson learned by heart. Nor is there any irksome constraint; indeed to 
 northerners the scene in the church might seem irreverent, for the children blow 
 toy trumpets and their parents talk freely on all manner of subjects. The church 
 is approached by one hundred and twenty-four steps, making an extraordinarily 
 picturesque spectacle at this season, when they are thronged by people ascending 
 and descending, and by vendors of all sorts of Christmas prints and images. On 
 the Octave of the Epiphany there is a great procession, ending with the blessing 
 of Rome by the Holy Child. The <i>Bambino</i> is carried out to the space at the 
 top of the giddy flight of marble steps, and a priest raises it on high and 
 solemnly blesses the Eternal City.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-71">4-71</a><a name="Nanchor_4-71"></a> </p>
 <p>A glimpse of the southern Christmas may be had in London in the Italian 
 colony in and around Eyre Street Hill, off the Clerkenwell Road, a little town 
 of poor Italians set down in the midst of the metropolis. The steep, narrow Eyre 
 Street Hill, with its shops full of southern wares, is dingy enough by day, but 
 after dark on Christmas Eve it looks like a bit of Naples. The windows are gay 
 with lights and coloured festoons, there are lantern-decked sweetmeat stalls, 
 one old man has a <i>presepio</i> in his room, other people have little altars 
 or shrines with candles burning, and bright pictures of saints adorn the walls. 
 It is a strangely pathetic sight, this <i>festa</i> of the children of the 
 South, this attempt to keep an Italian Christmas amid the cold damp dreariness 
 of a London slum. The colony has its own church, San Pietro, copied from some 
 Renaissance basilica at Rome, a building half tawdry, half magnificent, which 
 transports him who enters it far away to the South. Like every Italian church, 
 it is <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a> <a name="Page_117"></a>at once the Palace of the Great King and the refuge of the 
 humblest﻿—no other church in London is quite so intimately the home of the poor. 
 Towards twelve o'clock on Christmas Eve the deep-toned bell of San Pietro booms 
 out over the colony, and the people crowd to the Midnight Mass, and pay their 
 devotions at a great <i>presepio</i> set up for the veneration of the faithful. 
 When on the Octave of the Epiphany﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_40">40</a><a name="FNanchor_40"></a> the time comes to close the crib, an impressive and 
 touching ceremony takes place. The afternoon Benediction over, the priest, with 
 the acolytes, goes to the <i>presepio</i> and returns to the chancel with the 
 <i>Bambino</i>. Holding it on his arm, he preaches in Italian on the story of 
 the Christ Child. The sermon ended, the notes of “Adeste, fideles” are heard, 
 and while the Latin words are sung the faithful kneel at the altar rails and 
 reverently kiss the Holy Babe. It is their farewell to the <i>Bambino</i> till 
 next Christmas.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">A few details may here be given about the religious 
 customs at Christmas in Spain. The Midnight Mass is there the great event of the 
 festival. Something has already been said as to its celebration in Madrid. The 
 scene at the midnight service in a small Andalusian country town is thus 
 described by an English traveller:﻿—“The church was full; the service orderly; 
 the people of all classes. There were muleteers, wrapped in their blue and white 
 checked rugs; here, Spanish gentlemen, enveloped in their graceful capas, or 
 capes ... here, again, were crowds of the commonest people,﻿—miners, 
 fruitsellers, servants, and the like,﻿—the women kneeling on the rush matting of 
 the dimly-lit church, the men standing in dark masses behind, or clustering in 
 groups round every pillar.... At last, from under the altar, the senior priest 
 ... took out the image of the Babe New-born, reverently and slowly, and held it 
 up in his hands for adoration. Instantly every one crossed himself, and fell on 
 his knees in silent worship.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-72">4-72</a><a name="Nanchor_4-72"></a> The crib is very popular in Spanish homes and is the 
 delight of children, as may be learnt from Fernan Caballero's interesting sketch 
 of Christmas Eve in Spain, “La Noche de Navidad.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-73">4-73</a><a name="Nanchor_4-73"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> <a name="Page_118"></a>In England the Christmas crib is to be found nowadays in 
 most Roman, and a few Anglican, churches. In the latter it is of course an 
 imitation, not a survival. It is, however, possible that the custom of carrying 
 dolls about in a box at Advent or Christmas time, common in some parts of 
 England in the nineteenth century, is a survival, from the Middle Ages, of 
 something like the crib. The so-called “vessel-cup” was “a box containing two 
 dolls, dressed up to represent the Virgin and the infant Christ, decorated with 
 ribbons and surrounded by flowers and apples.” The box had usually a glass lid, 
 was covered by a white napkin, and was carried from door to door by a woman.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-74">4-74</a><a name="Nanchor_4-74"></a> It was esteemed very unlucky for any household not to 
 be visited by the “Advent images” before Christmas Eve, and the bearers sang the 
 well-known carol of the “Joys of Mary.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-75">4-75</a><a name="Nanchor_4-75"></a> In Yorkshire only one image was carried about.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-76">4-76</a><a name="Nanchor_4-76"></a> At Gilmorton, Leicestershire, a friend of the present 
 writer remembers that the children used to carry round what they called a 
 “Christmas Vase,” an open box without lid in which lay three dolls side by side, 
 with oranges and sprigs of evergreen. Some people regarded these as images of 
 the Virgin, the Christ Child, and Joseph.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_41">41</a><a name="FNanchor_41"></a></p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">In this study of the feast of the Nativity as represented 
 in liturgy and ceremonial we have already come close to what may strictly be 
 called drama; in the next chapter we shall cross the border line and consider 
 the religious plays of the Middle Ages and the relics of or parallels to them 
 found in later times.</p>
