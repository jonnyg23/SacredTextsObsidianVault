 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Christmas in Ritual and Tradition</i>, by Clement A. Miles, [1912], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>
 
 <h2 align="CENTER"><a name="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
 <p>In this volume I have tried to show how Christmas is or has been kept in 
 various lands and ages, and to trace as far as possible the origin of the pagan 
 elements that have mingled with the Church's feast of the Nativity.</p>
 <p>In Part I. I have dealt with the festival on its distinctively Christian 
 side. The book has, however, been so planned that readers not interested in this 
 aspect of Christmas may pass over  <a href="crt05.htm#Chapter_II">II</a>, and proceed at once from the Introduction to  <a href="crt10.htm#Part_II">II</a>, which treats of pagan survivals.</p>
 <p>The book has been written primarily for the general reader, but I venture to 
 hope that, with all its imperfections, it may be of some use to the more serious 
 student, as a rough outline map of the field of Christmas customs, and as 
 bringing together materials hitherto scattered through a multitude of volumes in 
 various languages. There is certainly room for a comprehensive English book on 
 Christmas, taking account of the results of modern historical and folk-lore 
 research.</p>
 <p>The writer of a work of this kind necessarily owes an immense debt to the 
 labours of others. In my bibliographical notes I have done my best to 
 acknowledge the sources from which I have drawn. It is only right that I should 
 express here my special obligation, both for information and for suggestions, to 
 Mr. E. K. Chambers's “The Mediaeval Stage,” an invaluable storehouse of fact, 
 theory, and bibliographical references. I also owe much to the important 
 monographs of Dr. A. Tille, “Die Geschichte der deutschen Weihnacht” and “Yule 
 and Christmas”; to Dr. Feilberg's Danish work, “Jul,” the fullest account of 
 Christmas<a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a> <a name="Page_6"></a> customs yet written; and of course, like every student of 
 folk-lore, to Dr. Frazer's “The Golden Bough.”</p>
 <p>References to authorities will be found at the end of the volume, and are 
 indicated by small numerals in the text; notes requiring to be read in close 
 conjunction with the text are printed at the foot of the pages to which they 
 relate, and are indicated by asterisks, &amp;c.</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>[Transcriber's Note: The 'small numerals' are represented in this ebook by 
   numbers in . The footnotes appear at the end of the ebook and 
   are indicated by numbers in [square brackets].] </p></blockquote>
 <p>I have to thank Mr. Frank Sidgwick for most kindly reading my proofs and 
 portions of my MS., and for some valuable suggestions.</p>
