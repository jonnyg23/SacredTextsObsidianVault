 <p>Christmas, as we have seen, had its beginning at the middle of the fourth 
 century in Rome. The new feast was not long in finding a hymn-writer to embody 
 in immortal Latin the emotions called forth by the memory of the Nativity. 
 “Veni, redemptor gentium” is one of the earliest of Latin hymns﻿—one of the few 
 that have come down to us from the father of Church song, Ambrose, Archbishop of 
 Milan (d. 397). Great as theologian and statesman, Ambrose was great also as a 
 poet and systematizer of Church music. “Veni, redemptor gentium” is above all 
 things stately and severe, in harmony with the austere character of the zealous 
 foe of the Arian heretics, the champion of monasticism. It is the theological 
 aspect alone of Christmas, the redemption of sinful man by the mystery of the 
 Incarnation and the miracle of the Virgin Birth, that we find in St. Ambrose's 
 terse and pregnant Latin; there is no feeling for the human pathos and poetry of 
 the scene at Bethlehem﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Veni, redemptor gentium,</span><br><span class="i2">Ostende partum virginis;</span><br><span class="i2">Miretur omne

 <p>Another fine hymn often heard in English churches is of a slightly later 
 date. “Corde natus ex Parentis” (“Of the Father's love begotten”) is a cento 
 from a larger hymn by the Spanish poet Prudentius (<i>c.</i> 348-413). 
 Prudentius did not write for liturgical purposes, and it was several centuries 
 before “Corde natus” was adopted into the cycle of Latin hymns. Its elaborate 
 rhetoric is very unlike the severity of “Veni, redemptor gentium,” but again the 
 note is purely theological; the Incarnation as a world-event is its theme. It 
 sings the Birth of Him who is</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Corde natus ex Parentis</span><br><span class="i2">Ante mundi exordium,</span><br><span class="i2">Alpha et O

 sunt</span><br><span class="i4">Saeculorum saeculis.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_10">10</a><a name="FNanchor_10"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-3">2-3</a><a name="Nanchor_2-3"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Other early hymns are “A solis ortus cardine” (“From east to west, from shore 
 to shore”), by a certain Coelius Sedulius (d. <i>c.</i> 450), still sung by the 
 Roman Church at Lauds on Christmas Day, and “Jesu, redemptor omnium” (sixth 
 century), the office hymn at Christmas Vespers. Like the poems of Ambrose and 
 Prudentius, they are in classical metres, unrhymed, and based upon quantity, not 
 accent, and they have the same general character, doctrinal rather than humanly 
 tender.</p>
 <p>In the ninth and tenth centuries arose a new form of hymnody, the Prose or 
 Sequence sung after the Gradual (the anthem between the Epistle and Gospel at 
 Mass). The earliest writer of sequences was Notker, a monk of the abbey of St. 
 Gall, near <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a> <a name="Page_33"></a>the Lake of Constance. Among those that are probably his work 
 is the Christmas “Natus ante saecula Dei filius.” The most famous Nativity 
 sequence, however, is the “Laetabundus, exsultet fidelis chorus” of St. Bernard 
 of Clairvaux (d. 1153), once sung all over Europe, and especially popular in 
 England and France. Here are its opening verses:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Laetabundus,</span><br><span class="i2">Exsultet fidelis chorus;</span><br><span class="i4">Alleluia!</span><br><span class="i2">Regem regum</span><br><span class="i2">Intactae profudit thorus;</span><br><span class="i4">Res 
 miranda!</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Angelus consilii</span><br><span class="i2">Natus 
 est de Virgine,</span><br><span class="i4">Sol de stella!</span><br><span class="i2">Sol occasum nesciens,</span><br><span class="i2">Stella semper 
 rutilans,</span><br><span class="i4">Semper clara.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_11">11</a><a name="FNanchor_11"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-4">2-4</a><a name="Nanchor_2-4"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>The “Laetabundus” is in rhymed stanzas; in this it differs from most early 
 proses. The writing of rhymed sequences, however, became common through the 
 example of the Parisian monk, Adam of St. Victor, in the second half of the 
 twelfth century. He adopted an entirely new style of versification and music, 
 derived from popular songs; and he and his successors in <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a> <a name="Page_34"></a>the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries wrote various proses 
 for the Christmas festival.</p>
 <p>If we consider the Latin Christmas hymns from the fourth century to the 
 thirteenth, we shall find that however much they differ in form, they have one 
 common characteristic: they are essentially theological﻿—dwelling on the 
 Incarnation and the Nativity as part of the process of man's redemption﻿—rather 
 than realistic. There is little attempt to imagine the scene in the stable at 
 Bethlehem, little interest in the Child as a child, little sense of the human 
 pathos of the Nativity. The explanation is, I think, very simple, and it lights 
 up the whole observance of Christmas as a Church festival in the centuries we 
 are considering: <i>this poetry is the poetry of monks, or of men imbued with 
 the monastic spirit</i>.</p>
 <p>The two centuries following the institution of Christmas saw the break-up of 
 the Roman Empire in the west, and the incursions of barbarians threatening the 
 very existence of the Christian civilization that had conquered classic 
 paganism. It was by her army of monks that the Church tamed and Christianized 
 the barbarians, and both religion and culture till the middle of the twelfth 
 century were predominantly monastic. “In writing of any eminently religious man 
 of this period” [the eleventh century], says Dean Church, “it must be taken 
 almost as a matter of course that he was a monk.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-5">2-5</a><a name="Nanchor_2-5"></a> And a monastery was not the place for human feeling 
 about Christmas; the monk was﻿—at any rate in ideal﻿—cut off from the world; not 
 for him were the joys of parenthood or tender feelings for a new-born child. To 
 the monk the world was, at least in theory, the vale of misery; birth and 
 generation were, one may almost say, tolerated as necessary evils among lay folk 
 unable to rise to the heights of abstinence and renunciation; one can hardly 
 imagine a true early Benedictine filled with “joy that a man is born into the 
 world.” The Nativity was an infinitely important event, to be celebrated with a 
 chastened, unearthly joy, but not, as it became for the later Middle Ages and 
 the Renaissance, a matter upon which human affection might lavish itself, which 
 imagination might deck with vivid concrete detail. In the later Christmas <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a> <a name="Page_35"></a>the pagan and the Christian spirit, or delight in earthly 
 things and joy in the invisible, seem to meet and mingle; to the true monk of 
 the Dark and Early Middle Ages they were incompatible.</p>
 <p>What of the people, the great world outside the monasteries? Can we imagine 
 that Christmas, on its Christian side, had a deep meaning for them? For the 
 first ten centuries, to quote Dean Church again, Christianity “can hardly be 
 said to have leavened society at all.... It acted upon it doubtless with 
 enormous power; but it was as an extraneous and foreign agent, which destroys 
 and shapes, but does not mingle or renew.... Society was a long time unlearning 
 heathenism; it has not done so yet; but it had hardly begun, at any rate it was 
 only just beginning, to imagine the possibility of such a thing in the eleventh 
 century.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-6">2-6</a><a name="Nanchor_2-6"></a> </p>
 <p>“The practical religion of the illiterate,” says another ecclesiastical 
 historian, Dr. W. R. W. Stephens, “was in many respects merely a survival of the 
 old paganism thinly disguised. There was a prevalent belief in witchcraft, 
 magic, sortilegy, spells, charms, talismans, which mixed itself up in strange 
 ways with Christian ideas and Christian worship.... Fear, the note of 
 superstition, rather than love, which is the characteristic of a rational faith, 
 was conspicuous in much of the popular religion. The world was haunted by 
 demons, hobgoblins, malignant spirits of divers kinds, whose baneful influence 
 must be averted by charms or offerings.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-7">2-7</a><a name="Nanchor_2-7"></a> </p>
 <p>The writings of ecclesiastics, the decrees of councils and synods, from the 
 fourth century to the eleventh, abound in condemnations of pagan practices at 
 the turn of the year. It is in these customs, and in secular mirth and revelry, 
 not in Christian poetry, that we must seek for the expression of early lay 
 feeling about Christmas. It was a feast of material good things, a time for the 
 fulfilment of traditional heathen usages, rather than a joyous celebration of 
 the Saviour's birth. No doubt it was observed by due attendance at church, but 
 the services in a tongue not understanded of the people cannot have been very 
 full of meaning to them, and we can imagine <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a> <a name="Page_36"></a>their Christmas church-going as rather a duty inspired by 
 fear than an expression of devout rejoicing. It is noteworthy that the earliest 
 of vernacular Christmas carols known to us, the early thirteenth-century 
 Anglo-Norman “Seignors, ore entendez à nus,” is a song not of religion but of 
 revelry. Its last verse is typical:</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Seignors, jo vus di par Noël,</span><br><span class="i2">E par li sires de cest hostel,</span><br><span class="i6">Car bevez 
 ben;</span><br><span class="i2">E jo primes beverai le men,</span><br><span class="i2">E pois aprèz chescon le soen,</span><br><span class="i4">Par mon 
 conseil;</span><br><span class="i2">Si jo vus di trestoz, 
 Wesseyl!</span><br><span class="i2">Dehaiz eit qui ne dirra, Drincheyl!”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_12">12</a><a name="FNanchor_12"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-8">2-8</a><a name="Nanchor_2-8"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Not till the close of the thirteenth century do we meet with any vernacular 
 Christmas poetry of importance. The verses of the <i>troubadours</i> and 
 <i>trouvères</i> of twelfth-century France had little to do with Christianity; 
 their songs were mostly of earthly and illicit love. The German Minnesingers of 
 the thirteenth century were indeed pious, but their devout lays were addressed 
 to the Virgin as Queen of Heaven, the ideal of womanhood, holding in glory the 
 Divine Child in her arms, rather than to the Babe and His Mother in the great 
 humility of Bethlehem.</p>
 <p>The first real outburst of Christmas joy in a popular tongue is found in 
 Italy, in the poems of that strange “minstrel of the Lord,” the Franciscan 
 Jacopone da Todi (b. 1228, d. 1306). <i>Franciscan</i>, in that name we have an 
 indication of the change in religious feeling that came over the western world, 
 and <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a> <a name="Page_37"></a>especially Italy, in the thirteenth century.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-9">2-9</a><a name="Nanchor_2-9"></a> For the twenty all-too-short years of St. Francis's 
 apostolate have passed, and a new attitude towards God and man and the world has 
 become possible. Not that the change was due solely to St. Francis; he was 
 rather the supreme embodiment of the ideals and tendencies of his day than their 
 actual creator; but he was the spark that kindled a mighty flame. In him we 
 reach so important a turning-point in the history of Christmas that we must 
 linger awhile at his side.</p>
 <p>Early Franciscanism meant above all the democratizing, the humanizing of 
 Christianity; with it begins that “carol spirit” which is the most winning part 
 of the Christian Christmas, the spirit which, while not forgetting the divine 
 side of the Nativity, yet delights in its simple humanity, the spirit that links 
 the Incarnation to the common life of the people, that brings human tenderness 
 into religion. The faithful no longer contemplate merely a theological mystery, 
 they are moved by affectionate devotion to the Babe of Bethlehem, realized as an 
 actual living child, God indeed, yet feeling the cold of winter, the roughness 
 of the manger bed.</p>
 <p>St. Francis, it must be remembered, was not a man of high birth, but the son 
 of a silk merchant, and his appeal was made chiefly to the traders and skilled 
 workmen of the cities, who, in his day, were rising to importance, coming, in 
 modern Socialist terms, to class-consciousness. The monks, although boys of low 
 birth were sometimes admitted into the cloister, were in sympathy one with the 
 upper classes, and monastic religion and culture were essentially aristocratic. 
 The rise of the Franciscans meant the bringing home of Christianity to masses of 
 town-workers, homely people, who needed a religion full of vivid humanity, and 
 whom the pathetic story of the Nativity would peculiarly touch.</p>
 <p>Love to man, the sense of human brotherhood﻿—that was the great thing which 
 St. Francis brought home to his age. The message, certainly, was not new, but he 
 realized it with infectious intensity. The second great commandment, “Thou shall 
 love thy neighbour as thyself,” had not indeed been forgotten by <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a> <a name="Page_38"></a>mediaeval Christianity; the common life of monasticism was an 
 attempt to fulfil it; yet for the monk love to man was often rather a duty than 
 a passion. But to St. Francis love was very life; he loved not by duty but by an 
 inner compulsion, and his burning love of God and man found its centre in the 
 God-man, Christ Jesus. For no saint, perhaps, has the earthly life of Christ 
 been the object of such passionate devotion as for St. Francis; the Stigmata 
 were the awful, yet, to his contemporaries, glorious fruit of his meditations on 
 the Passion; and of the ecstasy with which he kept his Christmas at Greccio we 
 shall read when we come to consider the <i>Presepio</i>. He had a peculiar 
 affection for the festival of the Holy Child; “the Child Jesus,” says Thomas of 
 Celano, “had been given over to forgetfulness in the hearts of many in whom, by 
 the working of His grace, He was raised up again through His servant 
 Francis.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-10">2-10</a><a name="Nanchor_2-10"></a> </p>
 <p>To the Early Middle Ages Christ was the awful Judge, the <i>Rex tremendae 
 majestatis</i>, though also the divine bringer of salvation from sin and eternal 
 punishment, and, to the mystic, the Bridegroom of the Soul. To Francis He was 
 the little brother of all mankind as well. It was a new human joy that came into 
 religion with him. His essentially artistic nature was the first to realize the 
 full poetry of Christmas﻿—the coming of infinity into extremest limitation, the 
 Highest made the lowliest, the King of all kings a poor infant. He had, in a 
 supreme degree, the mingled reverence and tenderness that inspire the best 
 carols.</p>
 <p>Though no Christmas verses by St. Francis have come down to us, there is a 
 beautiful “psalm” for Christmas Day at Vespers, composed by him partly from 
 passages of Scripture. A portion of Father Paschal Robinson's translation may be 
 quoted:﻿—</p>

 <p>It is in the poetry of Jacopone da Todi, born shortly after the death of St. 
 Francis, that the Franciscan Christmas spirit finds its most intense expression. 
 A wild, wandering ascetic, an impassioned poet, and a soaring mystic, Jacopone 
 is one of the greatest of Christian singers, unpolished as his verses are. Noble 
 by birth, he made himself utterly as the common people for whom he piped his 
 rustic notes. “Dio fatto piccino” (“God made a little thing”) is the keynote of 
 his music; the Christ Child is for him “our sweet little brother”; with tender 
 affection he rejoices in endearing diminutives﻿—“Bambolino,” “Piccolino,” 
 “Jesulino.” He sings of the Nativity with extraordinary realism.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_13">13</a><a name="FNanchor_13"></a> Here, in words, is a picture of the Madonna and her 
 Child that might well have inspired an early Tuscan artist:﻿—</p>

 <p>But there is an intense sense of the divine, as well as the human, in the 
 Holy Babe; no one has felt more vividly the paradox of the Incarnation:﻿—</p>

 <p>In the fourteenth century we find a blossoming forth of Christmas poetry in 
 another land, Germany.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-16">2-16</a><a name="Nanchor_2-16"></a> There are indeed Christmas and Epiphany passages in a 
 poetical Life of Christ by Otfrid of Weissenburg in the ninth century, and a 
 twelfth-century poem by Spervogel, “Er ist gewaltic unde starc,” opens with a 
 mention of Christmas, but these are of little importance for us. The fourteenth 
 century shows the first real outburst, and that is traceable, in part at least, 
 to the mystical movement in the Rhineland caused by the preaching of the great 
 Dominican, Eckhart of Strasburg, and his followers. It was a movement towards 
 inward piety as distinguished from, though not excluding, external observances, 
 which made its way largely by sermons listened to by great congregations in the 
 towns. Its impulse came not from the monasteries proper, but from the convents 
 of Dominican friars, and it was for Germany in the fourteenth century something 
 like what Franciscanism had been for Italy in the thirteenth. One of the central 
 doctrines of the school <a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a> <a name="Page_43"></a>was that of the Divine Birth in the soul of the believer; 
 according to Eckhart the soul comes into immediate union with God by “bringing 
 forth the Son” within itself; the historic Christ is the symbol of the divine 
 humanity to which the soul should rise: “when the soul bringeth forth the Son,” 
 he says, “it is happier than Mary.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-17">2-17</a><a name="Nanchor_2-17"></a> Several Christmas sermons by Eckhart have been 
 preserved; one of them ends with the prayer, “To this Birth may that God, who 
 to-day is new born as man, bring us, that we, poor children of earth, may be 
 born in Him as God; to this may He bring us eternally! Amen.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-18">2-18</a><a name="Nanchor_2-18"></a> With this profound doctrine of the Divine Birth, it 
 was natural that the German mystics should enter deeply into the festival of 
 Christmas, and one of the earliest of German Christmas carols, “Es komt ein 
 schif geladen,” is the work of Eckhart's disciple, John Tauler (d. 1361). It is 
 perhaps an adaptation of a secular song:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“A ship comes sailing onwards</span><br><span class="i3">With a precious freight on board;</span><br><span class="i2">It bears the 
 only Son of God,</span><br><span class="i3">It bears the Eternal 
 Word.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>The doctrine of the mystics, “Die in order to live,” fills the last 
 verses:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Whoe'er would hope in 
 gladness</span><br><span class="i3">To kiss this Holy Child,</span><br><span class="i2">Must suffer many a pain and woe,</span><br><span class="i3">Patient like 
 Him and mild;</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Must die with Him to evil</span><br><span class="i3">And rise to righteousness,</span><br><span class="i2">That so with Christ 
 he too may share</span><br><span class="i3">Eternal life and bliss.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-19">2-19</a><a name="Nanchor_2-19"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>To the fourteenth century may perhaps belong an allegorical carol still sung 
 in both Catholic and Protestant Germany:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Es ist ein Ros entsprungen</span><br><span class="i2">Aus einer Wurzel zart,<a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a> <a name="Page_44"></a></span><br><span class="i2">Als uns die Alten

 <p>In a fourteenth-century Life of the mystic Heinrich Suso it is told how one 
 day angels came to him to comfort him in his sufferings, how they took him by 
 the hand and led him to dance, while one began a glad song of the child Jesus, 
 “In dulci jubilo.” To the fourteenth century, then, dates back that most 
 delightful of German carols, with its interwoven lines of Latin. I may quote the 
 fine Scots translation in the “Godlie and Spirituall Sangis” of 1567:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“<i>In dulci Jubilo</i>, Now lat us sing with 
 myrth and jo</span><br><span class="i2">Our hartis consolatioun lyis <i>in

 thair.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-21">2-21</a><a name="Nanchor_2-21"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>The music of “In dulci jubilo”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_19">19</a><a name="FNanchor_19"></a> has, with all its religious feeling, something of the 
 nature of a dance, and unites in a strange fashion solemnity, playfulness, and 
 ecstatic delight. No other air, perhaps, shows so perfectly the reverent gaiety 
 of the carol spirit.</p>
 <p>The fifteenth century produced a realistic type of German carol. Here is the 
 beginning of one such:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Da Jesu Krist geboren wart,</span><br><span class="i2">do was es kalt;</span><br><span class="i2">in ain klaines 
 kripplein</span><br><span class="i2">er geleget wart.</span><br><span class="i2">Da 
 stunt ain esel und ain rint,</span><br><span class="i2">die atmizten über das 
 hailig kint</span><br><span class="i2">gar unverborgen.</span><br><span class="i2">Der ain raines herze hat, der darf nit sorgen.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_20">20</a><a name="FNanchor_20"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-22">2-22</a><a name="Nanchor_2-22"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>It goes on to tell in naïve language the story of the wanderings of the Holy 
 Family during the Flight into Egypt.</p>
 <p>This carol type lasted, and continued to develop, in Austria and the Catholic 
 parts of Germany through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, 
 and even in the nineteenth. In Carinthia in the early nineteenth century, almost 
 every parish had its local poet, who added new songs to the old treasury.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-23">2-23</a><a name="Nanchor_2-23"></a> Particularly popular were the <i>Hirtenlieder</i> or 
 shepherd songs, in which the peasant worshippers joined themselves to the 
 shepherds of Bethlehem, and sought to share their devout <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a> <a name="Page_46"></a>emotions. Often these carols are of the most rustic character 
 and in the broadest dialect. They breathe forth a great kindliness and 
 homeliness, and one could fill pages with quotations. Two more short extracts 
 must, however, suffice to show their quality.</p>
 <p>How warm and hearty is their feeling for the Child:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Du herzliabste Muater, gib Acht auf dös 
 Kind,</span><br><span class="i2">Es is ja gar frostig, thuas einfatschen

 <p>And what fatherly affection is here:﻿—</p>

 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a> <a name="Page_47"></a>We have been following on German ground a mediaeval tradition 
 that has continued unbroken down to modern days; but we must now take a leap 
 backward in time, and consider the beginnings of the Christmas carol in 
 England.</p>
 <p>Not till the fifteenth century is there any outburst of Christmas poetry in 
 English, though other forms of religious lyrics were produced in considerable 
 numbers in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. When the carols come 
 at last, they appear in the least likely of all places, at the end of a 
 versifying of the whole duty of man, by John Awdlay, a blind chaplain of 
 Haghmon, in Shropshire. In red letters he writes:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“I pray you, sirus, boothe moore and 
 lase,</span><br><span class="i2">Sing these caroles in 
 Cristëmas,”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>and then follows a collection of twenty-five songs, some of which are genuine 
 Christmas carols, as one now understands the word.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-26">2-26</a><a name="Nanchor_2-26"></a> </p>
 <p>A carol, in the modern English sense, may perhaps be defined as a religious 
 song, less formal and solemn than the ordinary Church hymn﻿—an expression of 
 popular and often naïve devotional feeling, a thing intended to be sung outside 
 rather than within church walls. There still linger about the word some echoes 
 of its original meaning, for “carol” had at first a secular or even pagan 
 significance: in twelfth-century France it was used to describe the amorous 
 song-dance which hailed the coming of spring; in Italian it meant a ring- or 
 song-dance; while by English writers from the thirteenth to the sixteenth 
 century it was used chiefly of singing joined with dancing, and had no necessary 
 connection with religion. Much as the mediaeval Church, with its ascetic 
 tendencies, disliked religious dancing, it could not always suppress it; and in 
 Germany, as we shall see, there was choral dancing at Christmas round the cradle 
 of the Christ Child. Whether Christmas carols were ever danced to in England <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 48</font></a> <a name="Page_48"></a>is doubtful; many of the old airs and words have, however, a 
 glee and playfulness as of human nature following its natural instincts of joy 
 even in the celebration of the most sacred mysteries. It is probable that some 
 of the carols are religious parodies of love-songs, written for the melodies of 
 the originals, and many seem by their structure to be indirectly derived from 
 the choral dances of farm folk, a notable feature being their burden or refrain, 
 a survival of the common outcry of the dancers as they leaped around.</p>
 <p>Awdlay's carols are perhaps meant to be sung by “wassailing neighbours, who 
 make their rounds at Christmastide to drink a cup and take a gift, and bring 
 good fortune upon the house”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-27">2-27</a><a name="Nanchor_2-27"></a> ﻿—predecessors of those carol-singers of rural 
 England in the nineteenth century, whom Mr. Hardy depicts so delightfully in 
 “Under the Greenwood Tree.” Carol-singing by a band of men who go from house to 
 house is probably a Christianization of such heathen processions as we shall 
 meet in less altered forms in Part II.</p>
 <p>It must not be supposed that the carols Awdlay gives are his own work; and 
 their exact date it is impossible to determine. Part of his book was composed in 
 1426, but one at least of the carols was probably written in the last half of 
 the fourteenth century. They seem indeed to be the later blossomings of the 
 great springtime of English literature, the period which produced Chaucer and 
 Langland, an innumerable company of minstrels and ballad-makers, and the 
 mystical poet, Richard Rolle of Hampole.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_23">23</a><a name="FNanchor_23"></a></p>
 <p>Through the fifteenth century and the first half of the sixteenth, the 
 flowering continued; and something like two hundred carols of this period are 
 known. It is impossible to attempt here anything like representative quotation; 
 I can only sketch in <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a> <a name="Page_49"></a>roughest outline the main characteristics of English carol 
 literature, and refer the reader for examples to Miss Edith Rickert's 
 comprehensive collection, “Ancient English Carols, MCCCC-MDCC,” or to the 
 smaller but fine selection in Messrs. E. K. Chambers and F. Sidgwick's “Early 
 English Lyrics.” Many may have been the work of <i>goliards</i> or wandering 
 scholars, and a common feature is the interweaving of Latin with English 
 words.</p>
 <p>Some, like the exquisite “I sing of a maiden that is makeles,”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-29">2-29</a><a name="Nanchor_2-29"></a> are rather songs to or about the Virgin than strictly 
 Christmas carols; the Annunciation rather than the Nativity is their theme. 
 Others again tell the whole story of Christ's life. The feudal idea is strong in 
 such lines as these:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Mary is quene of allë thinge,</span><br><span class="i2">And her sone a lovely kinge.</span><br><span class="i2">God graunt us 
 allë good endinge!</span><br><span class="i5"><i>Regnat dei gracia</i>.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-30">2-30</a><a name="Nanchor_2-30"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>On the whole, in spite of some mystical exceptions, the mediaeval English 
 carol is somewhat external in its religion; there is little deep individual 
 feeling; the caroller sings as a member of the human race, whose curse is done 
 away, whose nature is exalted by the Incarnation, rather than as one whose soul 
 is athirst for God:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Now man is brighter than the 
 sonne;</span><br><span class="i2">Now man in heven an hie shall 
 wonne;</span><br><span class="i2">Blessëd be God this game is 
 begonne</span><br><span class="i3">And his moder emperesse of helle.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-31">2-31</a><a name="Nanchor_2-31"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Salvation is rather an objective external thing than an inward and spiritual 
 process. A man has but to pray devoutly to the dear Mother and Child, and they 
 will bring him to the heavenly court. It is not so much personal sin as an evil 
 influence in humanity, that is cured by the great event of Christmas:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“It was dark, it was dim,</span><br><span class="i2">For men that levëd in gret sin;</span><br><span class="i2">Lucifer was 
 all within,</span><br><span class="i3">Till on the Cristmes day.<a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a> <a name="Page_50"></a></span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">There was weping, there was wo,</span><br><span class="i2">For every man to hell gan go.</span><br><span class="i2">It was litel 
 mery tho,</span><br><span class="i3">Till on the Cristmes day.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-32">2-32</a><a name="Nanchor_2-32"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>But now that Christ is born, and man redeemed, one may be blithe 
 indeed:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Jhesus is that childës name,</span><br><span class="i2">Maide and moder is his dame,</span><br><span class="i2">And so oure sorow 
 is turned to game.</span><br><span class="i5"><i>Gloria tibi

 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">*       *       *       *       *</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Now sitte we downe upon our

 <p>Sometimes the religious spirit almost vanishes, and the carol becomes little 
 more than a gay pastoral song:﻿—</p>
