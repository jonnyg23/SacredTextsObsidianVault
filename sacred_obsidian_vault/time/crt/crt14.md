 <p>The peoples of Europe have various centres for their Christmas rejoicing. In 
 Spain and Italy the crib is often the focus of the festival in the home as well 
 as the church. In England﻿—after the old tradition﻿—, in rural France, and among 
 the southern Slavs, the centre is the great log solemnly brought in and kindled 
 on the hearth, while in Germany, one need hardly say, the light-laden tree is 
 the supreme symbol of Christmas. The crib has already been treated in our First 
 Part, the Yule log and the Christmas-tree will be considered in this chapter and 
 the next.</p>
 <p>The log placed on the fire on the Vigil of the Nativity no longer forms an 
 important part of the English Christmas. Yet within the memory of many it was a 
 very essential element in the celebration of the festival, not merely as giving 
 out welcome warmth in the midwinter cold, but as possessing occult, magical 
 properties. In some remote corners of England it probably lingers yet. We shall 
 return to the traditional English Yule log after a study of some Continental 
 customs of the same kind.</p>
 <p>First, we may travel to a part of eastern Europe where the log ceremonies are 
 found in their most elaborate form. Among the Serbs and Croats on Christmas Eve 
 two or three young oaks are felled for every house, and, as twilight comes on, 
 are brought in and laid on the fire. (Sometimes there is one for each male <a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a> <a name="Page_252"></a>member of the family, but one large log is the centre of 
 the ritual.) The felling takes place in some districts before sunrise, corn 
 being thrown upon the trees with the words, “Good morning, Christmas!” At Risano 
 and other places in Lower Dalmatia the women and girls wind red silk and gold 
 wire round the oak trunks, and adorn them with leaves and flowers. While they 
 are being carried into the house lighted tapers are held on either side of the 
 door. As the house-father crosses the threshold in the twilight with the first 
 log, corn﻿—or in some places wine﻿—is thrown over him by one of the family. The 
 log or <i>badnjak</i> is then placed on the fire. At Ragusa the house-father 
 sprinkles corn and wine upon the <i>badnjak</i>, saying, as the flame shoots up, 
 “Goodly be thy birth!” In the mountains above Risano he not only pours corn and 
 wine but afterwards takes a bowl of corn, an orange, and a ploughshare, and 
 places them on the upper end of the log in order that the corn may grow well and 
 the beasts be healthy during the year. In Montenegro, instead of throwing corn, 
 he more usually breaks a piece of unleavened bread, places it upon the log, and 
 pours over it a libation of wine.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-1">11-1</a><a name="Nanchor_11-1"></a> </p>
 <p>The first visit on Christmas Day is considered important﻿—we may compare this 
 with “first-footing” in the British Isles on January 1﻿—and in order that 
 the right sort of person may come, some one is specially chosen to be the 
 so-called <i>polaznik</i>. No outsider but this <i>polaznik</i> may enter a 
 house on Christmas Day, where the rites are strictly observed. He appears in the 
 early morning, carries corn in his glove and shakes it out before the threshold 
 with the words, “Christ is born,” whereupon some member of the household 
 sprinkles him with corn in return, answering, “He is born indeed.” Afterwards 
 the <i>polaznik</i> goes to the fire and makes sparks fly from the remains of 
 the <i>badnjak</i>, at the same time uttering a wish for the good luck of the 
 house-father and his household and farm. Money and sometimes an orange are then 
 placed on the <i>badnjak</i>. It is not allowed to burn quite away; the last 
 remains of the fire are extinguished and the embers are laid between the 
 branches of young fruit-trees to promote their growth.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-2">11-2</a><a name="Nanchor_11-2"></a> </p>
 <p>How shall we interpret these practices? Mannhardt regards the log as an 
 embodiment of the vegetation-spirit, and its burning <a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a> <a name="Page_253"></a>as an efficacious symbol of sunshine, meant to secure the 
 genial vitalizing influence of the sun during the coming year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-3">11-3</a><a name="Nanchor_11-3"></a> It is, however, possible to connect it with a 
 different circle of ideas and to see in its burning the solemn annual rekindling 
 of the sacred hearth-fire, the centre of the family life and the dwelling-place 
 of the ancestors. Primitive peoples in many parts of the world are accustomed to 
 associate fire with human generation,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-4">11-4</a><a name="Nanchor_11-4"></a> and it is a general belief among Aryan and other 
 peoples that ancestral spirits have their seat in the hearth. In Russia, for 
 instance, “in the Nijegorod Government it is still forbidden to break up the 
 smouldering faggots in a stove, because to do so might cause the ancestors to 
 fall through into hell. And when a Russian family moves from one house to 
 another, the fire is conveyed to the new one, where it is received with the 
 words, Welcome, grandfather, to the new home!”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-5">11-5</a><a name="Nanchor_11-5"></a> </p>
 <p>Sir Arthur Evans in three articles in <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i> for 1881﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-6">11-6</a><a name="Nanchor_11-6"></a> gave a minute account of the Christmas customs of the 
 Serbian highlanders above Risano, who practise the log-rites with elaborate 
 ceremonial, and explained them as connected in one way or other with 
 ancestor-worship, though the people themselves attach a Christian meaning to 
 many of them. He pointed to the following facts as showing that the Serbian 
 Christmas is at bottom a feast of the dead:﻿—(1) It is said on Christmas Eve, 
 “To-night Earth is blended with Paradise” [<i>Raj</i>, the abode of the dead 
 among the heathen Slavs]. (2) There is talk of unchristened folk beneath the 
 threshold wailing “for a wax-light and offerings to be brought them; when that 
 is done they lie still enough”﻿—here there may be a modified survival of the 
 idea that ancestral spirits dwell beneath the doorway. (3) The food must on no 
 account be cleared away after the Christmas meal, but is left for three days, 
 apparently for the house-spirits. (4) Blessings are invoked upon the “Absent 
 Ones,” which seems to mean the departed, and (5) a toast is drunk and a 
 bread-cake broken in memory of “the Patron Namegiver of all house-fathers,” 
 ostensibly Christ but perhaps originally the founder of the family. Some of 
 these customs resemble those we have noted on All Souls Eve and﻿—in 
 Scandinavia﻿—on Christmas Eve; other parallels we shall meet <a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 254</font></a> <a name="Page_254"></a>with later. Among the Slav races the old organization of 
 the family under an elective house-elder and holding things in common has been 
 faithfully preserved, and we might expect to find among the remote Serbian 
 highlanders specially clear traces of the old religion of the hearth. One 
 remarkable point noted by Sir Arthur Evans was that in the Crivoscian cottage 
 where he stayed the fire-irons, the table, and the stools were removed to an 
 obscure corner before the logs were brought in and the Christmas rites began﻿—an 
 indication apparently of the extreme antiquity of the celebration, as dating 
 from a time when such implements were unknown.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-7">11-7</a><a name="Nanchor_11-7"></a> </p>
 <p>If we take the view that ancestral spirits are the centre of the 
 <i>badnjak</i> observances, we may regard the libations upon the fire as 
 intended for their benefit. On the sun and vegetation hypothesis, however, the 
 libations would be meant to secure, by homoeopathic magic, that sunshine should 
 alternate with the rain necessary for the welfare of plants.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_99">99</a><a name="FNanchor_99"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-8">11-8</a><a name="Nanchor_11-8"></a> The fertilizing powers possessed by the sparks and 
 ashes of the Christmas log appear frequently in folk-lore, and may be explained 
 either by the connection of fire with human generation already noted, or, on the 
 other theory, by the burning log being a sort of sacrament of sunshine. It is 
 not perhaps necessary to exclude the idea of the log's connection with the 
 vegetation-spirit even on the ancestral cult hypothesis, for the tree which 
 furnished the fuel may have been regarded as the source of the life of the 
 race.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-9">11-9</a><a name="Nanchor_11-9"></a> The Serbian rites certainly suggest very strongly some 
 sort of veneration for the log itself as well as for the fire that it feeds.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">We may now return to western Europe. In France the 
 Christmas log or <i>souche de Noël</i> is common in the less modernized places, 
 particularly in the south. In Dauphiné it is called <i>chalendal</i>, <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a> <a name="Page_255"></a>in Provence <i>calignaou</i> (from <i>Kalendae</i>, of 
 course) or <i>tréfoir</i>, in Orne <i>tréfouet</i>. On Christmas Eve in Provence 
 the whole family goes solemnly out to bring in the log. A carol meanwhile is 
 sung praying for blessings on the house, that the women may bear children, the 
 nanny-goats kids, and the ewes lambs, that corn and flour may abound, and the 
 cask be full of wine. Then the youngest child in the family pours wine on the 
 log in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The log is then thrown upon 
 the fire, and the charcoal is kept all the year and used as a remedy for various 
 ills.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-11">11-11</a><a name="Nanchor_11-11"></a> </p>
 <p>Another account is given in his Memoirs by Frédéric Mistral, the Provençal 
 poet. On Christmas Eve everyone, he says, speaking of his boyhood, sallied forth 
 to fetch the Yule log, which had to be cut from a fruit-tree:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“Walking in line we bore it home, headed by the oldest at one end, and I, 
   the last born, bringing up the rear. Three times we made the tour of the 
   kitchen, then, arrived at the flagstones of the hearth, my father solemnly 
   poured over the log a glass of wine, with the dedicatory words:</p>
   <p>Joy, joy. May God shower joy upon us, my dear children. Christmas brings 
   us all good things. God give us grace to see the New Year, and if we do not 
   increase in numbers may we at all events not decrease.</p>
   <p>In chorus we responded:</p>
   <p>Joy, joy, joy! and lifted the log on the fire dogs. Then as the first 
   flame leapt up my father would cross himself, saying, Burn the log, O fire, 
   and with that we all sat down to the table.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-12">11-12</a><a name="Nanchor_11-12"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>In some places the <i>tréfoir</i> or <i>tison de Noël</i> is burnt every 
 evening during the Thirteen Nights. If put under the bed its charcoal protects 
 the house all the year round from lightning; contact with it preserves people 
 from chilblains and animals from various diseases; mixed with fodder it makes 
 cows calve; its brands thrown into the soil keep the corn healthy. In Périgord 
 the portion which has not been burnt is used to form part of a plough, and is 
 believed to make the seed prosper; women also keep some fragments until Epiphany 
 that their poultry may thrive.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-13">11-13</a><a name="Nanchor_11-13"></a> In <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a> <a name="Page_256"></a>Brittany the <i>tison</i> is a protection against lightning 
 and its ashes are put in wells to keep the water good.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-14">11-14</a><a name="Nanchor_11-14"></a> </p>
 <p>In northern Italy also the <i>ceppo</i> or log is (or was) known﻿—the 
 Piedmontese call it <i>suc</i>﻿—and in Tuscany Christmas is called after it 
 <i>Festa di Ceppo</i>. In the Val di Chiana on Christmas Eve the family gathers, 
 a great log is set on the fire, the children are blindfolded and have to beat it 
 with tongs, and an <i>Ave Maria del Ceppo</i> is sung.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-15">11-15</a><a name="Nanchor_11-15"></a> Under the name in Lombardy of <i>zocco</i>, in 
 Tuscany of <i>ciocco</i>, <i>di Natale</i>, the Yule log was in olden times 
 common in Italian cities; the custom can there be traced back to the eleventh 
 century. A little book probably printed in Milan at the end of the fifteenth 
 century gives minute particulars of the ritual observed, and we learn that on 
 Christmas Eve the father, or the head of the household, used to call all the 
 family together and with great devotion, in the name of the Holy Trinity, take 
 the log and place it on the fire. Juniper was put under it, and on the top money 
 was placed, afterwards to be given to the servants. Wine in abundance was poured 
 three times on the fire when the head of the house had drunk and given drink to 
 all present. It was an old Italian custom to preserve the ashes of the 
 <i>zocco</i> as a protection against hail. A modern superstition is to keep some 
 splinters of the wood and burn them in the fires made for the benefit of 
 silkworms; so burnt, they are supposed to keep ills away from the creatures.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-16">11-16</a><a name="Nanchor_11-16"></a> </p>
 <p>In many parts of Germany Yule log customs can be traced. In Hesse and 
 Westphalia, for instance, it was the custom on Christmas Eve or Day to lay a 
 large block of wood on the fire and, as soon as it was charred a little, to take 
 it off and preserve it. When a storm threatened, it was kindled again as a 
 protection against lightning. It was called the <i>Christbrand</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-17">11-17</a><a name="Nanchor_11-17"></a> In Thuringia a <i>Christklotz</i> (Christ log) is 
 put on the fire before people go to bed, so that it may burn all through the 
 night. Its remains are kept to protect the house from fire and ill-luck. In 
 parts of Thuringia and in Mecklenburg, Pomerania, East Prussia, Saxony, and 
 Bohemia, the fire is kept up all night on Christmas or New Year's Eve, and the 
 ashes are used to rid cattle of vermin and protect plants and fruit-trees from 
 insects, while in the country between the Sieg <a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a> <a name="Page_257"></a>and Lahn the powdered ashes of an oaken log are strewn 
 during the Thirteen Nights on the fields, to increase their fertility.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-18">11-18</a><a name="Nanchor_11-18"></a> In Sweden, too, some form of Yule log was known,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-19">11-19</a><a name="Nanchor_11-19"></a> and in Greece, as we have seen, the burning of a log 
 is still supposed to be a protection against <i>Kallikantzaroi</i>.</p>
 <p>As for the English customs, they can hardly be better introduced than in 
 Herrick's words:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">“Come, bring, with a noise,</span><br><span class="i3">My merry, merry boys,</span><br><span class="i2">The Christmas Log to the 
 firing:</span><br><span class="i3">While my good Dame she</span><br><span class="i3">Bids ye all be free,</span><br><span class="i2">And drink to your hearts 
 desiring.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i3">With the last year's Brand</span><br><span class="i3">Light the new Block, and</span><br><span class="i2">For good success in 
 his spending,</span><br><span class="i3">On your psaltries play,</span><br><span class="i3">That sweet luck may</span><br><span class="i2">Come while the log is 
 a-teending.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_100">100</a><a name="FNanchor_100"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-20">11-20</a><a name="Nanchor_11-20"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>We may note especially that the block must be kindled with last year's brand; 
 here there is a distinct suggestion that the lighting of the log at Christmas is 
 a shrunken remnant of the keeping up of a perpetual fire, the continuity being 
 to some extent preserved by the use of a brand from last year's blaze.</p>
 <p>Another tradition and its origin are thus described by Sir Laurence 
 Gomme:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“From there being an ever-burning fire, it has come to be that the fire 
   must not be allowed to be extinguished on the last day of the old year, so 
   that the old year's fire may last into the new year. In Lanarkshire it is 
   considered unlucky to give out a light to any one on the morning of the new 
   year, and therefore if the house-fire has been allowed to become extinguished 
   recourse must be had to the embers of <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a> <a name="Page_258"></a>the village pile [for on New Year's Eve a great public 
   bonfire is made]. In some places the self-extinction of the yule-log at 
   Christmas is portentous of evil.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-21">11-21</a><a name="Nanchor_11-21"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>In the north of England in the days of tinder-boxes, if any one could not get 
 a light it was useless to ask a neighbour for one, so frightfully unlucky was it 
 to allow any light to leave the house between Christmas Eve and New Year's 
 Day.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-22">11-22</a><a name="Nanchor_11-22"></a> The idea of the unluckiness of giving out fire at 
 the Kalends of January can be traced back to the eighth century when, as we saw 
 in  <a href="crt10.htm#Chapter_VI">VI</a>, St. Boniface alluded to this superstition among the people or Rome.</p>
 <p>In Shropshire the idea is extended even to ashes, which must not be thrown 
 out of the house on Christmas Day, “for fear of throwing them in Our Saviour's 
 face.” Perhaps such superstitions may originally have had to do with dread that 
 the “luck” of the family, the household spirit, might be carried away with the 
 gift of fire from the hearth.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-23">11-23</a><a name="Nanchor_11-23"></a> </p>
 <p>When Miss Burne wrote in the eighties there were still many West Shropshire 
 people who could remember seeing the “Christmas Brand” drawn by horses to the 
 farmhouse door, and placed at the back of the wide open hearth, where the flame 
 was made up in front of it. “The embers,” says one informant, “were raked up to 
 it every night, and it was carefully tended that it might not go out during the 
 whole season, during which time no light might either be struck, given, or 
 borrowed.” At Cleobury Mortimer in the south-east of the county the silence of 
 the curfew bell during “the Christmas” points to a time when fires might not be 
 extinguished during that season.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-24">11-24</a><a name="Nanchor_11-24"></a> </p>
 <p>The place of the Yule log in Devonshire is taken by the “ashen [sometimes 
 “ashton”] faggot,” still burnt in many a farm on Christmas Eve. The sticks of 
 ash are fastened together by ashen bands, and the traditional custom is for a 
 quart of cider to be called for and served to the merrymaking company, as each 
 band bursts in the flames.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-25">11-25</a><a name="Nanchor_11-25"></a> </p>
 <p>In England the Yule log was often supplemented or replaced <a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a> <a name="Page_259"></a>by a great candle. At Ripon in the eighteenth century the 
 chandlers sent their customers large candles on Christmas Eve, and the coopers, 
 logs of wood.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-26">11-26</a><a name="Nanchor_11-26"></a> Hampson, writing in 1841, says:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“In some places candles are made of a particular kind, because the candle 
   that is lighted on Christmas Day must be so large as to burn from the time of 
   its ignition to the close of the day, otherwise it will portend evil to the 
   family for the ensuing year. The poor were wont to present the rich with wax 
   tapers, and yule candles are still in the north of Scotland given by merchants 
   to their customers. At one time children at the village schools in Lancashire 
   were required to bring each a mould candle before the <i>parting</i> or 
   separation for the Christmas holidays.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_101">101</a><a name="FNanchor_101"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-27">11-27</a><a name="Nanchor_11-27"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>In the Scandinavian countries the Yule candle is, or was, very prominent 
 indeed. In West Jutland (Denmark) two great tallow candles stood on the festive 
 board. No one dared to touch or extinguish them, and if by any mischance one 
 went out it was a portent of death. They stood for the husband and wife, and 
 that one of the wedded pair whose candle burnt the longer would outlive the 
 other.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-28">11-28</a><a name="Nanchor_11-28"></a> </p>
 <p>In Norway also two lights were placed on the table.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-29">11-29</a><a name="Nanchor_11-29"></a> All over the Scandinavian lands the Yule candle had 
 to burn throughout the night; it was not to be extinguished till the sun rose 
 or﻿—as was said elsewhere﻿—till the beginning of service on Christmas Day. 
 Sometimes the putting-out had to be done by the oldest member of the family or 
 the father of the household. In Norway the candle was lighted every evening 
 until New Year's Day. While it foreshadowed death if it went out, so long as it 
 duly burned it shed a blessing with its light, and, in order to secure abundance 
 of good things, money, clothes, food, and drink were spread out that its rays 
 might fall upon them. The remains of the candle were used in various ways to 
 benefit man and beast. Sometimes a cross was branded with them upon the animals 
 on Christmas morning; in Sweden the plough was smeared with <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a> <a name="Page_260"></a>the tallow, when used for the first time in spring. Or 
 again the tallow was given to the fowls; and, lastly, in Denmark the ends were 
 preserved and burnt in thundery weather to protect the house from lightning.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-30">11-30</a><a name="Nanchor_11-30"></a> There is an analogy here with the use of the 
 Christmas log, and also of the candles of the Purification (see  <a href="crt20.htm#Chapter_XVI">XVI</a>).</p>
