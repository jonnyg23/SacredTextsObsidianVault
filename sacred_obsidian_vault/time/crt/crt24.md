 “Christianity,” as here used, will stand for the system of orthodoxy which had 
 been fixed in its main outlines when the festival of Christmas took its rise. 
 The relation of the orthodox creed to historical fact need not concern us here, 
 nor need we for the purposes of this study attempt to distinguish between the 
 Christianity of Jesus and ecclesiastical accretions around his 
 teaching.</p></div>

 Whether the Nativity had previously been celebrated at Rome on January 6 is 
 a matter of controversy; the affirmative view was maintained by Usener in his 
 monograph on Christmas,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-6">1-6</a><a name="Nanchor_1-6"></a> the negative by Monsignor Duchesne.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-7">1-7</a><a name="Nanchor_1-7"></a> A very minute, cautious, and balanced study of both 
 arguments is to be found in Professor Kirsopp Lake's article on Christmas in 
 Hastings's “Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics,”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-8">1-8</a><a name="Nanchor_1-8"></a> and a short article was contributed by the same writer 
 to <i>The Guardian</i>, December 29, 1911. Professor Lake, on the whole, 
 inclines to Usener's view. The early history of the festival is also treated by 
 Father Cyril Martindale in “The Catholic Encyclopædia” (article 
 “Christmas”).</p></div>

 The eastern father, Epiphanius (fourth century), gives a strange account of a 
 heathen, or perhaps in reality a Gnostic, rite held at Alexandria on the night 
 of January 5-6. In the temple of Kore﻿—the Maiden﻿—he tells us, worshippers 
 spent the night in singing and flute-playing, and at cock-crow brought up from a 
 subterranean sanctuary a wooden image seated naked on a litter. It had the sign 
 of the cross upon it in gold in five places﻿—the forehead, the hands, and the 
 knees. This image was carried seven times round the central hall of the temple 
 with flute-playing, drumming, and hymns, and then taken back to the underground 
 chamber. In explanation of these strange actions it was said: “To-day, at this 
 hour, hath Kore (the Maiden) borne the Æon.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-15">1-15</a><a name="Nanchor_1-15"></a> Can there be a connection between this festival and 
 the Eleusinian mysteries? In the latter there was a nocturnal celebration with 
 many lights burning, and the cry went forth, “Holy Brimo (the Maiden) hath borne 
 a sacred child, Brimos.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-16">1-16</a><a name="Nanchor_1-16"></a> The details given by Miss Harrison in her 
 “Prolegomena” of the worship of the child Dionysus﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-17">1-17</a><a name="Nanchor_1-17"></a> are of extraordinary interest, and a minute 
 comparison of this cult with that of the Christ Child might lead to remarkable 
 results.</p></div>

 Mithraism resembled Christianity in its monotheistic tendencies, its sacraments, 
 its comparatively high morality, its doctrine of an Intercessor and Redeemer, 
 and its vivid belief in a future life and judgment to come. Moreover Sunday was 
 its holy-day dedicated to the Sun.</p></div>

 This is the explanation adopted by most scholars (cf. Chambers, “M. S.,” i., 
 241-2). Duchesne suggests as an explanation of the choice of December 25 
 the fact that a tradition fixed the Passion of Christ on March 25. The same 
 date, he thinks, would have been assigned to His Conception in order to make the 
 years of His life complete, and the Birth would come naturally nine months after 
 the Conception. He, however, “would not venture to say, in regard to the 25th of 
 December, that the coincidence of the <i>Sol novus</i> exercised no direct or 
 indirect influence on the ecclesiastical decision arrived at in regard to the 
 matter.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-25">1-25</a><a name="Nanchor_1-25"></a> Professor Lake also, in his article in Hastings's 
 “Encyclopædia,” seeks to account for the selection of December 25 without 
 any deliberate competition with the <i>Natalis Invicti</i>. He points out that 
 the Birth of Christ was fixed at the vernal equinox by certain early 
 chronologists, on the strength of an elaborate and fantastic calculation based 
 on Scriptural data, and connecting the Incarnation with the Creation, and that 
 when the Incarnation came to be viewed as beginning at the Conception instead of 
 the Birth, the latter would naturally be placed nine months later.</p></div>

 Cf. chap. xviii. of Dr. Yrjö Hirn's “The Sacred Shrine” (London, 1912). Dr. Hirn 
 finds a solitary anticipation of the Franciscan treatment of the Nativity in the 
 Christmas hymns of the fourth-century eastern poet, Ephraem Syrus.</p></div>

 It is difficult to be sure of the authenticity of the verse attributed to 
 Jacopone. Many of the poems in Tresatti's edition, from which the quotations in

 comfortably house you; out here in the stable the cold wind comes in at every

 Richard Rolle, poet, mystic, and wandering preacher, in many ways reminds us of 
 Jacopone da Todi. Though he has left no Christmas verses, some lovely words of 
 his show how deeply he felt the wonder and pathos of Bethlehem: “Jhesu es thy 
 name. A! A! that wondryrfull name! A! that delittabyll name! This es the name 
 that es above all names.... I yede [went] abowte be Covaytyse of riches and I 
 fand noghte Jhesu. I satt in companyes of Worldly myrthe and I fand noghte 
 Jhesu.... Therefore I turnede by anothire waye, and I rane a-bowte be Poverte, 
 and I fande Jhesu pure borne in the worlde, laid in a crybe and lappid in 
 clathis.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_2-28">2-28</a><a name="Nanchor_2-28"></a> </p></div>

 “When midnight sounded I leapt from my bed to the floor, and I saw a beautiful 
 angel who sang a thousand times sweeter than a nightingale. The watch-dogs of 
 the neighbourhood all came up. Never had they seen such a sight, and they 
 suddenly began to bark. The shepherds under the straw were sleeping like logs: 
 when they heard the sound of the barking they thought it was the wolves. They 
 were reasonable folk; they came without waiting to be asked. They found in a 
 little stable the Light, even the Truth.”</p></div>

 “Within a poor manger and covered with hay lies Jesus of Nazareth. In the hay 
 lies stretched the Eternal Son of God; to deliver from hell man whom He had 
 created, and to kill sin, our Jesus of Nazareth is content with the hay. He 
 rests between two animals who warm Him from the cold, He who remedies our ills 
 with His great power; His kingdom and seigniory are the world and the calm 
 heaven, and now He sleeps in the hay. He counts it good to bear the cold and 
 fare thus, having no robe to protect or cover Him, and to give us life He 
 suffered cold in the hay, our Jesus of Nazareth.”</p></div>

 “In a porch, full of cobwebs, between the mule and the ox, the Saviour of souls 
 is born.... In the porch at Bethlehem are star, sun, and moon: the Virgin and 
 St. Joseph and the Child who lies in the cradle. In Bethlehem they touch fire, 
 from the porch the flame issues; it is a star of heaven which has fallen into 
 the straw. I am a poor gipsy who come hither from Egypt, and bring to God's 
 Child a cock. I am a poor Galician who come from Galicia, and bring to God's 
 Child linen for a shift. To the new-born Child all bring a gift; I am little and 
 have nothing; I bring him my heart.”</p></div>

 The first mention of a season corresponding to Advent is at the Council of 
 Tours, about 567, when a fast for monks in December is vaguely indicated. At the 
 Council of Mâcon (581) it is enjoined that from Martinmas the second, fourth, 
 and sixth days of the week should be fasting days; and at the close of the sixth 
 century Rome, under Gregory the Great, adopted the rule of the four Sundays in 
 Advent. In the next century it became prevalent in the West. In the Greek 
 Church, forty days of fasting are observed before Christmas; this custom appears 
 to have been established in the thirteenth century. In the Roman Church the 
 practice as to fasting varies: in the British Isles Wednesday and Friday are 
 observed, but in some countries no distinction is made between Advent and 
 ordinary weeks of the year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-2">4-2</a><a name="Nanchor_4-2"></a> </p></div>

 Besides the Nativity plays in the four great cycles there exists a “Shearmen and 
 Tailors Play” which undoubtedly belongs to Coventry, unlike the “Ludus 
 Coventriae,” whose connection with that town is, to say the least, highly 
 doubtful. It opens with a prologue by the prophet Isaiah, and in a small space 
 presents the events connected with the Incarnation from the Annunciation to the 
 Murder of the Innocents. The Nativity and shepherd scenes have less character 
 and interest than those in the great cycles, and need not be dealt with here.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-18">5-18</a><a name="Nanchor_5-18"></a> </p></div>

 Though the ox and ass are not mentioned by St. Luke, it is an easy transition to 
 them from the idea of the manger. Early Christian writers found a Scriptural 
 sanction for them in two passages in the prophets: Isaiah i. 3, “The ox knoweth 
 his owner and the ass his master's crib,” and Habakkuk iii. 2 (a 
 mistranslation), “In the midst of two beasts shall Thou be known.”</p></div>

 Among the Scandinavians, who were late in their conversion, a pre-Christian Yule 
 feast seems to have been held in the ninth century, but it appears to have taken 
 place not in December but about the middle of January, and to have been 
 transferred to December 25 by the Christian king Hakon the Good of Norway 
 (940-63).﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-28">7-28</a><a name="Nanchor_7-28"></a> </p></div>

 It is only right to mention here Professor G. Bilfinger's monograph “Das 
 germanische Julfest” (Stuttgart, 1901), where it is maintained that the only 
 festivals from which the Christmas customs of the Teutonic peoples have sprung 
 are the January Kalends of the Roman Empire and the Christian feast of the 
 Nativity. Bilfinger holds that there is no evidence either of a November 
 beginning-of-winter festival or of an ancient Teutonic midwinter feast. 
 Bilfinger's is the most systematic of existing treatises on Christmas origins, 
 but the considerations brought forward in Tille's “Yule and Christmas” in favour 
 of the November festival are not lightly to be set aside, and while recognizing 
 that its celebration must be regarded rather as a probable hypothesis than an 
 established fact, I shall here follow in general the suggestions of Tille and 
 try to show the contributions of this northern New Year feast to Christmas 
 customs.</p></div>

 Accounts of such maskings are to be found in innumerable books of travel. In 
 <i>Folk-Lore</i>, June 30, 1911, Professor Edward Westermarck gives a 
 particularly full and interesting description of Moroccan customs of this sort. 
 He describes at length various masquerades in the skins and heads of beasts, 
 accompanied often by the dressing-up of men as women and by gross 
 obscenities.</p></div>

 Another suggested explanation connects the change of clothes with rites of 
 initiation at the passage from boyhood to manhood. “Manhood, among primitive 
 peoples, seems to be envisaged as ceasing to be a woman.... Man is born of 
 woman, reared of woman. When he passes to manhood, he ceases to be a 
 woman-thing, and begins to exercise functions other and alien. That moment is 
 one naturally of extreme peril; he at once emphasizes it and disguises it. He 
 wears woman's clothes.” From initiation rites, according to this theory, the 
 custom spread to other occasions when it was desirable to “change the 
 luck.”</p></div>

 According to Sir John Rhys, in the Isle of Man <i>Hollantide</i> 
 (November 1, Old Style, therefore November 12) is still to-day the 
 beginning of a new year. But the ordinary calendar is gaining ground, and some 
 of the associations of the old New Year's Day are being transferred to 
 January 1, the Roman date. “In Wales this must have been decidedly helped 
 by the influence of Roman rule and Roman ideas; but even there the adjuncts of 
 the Winter Calends have never been wholly transferred to the Calends of 
 January.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-4">8-4</a><a name="Nanchor_8-4"></a> </p></div>

 The prominence of “Eves” in festival customs is a point specially to be noticed; 
 it is often to them rather than to the actual feast days that old practices 
 cling. This is perhaps connected with the ancient Celtic and Teutonic habit of 
 reckoning by nights instead of days﻿—a trace of this is left in our word 
 “fortnight”﻿—but it must be remembered that the Church encouraged the same 
 tendency by her solemn services on the Eves of festivals, and that the Jewish 
 Sabbath begins on Friday evening.</p></div>

 Thirteenth. Sometimes then the Twelve Days are spoken of, sometimes the

 with ordinary werewolves, while the other is the type of hairy, clawed demons

 It is to be borne in mind that the oak was a sacred tree among the heathen 
 Slavs; it was connected with the thunder-god Perun, the counterpart of Jupiter, 
 and a fire of oak burned night and day in his honour. The neighbours of the 
 Slavs, the Lithuanians, had the same god, whom they called Perkunas; they too 
 kept up a perpetual oak-fire in his honour, and in time of drought they used to 
 pour beer on the flames, praying to Perkunas to send showers.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-10">11-10</a><a name="Nanchor_11-10"></a> The libations of wine on the Yule log may

 At Wormesley in Herefordshire there is a Holy Thorn which is still believed to 
 blossom exactly at twelve o'clock on Twelfth Night. “The blossoms are thought to 
 open at midnight, and drop off about an hour afterwards. A piece of thorn 
 gathered at this hour brings luck, if kept for the rest of the year.” As 
 recently as 1908 about forty people went to see the thorn blossom at this time 
 (see E. M. Leather, “The Folk-Lore of Herefordshire” [London, 1912],

 This may be compared with the ancient Greek <i>Eiresione</i>, “a portable 
 May-pole, a branch hung about with wool, acorns, figs, cakes, fruits of all 
 sorts and sometimes wine-jars.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-35">12-35</a><a name="Nanchor_12-35"></a> </p></div>

 In Welsh it has also the name of “the tree of pure gold,” a rather surprising 
 title for a plant with green leaves and white berries. Dr. Frazer has sought to 
 explain this name by the theory that in a roundabout way the sun's golden fire 
 was believed to be an emanation from the mistletoe, in which the life of the 
 oak, whence fire was kindled, was held to reside.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-47">12-47</a><a name="Nanchor_12-47"></a> </p></div>

 Dancing is, as everyone knows, a common and indeed a central feature of 
 primitive festivals; and such dancing is wont to take a dramatic form, to be 
 mimetic, whether re-enacting some past event or <i>pre</i>-doing something with 
 magical intent to produce it.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-10">14-10</a><a name="Nanchor_14-10"></a> The Greek tragedy itself probably sprang from a 
 primitive dance of a dramatic and magical character, centred in a death and

 In Thessaly and Macedonia at Carnival time folk-plays of a somewhat similar 
 character are performed, including a quarrel, a death, and a miraculous

 the fertility of vegetation.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-12">14-12</a><a name="Nanchor_14-12"></a> Parallels can be found in the Carnival customs of

 A remarkably clear instance of the transference of customs from Hollantide Eve 
 (Hallowe'en) to the modern New Year is given by Sir John Rhys. Certain methods 
 of prognostication described by him are practised by some people in the Isle of 
 Man on the one day and by some on the other, and the Roman date is gaining 
 ground.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-1">16-1</a><a name="Nanchor_16-1"></a> </p></div>

 The custom of “burning the bush,” still surviving here and there in 
 Herefordshire, shows a certain resemblance to this. The “bush,” a globe made of 
 hawthorn, hangs throughout the year in the farmhouse kitchen, with the 
 mistletoe. Early on New Year's Day it “is carried to the earliest sown wheat 
 field, where a large fire is lighted, of straw and bushes, in which it is burnt. 
 While it is burning, a new one is made; in making it, the ends of the branches 
 are scorched in the fire.” Burning straw is carried over twelve ridges of the 
 field, and then follow cider-drinking and cheering. (See Leather, “Folk-Lore of 
 Herefordshire,” 91 f.)</p></div></div>
