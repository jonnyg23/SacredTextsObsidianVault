 <h3 align="CENTER">§ 2. True Black Magic</h3>
 <p>The Grimoire entitled <i>True Black Magic</i> is simply an adapted version of the <i>Key of Solomon</i>, with the same preambles, the same ritual, the same talismans, and characters which are analogous when they are not identical. With the moderately intelligible and religiously careful presentation of Mr. Mathers it of course compares very badly; like the <i>Grimorium Verum</i>, it is exceedingly confused, and is rendered almost unmeaning by the omission of all the practical part. Its malicious or diabolical element consists, however, more especially in its introduction of the chapter upon works of hatred and' destruction, which, as already seen, and as more fully established later on, should undoubtedly be regarded as an integral portion of the original work.</p>
