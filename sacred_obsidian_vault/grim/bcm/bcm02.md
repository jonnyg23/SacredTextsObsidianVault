Figure III., the inscription on this talisman is unintelligible. Figure IV., the occult symbol of the pentagram, reversed, and therefore the sign of the Demon, according to Éliphas Lévi.

Figure VI., undescribed, but belonging to a prayer of St. Augustine addressed to the Holy Spirit to receive a revelation. Figure VII., the characters of this talisman would seem to be Hebrew, but are so corrupt that they are unintelligible. Figure VIII., a talisman with the monogram of Gabriel. Figure IX., the talisman and monogram of Michael.</p>

 <p>The figure and place of the triangle into which the spirit is commanded will be found, with description, in the text, pp. <a href="bcm60.htm#page_220">220</a>-223. The Divine Names differ in some of the manuscripts.</p>

 <p>The Goëtic Circle of Black Evocations and Pacts, according to Éliphas Lévi.</p>
 <p>The circle is formed from the skin of the victim, fastened to the ground by four nails taken from the coffin of an executed criminal. The skull is that of a parricide; the horns those of a goat; the male bat opposite the skull must have been drowned in blood; and the black cat, whose head forms the fourth object on the circumference of the circle, must have been fed on human flesh. There is no authority for any of these stipulations. The small circles within the triangle show the place of the operator and his assistants.</p>
