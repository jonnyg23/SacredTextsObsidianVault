 <h3 align="CENTER">§ 5. Concerning Virgin Wax or Virgin Earth <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">1</font></a></h3>
 <p>The candles used in evocation or in other magical experiences, and the images required for bewitchment, must be composed of virgin wax or virgin earth--that is to say, the substances in question must not have been applied previously to another purpose. <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">2</font></a> Before operating the following words must be recited over the material:--ENTABOR, NATABOR, <i>Si tacibor</i>, ADONAY, AN, LAYAMON, TINARMES, EOS PHILODES. <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>Angels Of God, be ye present! I invoke you in my work, that I may obtain virtue by your mediation and may be perfected very surely</i>. Then recite the Psalms <i>Domine, non est exaltatum cor meum and Domine, quis habitabit</i>, <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">4</font></a> adding these words: <i>I exorcise thee, creature of wax</i> [<i>or earth</i>], <i>and, by the Creator and God Almighty, Who created all things from nothing by His Most Holy Name, and by His angels, I ordain thee to receive virtue and benediction in His Name, that so thou mayst be sanctified and blessed, thus obtaining that virtue which we desire, by the Most Holy Name </i>ADONAY<i>, which is the life of all creatures, Amen</i>. Asperge the substance with the holy water of the Art, after which preserve it, to make use thereof when needed. So doing, says <i>True Black Magic</i>, thou shalt obtain a sure result in all which thou undertakest. <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="bcm46.htm#fr_124">168:1</a> This process is adapted from the <i>Key of Solomon</i>, Book ii. c. 8.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="bcm46.htm#fr_125">168:2</a> The virginity of the wax and the earth is more perfectly ensured by the directions of the <i>Key of Solomon</i>, in accordance with which the operator must dig up the earth with his own hands and reduce it to a paste, using no instrument in case of defilement. The wax must be taken from bees who have made it for the first time.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_125"></a><a href="bcm46.htm#fr_126">168:3</a> These names differ from those in the <i>Key of Solomon</i>, which, however, are, for the most part, equally unintelligible.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_126"></a><a href="bcm46.htm#fr_127">168:4</a> Ps. cxxx. and Ps. xiv. in the Vulgate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_127"></a><a href="bcm46.htm#fr_128">168:5</a> The <i>Key of Solomon</i> directs that the earth should be freshly dug up on each occasion that it is required.</p>
