 <h3 align="CENTER">THE VESSEL OF BRASS.</h3>
 <p>THIS is the Form of the Vessel of Brass wherein King Solomon did shut up the Evil Spirits, etc. (<i>See Figures</i> 158 <a name="img_fig158"></a>
 <a href="img/fig158.jpg"><img src="tn/generic.jpg"></a> and 159 <a name="img_fig159"></a>
 <a href="img/fig159.jpg"><img src="tn/generic.jpg"></a>.) (Somewhat different forms are given in</p>
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>
 <p>the various codices. The seal in Figure 160 <a name="img_fig160"></a>
 <a href="img/fig160.jpg"><img src="tn/generic.jpg"></a> was made in brass to cover this vessel with at the top. This history of the genii shut up in the brazen vessel by King Solomon recalls the story of "The Fisherman and the Jinni" in "The Arabian Nights." In this tale, however, there was only one jinni shut up in a vessel of yellow brass the which was covered at the top with a leaden seal. This jinni tells the fisherman that his name is Sakhr, or Sacar.)</p>
