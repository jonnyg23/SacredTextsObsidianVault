 <h1 align="CENTER">PREFACE</h1>
 <p>This translation of the FIRST BOOK of the "<i>Lemegeton</i>" which is now for the first time made accessible to students of TALISMANIC MAGIC was done, after careful collation and edition, from numerous <i>Ancient Manuscripts</i> in <i>Hebrew, Latin</i>, and <i>French</i>, by G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F., by the order of the <i>Secret Chief</i> of the <i>Rosicrucian Order</i>. <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> The G. H. Fra., having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the <i>Four Great Princes</i> (acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed expedient that the work should be brought to its conclusion by another hand. The investigation of a competent Skryer into the house of our unhappy <i>Fra</i>., confirmed this divination; neither our <i>Fra</i>. nor his <i>Hermetic Mul</i>. were there seen; but only the terrible shapes of the evil <i>Adepts</i> S.V.A. <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a> and H., whose original bodies having</p>

 <p>been sequestered by Justice, were no longer of use to them. On this we stayed no longer Our Hand; but withdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the Rota, and the Books M. and Q. did decide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley, a poet, and skilled student of <i>Magical Lore</i>, and an expert <i>Kabbalist</i>, to complete openly that which had been begun in secret. <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">1</font></a> This is that which is written: "His Bishoprick let another take." And again: "<i>Oculi Tetragammaton</i>." This is also that which is said: "Nomen Secundum refertur ad <i>Gebhurah</i>; qui est Rex <i>Bittul</i> atque Corruptio <i>Achurajim Patris et Matris</i> hoc indigitatur."</p>
 <p>And so saying we wish you well.</p><dir>

 <p><a name="fn_0"></a><a href="lks01.htm#fr_0">3:1</a> Mr. A. E. Waite writes ("Real History Of The Rosicrucians," p. 426): "I beg leave to warn my readers that all persons who proclaim themselves to be Rosicrucians are simply members of pseudo-fraternities, and that there is that difference between their assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of a lie consists!" It is within the <i>Editor's</i> personal knowledge that Mr. Waite was (and still is probably) a member of a society claiming to be the R.C. fraternity As <i>Mr. Waite</i> constantly hints in his writing that he is in touch with initiated centres, I think the <i>syllogism</i>, whose premises are given above, is fair, if not quite formal.--ED.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1"></a><a href="lks01.htm#fr_1">3:2</a> It was owing to our <i>Fra</i>. receiving this S.V.A. as his Superior, and giving up the <i>Arcana</i> of our <i>Fraternity</i> into so unhallowed a power, that We decided no longer to leave Our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus easily imposed upon. (For by a childish and easy magical trick did S.V.A. persuade D.D.C.F. of that lie.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2"></a><a href="lks01.htm#fr_2">4:1</a> He that is appointed to complete in secret that which had been begun openly is R.R., and to be heard of at the care of the Editor.</p>
