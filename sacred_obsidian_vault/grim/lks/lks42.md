 <h3 align="CENTER">YE LICENSE TO YE SPIRIT Y<sup>T</sup> HE MAYE DEPART.</h3>
 <p>O thou Spirit N. because thou art the servant of fealty and obedience, and because thou art he that obeyeth my power and thy creation; therefore I say Descend unto thy dwelling, obey the law which I have made, without terror to the sons of men, creatures, all things upon the surface of the earth.</p>
 <p>Descend therefore I say, and be thou as stewards of Time; come forth in a moment, even as servants that hearken to the voice of the Lord; in the moment in which I invoke thee and stir thee up and move thee in the, mysteries of the secret wisdom of the Creator!</p>
 <p>Descend unto thy dwelling place in pleasure: let there be the mercies of God upon thee: be friendly in continuing; whose long continuance shall be comforters unto all creatures. Amen.</p>
