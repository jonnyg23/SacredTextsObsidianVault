 <p align="CENTER">Conjuration</p>
 <p align="CENTER">AI, AI, AI--Arise, Thou eternal Angel!</p>
 <p>This must be repeated three times in a loud voice, and the horn must also be blown three times, for he is an angel of the sanctuary.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">Prayer</p>
 <p>Thou that art, wast, and wilt be in the old and new covenant! Eternal, Jehovah, Jesus Christ, Messias, All Beautiful, All True, All Holy! All Loving and All Merciful in the old and in the new covenant. Thou hast said: Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Thou hast said: I came not to destroy the old covenant, but to fulfill it. Thou hast said: He who sees me, sees the Father. Thou hast said: If ye have true faith, ye can perform the wonders which I have done, yea, ye will perform yet much greater wonders than I have done. Come also to me for the sake of my faith, come also unto me for the sake of Moses, Thy messenger of faith. Reveal also to me Thy mysterious name from Jehovah, as Thou once did to Thy fire prophet Moses in solitude. Come, and say unto me in love, through the heart of Moses and with the tongue of Aaron: SCAHEBUAL! I shall come!</p>
