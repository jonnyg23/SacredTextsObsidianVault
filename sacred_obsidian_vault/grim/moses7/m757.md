 <h3 align="CENTER">THE PENTAGON OR OMNIPOTENT FIVE CORNERS</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><img src="img/08500.jpg"></p>
 <p>This mysterious figure must be written before the conjuration, in the open air and on the ground, with consecrated chalk or with the index finger of the right hand dipped in holy three-king's water, the same as it is written on the illustration, but each line must be thirteen feet in length. The conjuror then kneels in the center of the star, facing east with head uncovered, and calls out thirteen times, with great faith and fervor, the names of the three kings, Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar. He then calls out, with equal sentiment, the most sacred name of Elohim, 375 times. This conjuration can only take place during the first three days or nights of the new or full moon, or when Saturn, Mars and Jupiter are visible in the heavens, as established in the Laws of Entrance.</p>
