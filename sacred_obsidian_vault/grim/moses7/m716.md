 <h1 align="CENTER">Extract from the Magical Kabala</h1>
 <p>The Citation-Formulas contained in this book must only be pronounced in the Hebrew language, and in no other. In any other language they have no power whatever, and the Master can never be sure of their effects. For all these words and forms were thus pronounced by the Great Spirit, and have power only in the Hebrew language.</p>
