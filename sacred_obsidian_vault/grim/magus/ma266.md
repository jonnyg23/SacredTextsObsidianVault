 <p>GEORGE RIPLEY, an <i>Englishman</i> by nation, and by profession a canon or monk of <i>Britlingthon</i>. His writings were all very good in their kind, being wrote exactly in the style of <i>Bacon</i>, only more allegorical. As he was no physician, he does not meddle with any thing of the preparations of that kind; but treats much of the cure of metals, which in his language is the purification and maturation thereof. He rigorously pursued <i>Geber's</i> and <i>Bacon's</i> principles, and maintained, for instance, with new evidence, that mercury is the universal matter of all metals; that this set over the fire, with the purest sulphur, will become gold, but that if either of them be sick or leprous, <i>i. e.</i> infected with any impurity, instead of gold, some other metal will be produced. He adds, that as mercury and sulphur are sufficient for the making of all metals: so of these may an universal medicine, or metal, be produced for curing of all the sick; which some mistakenly understood of an universal metal, efficacious in all the diseases of the human body.</p>
