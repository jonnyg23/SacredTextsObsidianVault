 <font size="4"><p align="CENTER">JOHN RUDOLPH GLAUBER</p></font>.
 <p>R. GLAUBER, a celebrated chymist of <i>Amsterdam</i>, accounted the <i>Paracelsus</i> of his time: he had travelled much and by that means attained to a great many secrets. He wrote above thirty tracts, in some of which he acted the physician; in others, the adept; and in others, the metallist. He principally excelled in the last capacity, and alchymy.</p>
 <p>He was a person of easy and genteel address, and, beyond dispute, well versed in chymistry: being author of the salt, still used in the shops, called <i>Sal Glauberi</i>; as also of all the salts, by oil of vitriol., &amp;c. He is noted for extolling his arcanæ and preparations, and is reported to have traded unfairly with his secrets: the best of them he would sell, at excessive rates, to chymists and others, and would afterwards re-sell them, or make them public, to increase his fame; whence he was continually at variance with them.</p>
 <p>The principal of his writings are <i>De Furnis</i>, and <i>De Metallis</i>, which, though wrote in <i>Dutch</i>, have been translated into <i>Latin</i> and <i>English</i>. It was <i>Glauber</i> who shewed, before the States of <i>Holland</i>, that there is gold contained in sand; and made an experiment thereof to their entire satisfaction: but so</p>

 <p>much lead, fire, and labour, being employed in procuring it, that the art would not pay charges <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a>. However he plainly demonstrated, that there is no earth, sand, sulphur, or salt, or other matter, but what contains gold in a greater or less quantity. In short, he possessed a great many secrets, which are at this time in the hands of some of our modern chymists.</p>
