 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">OF THE NUMBER TWO, AND SCALE</p></font>.
 <p>THE first number is two, because it is the first multitude; it can be measured by no number besides unity alone, the common measure of all numbers; it is not compounded of numbers, but of one unity only; neither is it called a number uncompounded, but more properly not compounded. The number three, is called the first number uncompounded. But the number two is the first branch of unity, and the first procreation; and it is called the number of science, and memory, and of light, and the number of man, who is called</p>

 <p>another, and the lesser world: it is also called the number of charity, and of mutual love; of marriage, and society: as it is said by the Lord--"Two shall be one flesh."--And Solomon saith, "It is better that two be together than one, for they have a benefit by their mutual society: if one shall fall, he shall be supported by the other. Woe to him that is alone; because, when he falls, he hath not another to help him. And if two sleep together, they shall warm one another; how shall one be hot alone?--And if any prevail against him, two resist him." And it is called the number of wedlock, and sex; for there are two sexes--masculine and feminine. And two doves bring forth two eggs; out of the first of which is hatched the male, out of the second the female, It is also called the middle, that is capable, that is good and bad, partaking; and the beginning of division, of multitude, and distinction; and signifies matter. This is also, sometimes, the number of discord, of confusion, of misfortune, and uncleanness; whence St. Hierom, against Jovianus, saith--"that therefore it was not spoken in the second day of the creation of the world."--"And God said, that it was good;"--because the number of two is evil. Hence also it was, that God commanded that all unclean animals should go into the ark by couples; because, as I said, the number of two is a number of uncleanness. Pythagorus, as Eusebius reports, said, that unity was God, and a good intellect; but that duality was a devil, and an evil intellect, in which is a material multitude: wherefore the Pythagorians say, that two is not a number, but a certain confusion of unities. And Plutarch writes, that the Pythagorians called unity, Apollo; and two, strife and boldness; and three, justice, which is the highest perfection, and is not without many mysteries. Hence there were two tables of the law in Sinai--two cherubims looking to the propitiatory in Moses--two olives dropping oil, in Zachariah--two natures in Christ, divine and human: hence Moses saw two appearances of God, <i>viz.</i> his face, and back parts;--also two Testaments--two commands of love--two first dignities--two first people--two kinds of spirits, good and bad--two intellectual creatures, an angel and soul--two great lights--two solstitia--two equinoctials--two poles--two elements, producing a living soul, <i>viz.</i> earth and water.</p>
