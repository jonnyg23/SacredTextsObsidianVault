 <i><font size="4"><p align="CENTER">A</p></font></i> CAUTION <i>to the inexperienced in this</i> ART, <i>and a Word of Advice to those who would be Adepts</i>.
 <p>    BROTHER,</p>
 <p>IT is necessary for me to inform thee, that whatever thy desires are in the pursuit of this art, which we call Magic, so wilt thy connexion and answer be. If in the pursuit of revenge, it is but proper thou shouldest know that thou wilt, in any of these experiments here laid down, draw to thyself a revengeful demon, or an infernal furious spirit, serving in the principle of the wrath of God; if worldly riches and aggrandizement, then shalt thou have an earthial or fiery spirit, which will delude thee with the riches of the central world; if fame, or the blaze of glory, then the <i>spirits of pride</i> will be allotted thee, who will gratify thy inordinate desire of vain glory; for all these offices are there spirits allotted and will be eager to mix with thy spirit: it will attract thee to his own nature, and serve all thy purposes according to the extent of God's permission; and as thy desires are and from what principle they proceed, so shalt thou be answered: but if thou desirest to know nothing but for the honour and glory of God, and the help of thy neighbour, and, in great humility, fill thy heart with the love of God, thou shalt then have a pure spirit which</p>
 <p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a></p>
 <p>will grant (by the Lord's permission) they desires. Therefore seek for that which is good; avoid all evil either in thought, word, or action; pray to God to fill thee with wisdom, and then thou shalt reap an abundant harvest. There are two ways magically set before thee; chuse which thou wilt, thou shalt be sure of thy reward. Farewel.</p>
