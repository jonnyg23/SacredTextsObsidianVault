 <i><font size="4"><p align="CENTER">Of the Benediction of</p></font></i> LIGHTS, LAMPS, WAX, &amp;c.
 <p>NOW, the blessing of the lights, lamps, wax, &amp;c. is taken from the fire, and whatever contains the substance of the flame, and whatever similitudes are in the mysteries, as the seven candlesticks which burn before the face of God.</p>

 <p>Therefore we have here given the manner of composing the consecrations, which first of all are necessary to be used in every kind of ceremony, and ought to precede every experiment or work, and without which nothing in magic rites can be duly performed.</p>
 <p>In the next place, we will shew thee the consecration of <i>places, instruments</i>, and the like things.</p>
