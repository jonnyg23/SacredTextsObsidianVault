 <h3 align="CENTER">OF THE EXPERIMENT OF SEEKING FAVOUR AND LOVE <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">1</font></a></h3>
 <p>IF thou wishest to perform the Experiment of seeking favour and love, observe in what manner the Experiment is to be carried out, and if it be dependent upon the day and the hour, perform it in the day and the hour required, as thou wilt find it in the Chapter concerning the hours; and if the Experiment be one that requireth writing, thou shalt write as it is said in the Chapter concerning the same; and if it be with penal bonds, pacts, and fumigations, then thou shalt cense with a fit perfume as is said in the Chapter concerning suffumigations; and if it be necessary to sprinkle it with water and hyssop, then let it be as in the Chapter concerning the same; similarly if such Experiment require characters, names, or the like, let such names be written as the Chapter concerning the writing of characters, and place the same in a clean place as hath been said. Then thou shalt repeat over it the following Oration:--</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE ORATION.</h3>
 <p>O ADONAI, most Holy, Most Righteous, and most Mighty God, Who hast made all things through Thy Mercy and Righteousness wherewith Thou art filled, grant unto us that we may be found worthy that this Experiment may be found consecrated and perfect, so that the Light may issue from Thy Most Holy Seat, O ADONAI, which may obtain for us favour and love. Amen.</p>
 <p>This being said, thou shalt place it in clean silk, and bury it for a day and a night at the junction of four cross-roads; and whensoever thou wishest to obtain any grace or favour from any, take it, having first properly consecrated it according to the rule, and place it in thy right hand, and seek thou what thou wilt it shall not be denied thee. But if thou doest not the Experiment carefully and rightly, assuredly thou shalt not succeed in any manner.</p>
