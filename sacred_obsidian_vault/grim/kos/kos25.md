 <p>Figure 11.--The First Pentacle of Saturn.--This Pentacle is of great value and utility for striking terror into the Spirits. Wherefore, upon its being shown to them they submit, and kneeling upon the earth before it, they obey.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The Hebrew letters within the square are the four great Names of God which are written with four letters:--IHVH, Yod, He, Vau, He; ADNI, Adonai; IIAI, Yiai (this Name has the same</p>

 <p>Figure 12.--The Second Pentacle of Saturn.--This Pentacle is of great value against adversities; and of especial use in repressing the pride of the Spirits.</p>

 <p>the most perfect existing form of double acrostic, as far as the arrangement of the letters is concerned; it is repeatedly mentioned in the records of mediæval Magic; and, save to very few, its derivation from the present Pentacle has been unknown. It will be seen at a glance that it is a square of five, giving twenty-five letters, which, added to the unity, gives twenty six, the numerical value of IHVH. The Hebrew versicle surrounding it is taken from Psalm lxxii. 8, 'His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, and from the flood unto the world's end.' This passage consists also of exactly twenty-five letters, and its total numerical value (considering the final letters with increased numbers), added to that of the Name Elohim, is exactly equal to the total numerical value of the twenty-five letters in the Square.</p>

 <p>Figure 13.--The Third Pentacle of Saturn.--This should be made within the Magical Circle, and it is good for use at night when thou invokest the Spirits of the nature of Saturn.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The characters at the ends of the rays of the Mystic Wheel are Magical Characters of Saturn. Surrounding it are the Names of the Angels:--Omeliel, Anachiel, Arauchiah, and Anazachia, written in Hebrew.</p>
