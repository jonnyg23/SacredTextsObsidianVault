 <font size="1">PLATE XII</font>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 50.--The Second Pentacle of the Moon.--This serveth against all perils and dangers by water, and if it should chance that the Spirits of the Moon should excite and cause great rain and exceeding tempests about the Circle, in order to astonish and terrify thee; on showing unto them this Pentacle, it will all speedily cease.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--A hand pointing to the Name El, and to that of the Angel Abariel. The versicle is from Psalm lvi. ii:--'In Elohim have I put my trust, I will not fear, what can man do unto me</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 51.--The Third Pentacle of the Moon.--This being duly borne with thee when upon a journey, if it be properly made, serveth against all attacks by night, and against every kind of danger and peril by Water.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The Names Aub and Vevaphel. The versicle is from Psalm xl. 13:--'Be pleased O IHVH to deliver me, O IHVH make haste to help me.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 52.--The Fourth Pentacle of the Moon.--This defendeth thee from all evil sorceries, and from all injury unto soul or body. Its Angel, Sophiel, giveth the knowledge of the virtue of all herbs and stones; and unto whomsoever shall name him, he will procure the knowledge of all.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The Divine Name Eheieh Asher Eheieh, and the Names of the Angels Yahel and Sophiel. The versicle is:--'Let them be confounded who persecute me, and let me not be confounded; let them fear,and not I.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p>Figure 53.--The Fifth Pentacle of the Moon.--It serveth to have answers in sleep. Its Angel Iachadiel serveth unto destruction and loss, as well as unto the destruction of enemies. Thou mayest also call upon him by Abdon and Dalé against all Phantoms of the night, and to summon the souls of the departed from Hades.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The Divine Names IHVH and Elohim, a mystical character of the Moon, and the Names of the Angels Iachadiel and Azarel. The versicle is from Psalm lxviii. 1:--'Let God arise, and let His enemies be scattered; let them also who hate Him flee before Him.'</p>
 <p align="CENTER">______________________</p>
 <p><a href="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 54</a>--The Sixth and Last Pentacle of the Moon.--This is wonderfully good, and serveth excellently to excite and cause heavy rains, if it be engraved upon a plate of silver; and if it be placed under water,</p>
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>
 <p>as long as it remaineth there, there will be rain. It should be engraved, drawn, or written in the day and hour of the Moon.</p>
 <i></i><p>Editor's Note.--The Pentacle is composed of mystical characters of the Moon, surrounded by a versicle from Genesis vii. 11, 12:--'All the fountains of the great deep were broken up . . . and the rain was upon the earth.'</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[This is the end of the Holy Pentacles, in all which I have, to the best of my power, restored the Hebrew letters and mystical characters correctly. I have further given nearly every versicle in pointed Hebrew, instead of in the Latin; so that the Occult student might not be inconvenienced by having to search out the same in a Hebrew Bible. The restoration of the Hebrew letters in the body of the Pentacles has been a work of immense difficulty, and has extended over several years.}</p>
