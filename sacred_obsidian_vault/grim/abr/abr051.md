 <p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angel or by the Guardian Angel.</p>  
 <p>(<i>b</i>) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the operations hereof by means of their common Ministers.</p>  
 <p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits do not execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
 <p>(<i>d</i>) Take the Symbol in the hand, and name the Spirit desired, who will appear in the form commanded.</p>  
 <p>(<i>e</i>) It will be noticed at once that of the four Symbols of this Chapter, the first has the name of the Archangel Uriel, and the three others those of three of the Chief Princes of the Demons, <i>viz.</i>;--Lucifer, Leviathan, and Satan.</p>  
 <p>No. 1 is an Acrostic of 25 Squares.--URIEL from Hebrew AURIEL = Light of God.--RAMIE from Hebrew RMIH = Deceit. IMIMI is either from IMM = the Sea, or great waters, or from IMIM = Mules--EIMAR is probably from AMR or IMR = To speak.--LEIRU is the reverse of URIEL, <i>i.e.</i>, Uriel written backwards.--This formula seems to show that the Symbol should be numbered 2 instead of 1.</p>  
 <p>No. 2 is an Acrostic of 49 Squares.--LUCIFER from Lucifer (Latin) = Light bearer. This Square should probably be numbered 3.</p>  
 <p>No. 3 is an Acrostic of 64 Squares.--LEVIATAN from Hebrew,= the piercing or twisting Serpent. This Square should probably be numbered 1.</p>  
 <p>No. 4 is an Acrostic of 25 Squares.--SATAN from Hebrew SHTN an Adversary.--ADAMA from Hebrew ADMH reddish earth.</p>
