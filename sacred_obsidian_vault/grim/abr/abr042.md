 <p> </p>  
 <p>The Operations of the following Chapters can also (to a great extent) be administered by the Familiar Spirits, namely:--</p>

 <p>Chapter XXVIII. (Obtaining Money.)</p>  
 <p>Chapter XXX. (Visions of Operas, Comedies, etc.)</p>  
 <p>If at the beginning they excuse themselves from the performance, there is probably some hindering cause, and in this case you should make use of other Spirits; but otherwise they must obey you in and throughout everything that you shall command them.</p>
