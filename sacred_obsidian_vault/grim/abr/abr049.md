   <h3 align="center">NOTES TO CHAPTER II.</h3>  
 <p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested partly by the Angels, and partly by the Evil Spirits.</p>  
 <p>(<i>b</i>) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Operations hereof by the means of their common Ministers.</p>  
 <p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
 <p>(<i>d</i>) Take the Symbol in your hand, and name what information you require. (In the Second Book, the remarks given concerning this Chapter are evidently far more applicable to the Third Chapter, and I have therefore given them there instead of here.)</p>  
 <p>(<i>e</i>) No. 1 is an Acrostic of 25 Squares.--ALLUP from Hebrew ALUP = a Doctor, Teacher, Leader, <i>i.e.</i>, a person who at the same time leads and instructs his following. Hence also this word means a Bull as the Leader of the herd.--URIEL, Hebrew AURIEL = Light of God, is the well-known name of one of the Archangels. Pulla in Latin means both a fowl, and also light friable earth; but is probably here derivable rather from the Hebrew PLH, meaning to classify or arrange.</p>  
 <p>No. 2 is an Acrostic of 64 Squares.--MELAMMED is evidently from Hebrew MLMD = a stimulus or spur to exertion.</p>  
 <p>No. 3 is an Acrostic of 49 Squares.--EKDILUN <i>may</i> be from the Greek EKDEILON, which means, "not afraid of"; from EK in composition, and DEILON, frightened, cowardly.</p>
