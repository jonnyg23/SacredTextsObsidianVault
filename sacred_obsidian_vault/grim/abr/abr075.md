   <h3 align="center">NOTES TO CHAPTER XV.</h3>  
 <p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested in part by the Angels, and in part also by the Evil Spirits.</p>  
 <p>(<i>b</i>) ASMODEE and MAGOT together execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
 <p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
 <p>(<i>d</i>) As for these Symbols and all like ones appertaining unto this Chapter, when you shall wish to make use of them, you shall put them between two plates, dishes, or jugs, closed together on the outside of a window; and before a quarter of an hour shall have passed you will find and will have that which you have demanded;</p>

 <p>but you must clearly understand that with such kinds of viands you cannot nourish men for more than two days. For this food although it be appreciable by the eyes, and by the mouth, doth not long nourish the body, which hath soon hunger again, seeing that this food gives no strength to the stomach. Know also that none of these viands can remain visible for more than 24 hours, the which period being passed, fresh ones will be requisite.</p>  
 <p>(<i>e</i>) This Chapter naturally brings to one's mind the descriptions of the Magic feasts in the "Arabian Nights" and elsewhere.</p>  
 <p>No. 1 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares. IAIIN means "Let there be wine". Evidently therefore this Square should be numbered 3, instead of 1.</p>  
 <p>No. 2 consists of 10 Squares taken from a Square of 25 Squares. BASAR means "flesh".</p>  
 <p>No. 3 consists of 21 Squares in the form of the Roman Capital Letter E, taken from a Square of 36 Squares.--LECHEM means "bread," CNOHAH implies "corn," and MECHEL means "a cake". Therefore this should evidently be numbered 1, instead of 3. MECHEL also means "a window".</p>  
 <p>No. 4 is a Square of 25 Squares.--DACAD should be spelt with a G instead of a C; the meaning is "bring forth fish". CAMAC means "meal, or flour". AFARA may be from the Greek adverb APHAR = "straightway or forthwith"; but if taken as a Hebrew root may mean "bring forth fruit".</p>  
 <p>No. 5 is a Gnomon of 15 Squares and 3 other supplementary ones taken from a Square of 64 Squares. LEBHINAH is from LBA = "milk," and INH "to squeeze".</p>
