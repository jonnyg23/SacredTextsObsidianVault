 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>INQUIRY. Let us inquire in the first place: What is Scepticism? The word means 
   looking, questioning, investigating. One must pass by contemptuously the Christian 
   liar's gloss which interprets "sceptic" as "mocker"; though 
   in a sense it is true for him, since to inquire into Christianity is assuredly 
   to mock at it; but I am concerned to intensify the etymological connotation 
   in several respects. First, I do not regard mere incredulity as necessary to 
   the idea, though credulity is incompatible with it. Incredulity implies a prejudice 
   in favour of a negative conclusion; and the true sceptic should be perfectly 
   unbiassed. </p>
 <p>Second, I exclude "vital scepticism." What's the good of anyfink? 
   expects (as we used to learn about "nonne?") the answer, "Why 
   nuffink!" and again is prejudiced. Indolence is no virtue in a questioner. 
   Eagerness, intentness, concentration, vigilance --- all these I include in the 
   connotation of "sceptic." Such questioning as has been called "vital 
   scepticism" is but a device to avoid true questioning, and therefore its 
   very antithesis, the devil disguised as an angel of light. </p>
 <p>[Or "vice vers", friend, if you are a Satanist; 'tis a matter 
   of words --- words --- words. You may write "x" for "y" 
   in your equations, so long as you consistently write "y" for "x". 
   They remain unchanged --- and unsolved. Is not all our "knowledge" 
   an example of this fallacy of writing one unknown for another, and then crowing 
   like Peter's cock?] </p>
 <p>I picture the true sceptic as a man eager and alert, his deep eyes glittering 
   like sharp swords, his hands tense with effort as he asks, "What does it 
   matter?" </p>
 <p>I picture the false sceptic as a dude or popinjay, yawning, with dull eyes, 
   his muscles limp, his purpose in asking the question but the expression of his 
   slackness and stupidity. </p>
 <p>This true sceptic is indeed the man of science; as Wells' "Moreau" 
   tells us. He has devised some means of answering his first question, and its 
   answer is another question. It is difficult to conceive of any question, indeed, 
   whose answer does not imply a thousand further questions. So simple an inquiry 
   as "Why is sugar sweet?" involves an infinity of chemical researches, 
   each leading ultimately to the blank wall --- what is matter? and an infinity 
   of physiological researches, each (similarly) leading to the blank wall --- 
   what is mind? </p>
 <p>Even so, the relation between the two ideas is unthinkable; causality is itself 
   unthinkable; it depends, for one thing, upon experience --- and what, in God's 
   name, is experience? Experience is impossible without memory. What is memory? 
   The mortar of the temple of the ego, whose bricks are the impressions. And the 
   ego? The sum of our experience, may be. (I doubt it!) Anyhow, we have got values 
   of "y" and "z" for "x", and the values of "x" 
   and "z" for "y" --- all our equations are indeterminate; 
   all our knowledge is relative, even in a narrower sense than is usually implied 
   by the statement. Under the whip of the clown God, our performing donkeys the 
   philosophers and men of science run round and round in the ring; they have amusing 
   tricks: they are cleverly trained; but they get nowhere. </p>
 <p>I don't seem to be getting anywhere myself.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="2">II</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Tp</a> </h4>
 <p>A fresh attempt. Let us look into the simplest and most certain of all possible 
   statements. "Thought exists", or if you will, "Cogitatur". 
 </p>
 <p>Descartes supposed himself to have touched bed-rock with his "Cogito," 
   "ergo Sum." </p>
 <p>Huxley pointed out the complex nature of this proposition, and that it was 
   an enthymeme with the premiss "Omnes sunt, qui cogitant" suppressed. 
   He reduced it to "Cogito;" or, to avoid the assumption of an ego, 
   "Cogitatur." </p>
 <p>Examining more closely this statement, we may still cavil at its form. We cannot 
   translate it into English without the use of the verb to be, so, that, after 
   all, existence is implied. Nor do we readily conceive that contemptuous silence 
   is sufficient answer of the further query, "By whom is it thought?" 
   The Buddhist may find it easy to image an act without an agent; I am not so 
   clever. It may be possible for a sane man; but I should like to know more about 
   his mind before I gave a final opinion. </p>
 <p>But apart from purely formal objections, we may still inquire: Is this "Cogitatur" 
   true? </p>
 <p>Yes; reply the sages; for to deny it implies thought; "Negatur" is 
   only a sub-section of "Cogitatur". </p>
 <p>This involves, however, an axiom that the part is of the same nature as the 
   whole; or (at the very least) an axiom that "A" is "A". 
 </p>
 <p>Now, I do not wish to deny that "A" is "A", or may occasionally 
   be "A". But certainly "A is A" is a very different statement 
   to our original "Cogitatur". </p>
 <p>The proof of "Cogitatur", in short, rests not upon itself but upon 
   the validity of our logic; and if by logic we mean (as we should mean) the Code 
   of the Laws of Thought, the irritating sceptic will have many more remarks to 
   make: for it now appears that the proof that "thought exists" depends 
   upon the truth of that which is thought, to say no more. </p>
 <p>We have taken "Cogitatur", to try and avoid the use of "esse;" 
   but "A is A" involves that very idea, and the proof is fatally flawed. 
 </p>
 <p>"Cogitatur" depends on "Est;" and there's no avoiding it.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="3">III</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>Shall we get on any better if we investigate this "Est" --- Something 
   is --- Existence is --- HB:Heh HB:Yod HB:Heh HB:Aleph HB:Resh HB:Shin HB:Aleph 
   HB:Heh HB:Yod HB:Heh HB:Aleph ? </p>
 <p>What is Existence? The question is so fundamental that it finds no answer. 
   The most profound meditation only leads to an exasperating sense of impotence. 
   There is, it seems, no simple rational idea in the mind which corresponds to 
   the word. </p>
 <p>It is easy of course to drown the question in definitions, leading us to further 
   complexity --- but </p>
 <ul>
   <li>
     <ul>
       <li>"Existence is the gift of Divine Providence,"<br>
         "Existence is the opposite of Non-Existence," </li>
     </ul>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>do not help us much! </p>
 <p>The plain "Existence is Existence" of the Hebrews goes farther. It 
   is the most sceptical of statements, in spite of its form. Existence is just 
   existence, and there's no more to be said about it; don't worry! Ah, but there 
   is more to be said about it! Though we search ourselves for a thought to match 
   the word, and fail, yet we have Berkeley's perfectly convincing argument that 
   (so far as we know it) existence must mean "thinking existence" or 
   "spiritual existence". </p>
 <p>Here then we find our "Est" to imply "Cogitatur;" and Berkeley's 
   arguments are "irrefragable, yet fail to produce conviction" (Hume) 
   because the "Cogitatur;" as we have shown, implies "Est". 
 </p>
 <p>Neither of these ideas is simple; each involves the other. Is the division 
   between them in our brain a proof of the total incapacity of that organ, or 
   is there some flaw in our logic? For all depends upon our logic; not upon the 
   simple identity "A is A" only, but upon its whole structure from the 
   question of simple propositions, enormously difficult from the moment when it 
   occurred to the detestable genius that invented "existential import" 
   to consider the matter, to that further complexity and contradiction, the syllogism. 
 </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="4">IV</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>"Thought is" appears then (in the worst case possible, denial) as 
   the conclusion of the premisses: </p>
 <p>There is denial of thought. </p>
 <p>(All) Denial of thought is thought. </p>
 <p>Even formally, 'tis a clumsy monster. Essentially, it seems to involve a great 
   deal beyond our original statement. We compass heaven and earth to make one 
   syllogism; and when we have made it, it is tenfold more the child of mystery 
   than ourselves. </p>
 <p>We cannot here discuss the whole problem of the validity (the surface- question 
   of the logical validity) of the syllogism; though one may throw out the hint 
   that the doctrine of distributed middle seems to assume a knowledge of a Calculus 
   of Infinites which is certainly beyond my own poor attainments, and hardly impregnable 
   to the simple reflection that all mathematics is conventional, and not essential; 
   relative, and not absolute. </p>
 <p>We go deeper and deeper, then, it seems, from the One into the Many. Our primary 
   proposition depends no longer upon itself, but upon the whole complex being 
   of man, poor, disputing, muddle-headed man! Man with all his limitations and 
   ignorance; man --- man! </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="5">V</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>We are of course no happier when we examine the Many, separately or together. 
   They converge and diverge, each fresh hill-toÿ of knowledge disclosing a vast 
   land unexplored; each gain of power in our telescÿes opening out new galaxies; 
   each improvement in our microscoÿes showing us life minuter and more incomprehensible. 
   A mystery of the mighty spaces between molecules; a mystery of the ether-cushions 
   that fend off the stars from collision! A mystery of the fulness of things; 
   a mystery of the emptiness of things! Yet, as we go, there grows a sense, an 
   instinct, a premonition --- what shall I call it? --- that Being is One, and 
   Thought is One, and Law is One --- until we ask What is that One? </p>
 <p>Then again we spin words --- words --- words. And we have got no single question 
   answered in any ultimate sense. </p>
 <p>What is the moon made of? </p>
 <p>Science replies "Green Cheese." </p>
 <p>For our one moon we have now two ideas: </p>
 <p>"Greenness," and "Cheese." </p>
 <p>"Greenness" depends on the sunlight, and the eye, and a thousand 
   other things. </p>
 <p>"Cheese" depends on bacteria and fermentation and the nature of the 
   cow. </p>
 <p>"Deeper, even deeper, into the mire of things!" </p>
 <p>Shall we cut the Gordian knot? shall we say "There is God"? </p>
 <p>What, in the devil's name, is God? </p>
 <p>If (with Moses) we picture Him as an old man showing us His back parts, who 
   shall blame us? The great Question --- "any" question is the great 
   question --- does indeed treat us thus cavalierly, the disenchanted Sceptic 
   is too prone to think! </p>
 <p>Well, shall we define Him as a loving Father, as a jealous priest, as a gleam 
   of light upon the holy Ark? What does it matter? All these images are of wood 
   and stone, the wood and stone of our own stupid brains! The Fatherhood of God 
   is but a human type; the idea of a human father conjoined with the idea of immensity. 
   Two for One again! </p>
 <p>No combination of thoughts can be greater than the thinking brain itself; all 
   we can think of God or say of Him, so long as our words really represent thoughts, 
   is less than the whole brain which thinks, and orders speech. </p>
 <p>Very good; shall we proceed by denying Him all thinkable qualities, as do the 
   heathen? All we obtain is mere negation of thought. </p>
 <p>Either He is unknowable, or He is less than we are. Then, too, that which is 
   unknowable is unknown; and "God" or "There is God" as an 
   answer to our question becomes as meaningless as any other. </p>
 <p>Who are we, then? </p>
 <p>We are Spencerian Agnostics, poor silly, damned Spencerian Agnostics! </p>
 <p>And there is an end of the matter. </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="6">VI</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>It is surely time that we began to question the validity of some of our data. 
   So far our scepticism has not only knocked to pieces our tower of thought, but 
   rooted up the foundation-stone and ground it into finer and more poisonous powder 
   than that into which Moses ground the calf. These golden Elohim! Our calf-heads 
   that brought us not out of Egypt, but into a darkness deeper and more tangible 
   than any darkness of the double Empire of Asar. </p>
 <p>Hume put his little ? to Berkeley's God-!; Buddha his ? to the Vedic Atman-! 
   --- and neither Hume nor Buddha was baulked of his reward. Ourselves may put 
   ? to our own ? since we have found no ! to put it to; and wouldn't it be jolly 
   if our own second ? suddenly straightened its back and threw its chest out and 
   marched off as !? </p>
 <p>Suppose then we accept our scepticism as having destroyed our knowledge root 
   and branch --- is there no limit to its action? Does it not in a sense stultify 
   itself? Having destroyed logic by logic --- if Satan cast out Satan, how shall 
   his kingdom stand? </p>
 <p>Let us stand on the Mount, Saviours of the World that we are, and answer "Get 
   thee behind me Satan!" though refraining from quoting texts or giving reasons. 
 </p>
 <p>Oho! says somebody; is Aleister Crowley here? --- Samson blinded and bound, 
   grinding corn for the Philistines! </p>
 <p>Not at all, dear boy! </p>
 <p>We shall put all the questions that we can put --- but we may find a tower 
   built upon a rock, against which the winds beat in vain. </p>
 <p>Not what Christians call faith, be sure! But what (possibly) the forgers of 
   the Epistles --- those eminent mystics! --- meant by faith. What I call Samadhi 
   --- and as "faith without works is dead," so, good friends, Samadhi 
   is all humbug unless the practitioner shows the glint of its gold in his work 
   in the world. If your mystic becomes Dante, well; if Tennyson, a fig for his 
   trances! </p>
 <p>But how does this tower of Samadhi stand the assault of Question-time? </p>
 <p>Is not the idea of Samadhi just as dependent on all the other ideas --- man, 
   time, being, thought, logic? If I seek to explain Samadhi by analogy, am I not 
   often found talking as if we knew all about Evolution, and Mathematics, and 
   History? Complex and unscientific studies, mere straws before the blast of our 
   hunchback friend! </p>
 <p>Well, one of the buttresses is just the small matter of common sense. </p>
 <p>The other day I was with Dorothy, and, as I foolishly imagined, very cosy: 
   for her sandwiches are celebrated. It was surely bad taste on the part of Father 
   Bernard Vaughan, and Dr. Torrey, and Ananda Metteyya, and Mr. G. W. Foote, and 
   Captain Fuller, and the ghost of Immanuel Kant, and Mr. Bernard Shaw, and young 
   Neuburg, to intrude. But intrude they did; and talk! I never heard anything 
   like it. Every one with his own point of view; but all agreed that Dorothy was 
   non-existent, or if existent, a most awful specimen, that her buns were stale, 
   and her tea stewed; "ergo," that I was having a very poor time of 
   it. Talk! Good God! But Dorothy kept on quietly and took no notice; and in the 
   end I forgot about them. </p>
 <p>Thinking it over soberly, I see now that very likely they were quite right: 
   I can't prove it either way. But as a mere practical man, I intend taking the 
   steamer --- for my sins I am in Gibraltar --- back to Dorothy at the earliest 
   possible moment. Sandwiches of bun and German sausage may be vulgar and even 
   imaginary --- it's the taste I like. And the more I munch, the more complacent 
   I feel, until I go so far as to offer my critics a bite. </p>
 <p>This sounds in a way like the "Interior Certainly" of the common 
   or garden Christian; but there are differences. </p>
 <p>The Christian insists on notorious lies being accepted as an essential part 
   of his (more usually her) system; I, on the contrary, ask for facts, for observation. 
   Under Scepticism, true, one is just as much a house of cards as the other; but 
   only in the philosophical sense. </p>
 <p>Practically, Science is is true; and Faith is foolish. </p>
 <p>Practically, 3 x 1 = 3 is the truth; and 3 x 1 = 1 is a lie; though, sceptically, 
   both statements may be false or unintelligible. </p>
 <p>Practically, Franklin's method of obtaining fire from heaven is better than 
   that of Prometheus or Elijah. I am now writing by the light that Franklin's 
   discovery enabled men to use. </p>
 <p>Practically, "I concentrated my mind upon a white radiant triangle in 
   whose centre was a shining eye, for 22 minutes and 10 seconds, my attention 
   wandering 45 times" is a scientific and valuable statement. "I prayed 
   fervently to the Lord for the space of many days" means anything or nothing. 
   Anybody who cares to do so may imitate my experiment and compare his result 
   with mine. In the latter case one would always be wondering what "fervently" 
   meant and who "the Lord" was, and how many days made "many." 
 </p>
 <p>My claim, too, is more modest than the Christian's. He (usually she) knows 
   more about my future than is altogether pleasant; I claim nothing absolute from 
   my Samadhi --- I know only too well the worthlessness of single-handed observations, 
   even on so simple a matter as a boiling- point determination! --- and as for 
   his (usually her) future, I content myself with mere common sense about the 
   probable end of a fool. </p>
 <p>So that after all I keep my scepticism intact - and I keep my Samadhi intact. 
   The one balances the other; I care nothing for the vulgar brawling of these 
   two varlets of my mind! </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="7">VII</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Tp</a> </h4>
 <p>If, however, you would really like to know what might be said on the soldierly 
   side of the question, I shall endeavour to oblige. </p>
 <p>It is necessary if a question is to be intelligibly put that the querent should 
   be on the same plane as the quesited. </p>
 <p>Answer is impossible if you ask: Are round squares triangular? or Is butter 
   virtuous? or How many ounces go to the shilling? for the "questions" 
   are not really questions at all. </p>
 <p>So if you ask me Is Samadhi real? I reply: First, I pray you, establish a connection 
   between the terms. What do you mean by Samadhi? </p>
 <p>There is a physiological (or pathological; never mind now!) state which I call 
   Samadhi; and that state is as real - in relation to man - as sleep, or intoxication, 
   or death. </p>
 <p>Philosophically, we may doubt the existence of all of these; but we have no 
   grounds for discriminating between them - the Academic Scepticism is a wholesale 
   firm, I hope! - and practically, I challenge you to draw valid distinctions. 
 </p>
 <p>All these are states of the consciousness of man; and if you seek to destroy 
   one, all fall together. </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="8">VIII</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Tp</a> </h4>
 <p>I must, at the risk of appearing to digress, insist upon this distinction between 
   philosoÿhical and practical points of view, or (in Qabalistic language) between 
   Kether and Malkuth. </p>
 <p>In private conversation I find it hard - almost impossible - to get peoÿle 
   to understand what seems to me so very simple a point. I shall try to make it 
   exceptionally clear. </p>
 <p>A boot is an Illusion. </p>
 <p>A hat is an illusion. </p>
 <p>"Therefore," a boot is a hat. </p>
 <p>So argue my friends, not distributing the middle term. </p>
 <p>But this argue I. </p>
 <p>"Therefore" (though it is not a syllogism), all boots and hats are 
   illusions. </p>
 <p>I add: </p>
 <p>To the man in Kether no illusions matter. </p>
 <p>"Therefore:" To the man in Kether neither boots nor hats matter. 
 </p>
 <p>In fact, the man in Kether is out of all relation to these boots and hats. 
 </p>
 <p>You, they say, claim to be a man in Kether (I don't). Why then, do you not 
   wear boots on your head and hats on your feet? </p>
 <p>I can only answer that I the man in Kether ('tis but an argument) am out of 
   all relation as much with feet and heads as with boots and hats. But why should 
   I (from my exalted pinnacle) stoop down and worry the headed and footed gentleman 
   in Malkuth, who after all doesn't exist for me, by these drastic alterations 
   in his toilet? There is no distinction whatever; I might easily put the boots 
   on his shoulders, with his head on one foot and the hat on the other. </p>
 <p>In short, why not be a clean-living Irish gentleman, even if you do have insane 
   ideas about the universe? </p>
 <p>Very good, say my friends, unabashed, then why not stick to that? Why glorify 
   Spanish gipsies when you have married a clergyman's daughter? </p>
 <p>Why go about proclaiming that you can get as good fun for eighteenpence as 
   usually costs men a career? </p>
 <p>Ah! let me introduce you to the man in Tiphereth; that is, the man who is trying 
   to raise his consciousness from Malkuth to Kether. </p>
 <p>This Tiphereth man is in a devil of a hole! He knows theoretically all about 
   the Kether point of view (or thinks he does) and practically all about the Malkuth 
   point of view. Consequently he goes about contradicting Malkuth; he refuses 
   to allow Malkuth to obsess his thought. He keeps on crying out that there is 
   no difference between a goat and a God, in the hope of hypnotising himself (as 
   it were) into that perception of their identity, which is his (partial and incorrect) 
   idea of how things look from Kether. </p>
 <p>This man performs great magic; very strong medicine. He does really find gold 
   on the midden and skeletons in pretty girls. </p>
 <p>In Abiegnus the Sacred Mountain of the Rosicrucians the Postulant finds but 
   a coffin in the central shrine; yet that coffin contains Christian Rosencreutz 
   who is dead and is alive for evermore and hath the keys of Hell and of Death. 
 </p>
 <p>Ay! your Tiphereth man, child of Mercy and Justice, looks deeper than the skin! 
 </p>
 <p>But he seems a ridiculous object enough both to the Malkuth man and to the 
   Kether man. </p>
 <p>Still, he's the most interesting man there is; and we all must pass through 
   that stage before we get our heads really clear, the Kether-vision above the 
   Clouds that encircle the mountain Abiegnus. </p>
 <h3 align="center"><a name="9">IX</a></h3>
 <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
 <p>Running and returning, like the Cherubim, we may now resume our attempt to 
   drill our hunchback friend into a presentable soldier. The digression will not 
   have been all digression, either; for it will have thrown a deal of light on 
   the question of the limitations of scepticism. </p>
 <p>We have questioned the Malkuth point of view; it appears absurd, be it agreed. 
   But the Tiphereth position is unshaken; Tiphereth needs no telling that Malkuth 
   is absurd. When we turn our artillery against Tiphereth, that too crumbles; 
   but Kether frowns above us. </p>
 <p>Attack Kether, and it falls; but the Yetziratic Malkuth is still there .... 
   until we reach Kether of Atziluth and the Infinite Light, and Space, and Nothing. 
 </p>
 <p>So then we retire up the path, fighting rear-guard actions; at every moment 
   a soldier is slain by a hunchback; but as we retire there is always a soldier 
   just by us. </p>
 <p>Until the end. The end? Buddha thought the supply of hunchbacks infinite; but 
   why should not the soldiers themselves be infinite in number? </p>
 <p>However that may be, here is the point; it takes a moment for a hunchback to 
   kill his man, and the farther we get from our base the longer it takes. You 
   may crumble to ashes the dream-world of a boy, as it were, between your fingers; 
   but before you can bring the physical universe tumbling about a man's ears he 
   requires to drill his hunchbacks so devilish well that they are terribly like 
   soldiers themselves. And a question capable of shaking the consciousness of 
   Samadhi could, I imagine, give long odds to one of Frederick's grenadiers. </p>
 <p>It is useless to attack the mystic by asking him if he is quite sure Samadhi 
   is good for his poor health; 'tis like asking the huntsman to be very careful, 
   please, not to hurt the fox. </p>
 <p>The ultimate Question, the one that really knocks Samadhi to pieces, is such 
   a stupendous Idea that it is far more of a ! than all previous !'s whatever, 
   for all its ? form. </p>
 <p>And the name of that Question is Nibbana. </p>
 <p>Take this matter of the soul. </p>
 <p>When Mr. Judas McCabbage asks the Man in the Street why he believes in a soul, 
   the Man stammers out that he has always heard so; naturally McCabbage has no 
   difficulty in proving to him by biological methods that he has no soul; and 
   with a sunny smile each passes on his way. </p>
 <p>But McCabbage is wasted on the philosopher whose belief in a soul rests on 
   introspection; we must have heavier metal; Hume will serve our turn, may be. 
 </p>
 <p>But Hume in his turn becomes perfectly futile, pitted against the Hindu mystic, 
   who is in constant intense enjoyment of his new-found Atman. It takes a Buddha-gun 
   to knock "his" castle down. </p>
 <p>Now the ideas of McCabbage are banal and dull; those of Hume are live and virile; 
   there is a joy in them greater than the joy of the Man in the Street. So too 
   the Buddha-thought, Anatta, is a more splendid conception than the philosopher's 
   Dutch-doll-like Ego, or the rational artillery of Hume. </p>
 <p>This weapon, too, that has destroyed our lesser, our illusionary universes, 
   ever revealing one more real, shall we not wield it with divine ecstasy? Shall 
   we not, too, perceive the inter-dependence of the Questions and the Answers, 
   the necessary connection of the one with the other, so that (just as 0 x ì is 
   an indefinite) we destroy the absolutism of either ? or ! by their alternation 
   and balance, until in our series ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ... ! ? ! ? ... we care nothing 
   as to which may prove the final term, any single term being so negligible a 
   quantity in relation to the vastness of the series? Is it not a series of geometrical 
   progression, with a factor positive and incalculably vast? </p>
 <p>In the light of the whole process, then, we perceive that there is no absolute 
   value in the swing of the pendulum, thought its shaft lengthen, its rate grow 
   slower, and its sweep wider at every swing. </p>
 <p>What should interest us is the consideration of the Point from which it hangs, 
   motionless at the height of things! We are unfavourably placed to observe this, 
   desperately clinging as we are to the bob of the pendulum, sick with our senseless 
   swinging to and fro in the abyss! </p>
 <p>We must climb up the shaft to reach that point --- but --- wait one moment! 
   How obscure and subtle has our simile become! Can we attach any true meaning 
   to the phrase? I doubt it, seeing what we have taken for the limits of the swing. 
   True, it may be that at the end the swing is always 360ø so that the !-point 
   and the ?-point coincide; but that is not the same thing as having no swing 
   at all, unless we make kinematics identical with statics. </p>
 <p>What is to be done? How shall such mysteries be uttered? </p>
 <p>Is this how it is that the true Path of the Wise is said to lie in a totally 
   different plane from all his advance in the path of Knowledge, and of Trance? 
   We have already been obliged to take the Fourth Dimension to illustrate (if 
   not explain) the nature of Samadhi. </p>
 <p>Ah, say the adepts, Samadhi is not the end , but the beginning. You must regard 
   Samadhi as the normal state of mind which enables you to begin your researches, 
   just as waking is the state from which you rise to Samadhi, sleep the state 
   from which you rose to waking. And only from Sammasamadhi --- continuous trance 
   of the right kind --- can you rise up as it were on tiptoe and peer through 
   the clouds unto the mountains. </p>
 <p>Now of course it is really awfully decent of the adepts to take all that trouble 
   over us, and to put it so nicely and clearly. All we have to do, you see, is 
   to acquire Sammasamadhi, and then rise on tiptoe. Just so! </p>
 <p>But there there are the other adepts. Hard at him! Little brother, he says, 
   let us rather consider that as the pendulum swings more and more slowly every 
   time, it must ultimately stp, as soon as the shaft is of infinite length. Good! 
   then it isn't a pendulum at all but a Mahalingam --- The Mahalingam of Shiva 
   ("Namo Shivaya namaha Aum!") which is all I ever thought it was; all 
   you have to do is to keep swinging hard --- I know it's hook-swinging! --- and 
   you get there in the End. Why trouble to swing? First, because you are bound 
   to swing, whether you like it or not; second, because your attention is thereby 
   distracted from those lumbar muscles in which the hook is so very firmly fixed; 
   third, because after all it's a ripping good game; fourth, because you want 
   to get on, and even to seem to progress is better than standing still. A treadmill 
   is admittedly good exercise. </p>
 <p>True, the question, "Why become an Aarhat?" should precede, "How 
   become an Arahat?" but an unbiassed man will easily cancel the first question 
   with "Why not?" --- the How is not so easy to get rid of. Then, from 
   the standpoint of the Arahat himself, perhaps this "Why did I become an 
   Arahat?" and "How did I become an Arahat?" have but a single 
   solution! </p>
 <p>In any case, we are wasting our time --- we are as ridiculous with our Arahats 
   as Herod the Tetrarch with his peacocks! We pose Life with the question Why? 
   and the first answer is: To obtain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy 
   Guardian Angel. </p>
 <p>To attach meaning to this statement we must obtain that Knowledge and Conversation: 
   and when we have done that, we may proceed to the next Question. It is no good 
   asking it now. </p>
 <p>"There are purse-proud, penniless ones who stand at the door of the tavern, 
   and revile the guests." </p>
 <p>We attach little importance to the Reverend Out-at-Elbows, thundering in Bareboards 
   Chapel that the rich man gets no enjoyment from his wealth. </p>
 <p>Good, then. Let us obtain the volume entitled "The Book of the Sacred 
   Magick of Abramelin the Mage"; or the magical writings of that holy illuminated 
   Man of God, Captain Fuller, and carry out fully their instructions. </p>
 <p>And only when we have succeeded, when we have put a colossal ! against our 
   vital ? need we inquire whether after all the soldier is not going to develoÿ 
   spinal curvature. </p>
 <p>Let us take the first step; let us sing: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>"I do not ask to see <br>
     The distant path; one step's enough for me." </li>
 </ul>
 <p>But (you will doubtless say) I pith your ? itself with another ?: Why question 
   life at all? Why not remain "a clean-living Irish gentleman" content 
   with his handicap, and contemptuous of card and pencil? Is not the Buddha's 
   goad "Everything is sorrow" little better than a currish whine? What 
   do I care for old age, disease, and death? I'm a man, and a Celt at that. I 
   spit on your snivelling Hindu prince, emasculate with debauchery in the first 
   place, and asceticism in the second. A weak, dirty, paltry cur, sir, your Gautama! 
 </p>
 <p>Yes, I think I have no answer to that. The sudden apprehension of some vital 
   catastrophe may have been the exciting cause of my conscious devotion to the 
   attainment of Adeptship --- but surely the capacity was there, inborn. Mere 
   despair and desire can do little; anyway, the first impulse of fear was the 
   passing spasm of an hour; the magnetism of the path itself was the true lure. 
   It is as foolish to ask me "Why do you adep?" as to ask God "Why 
   do you pardon?" "C'est son mtier." </p>
 <p>I am not so foolish as to think that my doctrine can ever gain the ear of the 
   world. I expect that ten centuries hence the "nominal Crowleians" 
   will be as pestilent and numerous a body as the "nominal Christians" 
   are to-day; for (at present) I have been able to devise no mechanism for excluding 
   them. Rather, perhaps, should I seek to find them a niche in the shrine, just 
   as Hinduism provides alike for those capable of the Upanishads and those whose 
   intelligence hardly reaches to the Tantras. In short, one must abandon the reality 
   of religion for a sham, so that the religion may be universal enough for those 
   few who are capable of its reality to nestle to its breast, and nurse their 
   nature on its starry milk. But we anticipate! </p>
 <p>My message is then twofold; to the greasy "bourgeois" I preach discontent; 
   I shock him, I stagger him, I cut away earth from under his feet, I turn him 
   upside down, I give him hashish and make him run amok, I twitch his buttocks 
   with the red-hot tongs of my Sadistic fancy -- until he feels uncomfortable. 
 </p>
 <p>But to the man who is already as uneasy as St. Lawrence on his silver grill, 
   who feels the spirit stir in him, even as a woman feels, and sickens at, the 
   first leap of the babe in her womb, to him I bring the splendid vision, the 
   perfume and the glory, the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. 
   And to whosoever hath attained that height will I put a further Question, announce 
   a further Glory. </p>
 <p>It is my misfortune and not my fault that I am bound to deliver this elementary 
   Message. </p>
 <ul>
   <li>"Man has two sides; one to face the world with, 
     <p>One to show a woman when he loves her." </p>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>We must pardon Browning his bawdy jest; for his truth is ower true! But it 
   is your own fault if you are the world instead of the beloved; and only see 
   of me what Moses saw of God! </p>
 <p>It is disgusting to have to spend one's life jetting dirt in the face of the 
   British public in the hope that in washing it they may wash off the acrid grease 
   of their commercialism, the saline streaks of their hypocritical tears, the 
   putrid perspiration of their morality, the dribbling slobber of their sentimentality 
   and their religion. And they don't wash it! ... </p>
 <p>But let us take a less unpleasing metaphor, the whip! As some schoolboy poet 
   repeatedly wrote, his rimes as poor as Edwin Arnold, his metre as erratic and 
   as good as Francis Thompson, his good sense and frank indecency a match for 
   Browning! </p>
 <ul>
   <li>"Can't be helped; must be done --- 
     <p>So ..." </p>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Nay! 'tis a bad, bad rime. </p>
 <p>And only after the scourge that smites shall come the rod that consoles, if 
   I may borrow a somewhat daring simile from Abdullah Haji of Shiraz and the twenty-third 
   Psalm. </p>
 <p>Well, I would much prefer to spend my life at the rod; it is wearisome and 
   loathsome to be constantly flogging the tough hide of Britons, whom after all 
   I love. "Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son that 
   He receiveth." I shall really be glad if a few of you will get it over, 
   and come and sit on daddy's knee! </p>
 <p>The first step is the hardest; make a start, and I will soon set the hunchback 
   lion and the soldier unicorn fighting for your crown. And they shall lie down 
   together at the end, equally glad, equally weary; while sole and sublime that 
   crown of thine (brother!) shall glitter in the frosty Void of the abyss, its 
   twelve stars filling that silence and solitude with a music and a motion that 
   are more silent and more still than they; thou shalt sit throned on the Invisible, 
   thine eyes fixed upon That which we call Nothing, because it is beyond Everything 
   attainable by thought, or trance, thy right hand gripping the azure rod of Light, 
   thy left hand clasped upon the scarlet scourge of Death; thy body girdled with 
   a snake more brilliant than the sun, its name Eternity; thy mouth curved moonlike 
   in a smile, in the invisible kiss of Nuit, our Lady of the Starry Abodes; thy 
   body's electric flesh stilled by sheer might to a movement closed upon itself 
   in the controlled fury of Her love --- nay, beyond all these Images art thou 
   (little brother!) who art passed from I and Thou, and He unto That which hath 
   no Name, no Image. ... </p>
 <p>Little brother, give me thy hand; for the first step is hard. </p>
 <p>ALEISTER CROWLEY.</p>
