 0. In the name of the Lord of Initiation, Amen. 
 <p> 1. I fly and I alight as an hawk: of mother-of-emerald are my mighty-sweeping 
   wings. 
 </p><p> 2. I swoop down upon the black earth; and it gladdens into green at my coming. 
 </p><p> 3. Children of Earth! rejoice! rejoice exceedingly; for your salvation is 
   at hand. 
 </p><p> 4. The end of sorrow is come; I will ravish you away into mine unutterable 
   joy. 
 </p><p> 5. I will kiss you, and bring you to the bridal: I will spread a feast before 
   you in the house of happiness. 
 </p><p> 6. I am not come to rebuke you, or to enslave you. 
 </p><p> 7. I bid you not turn from your voluptuous ways, from your idleness, from 
   your follies. 
 </p><p> 8. But I bring you joy to your pleasure, peace to your languor, wisdom to 
   your folly. 
 </p><p> 9. All that ye do is right, if so be that ye enjoy it. 
 </p><p> 10. I am come against sorrow, against weariness, against them that seek to 
   enslave you. 
 </p><p> 11. I pour you lustral wine, that giveth you delight both at the sunset and 
   the dawn. 
 </p><p> 12. Come with me, and I will give you all that is desirable upon the earth. 
 </p><p> 13. Because I give you that of which Earth and its joys are but as shadows. 
 </p><p> 14. They flee away, but my joy abideth even unto the end. 
 </p><p> 15. I have hidden myself beneath a mask: I am a black and terrible God. 
 </p><p> 16. With courage conquering fear shall ye approach me: ye shall lay down your 
   heads upon mine altar, expecting the sweep of the sword. 
 </p><p> 17. But the first kiss of love shall be radiant on your lips; and all my darkness 
   and terror shall turn to light and joy. 
 </p><p> 18. Only those who fear shall fail. Those who have bent their backs to the 
   yoke of slavery until they can no longer stand upright; them will I despise. 
 </p><p> 19. But you who have defied the law; you who have conquered by subtlety or 
   force; you will I take unto me, even I will take you unto me. 
 </p><p> 20. I ask you to sacrifice nothing at mine altar; I am the God who giveth 
   all. 
 </p><p> 21. Light, Life, Love; Force, Fantasy, Fire; these do I bring you: mine hands 
   are full of these. 
 </p><p> 22. There is joy in the setting-out; there is joy in the journey; there is 
   joy in the goal. 
 </p><p> 23. Only if ye are sorrowful, or weary, or angry, or discomforted; then ye 
   may know that ye have lost the golden thread, the thread wherewith I guide you 
   to the heart of the groves of Eleusis. 
 </p><p> 24. My disciples are proud and beautiful; they are strong and swift; they 
   rule their way like mighty conquerors. 
 </p><p> 25. The weak, the timid, the imperfect, the cowardly, the poor, the tearful 
   --- these are mine enemies, and I am come to destroy them. 
 </p><p> 26. This also is compassion: an end to the sickness of earth. A rooting-out 
   of the weeds: a watering of the flowers. 
 </p><p> 27. O my children, ye are more beautiful than the flowers: ye must not fade 
   in your season. 
 </p><p> 28. I love you; I would sprinkle you with the divine dew of immortality. 
 </p><p> 29. This immortality is no vain hope beyond the grave: I offer you the certain 
   consciousness of bliss. 
 </p><p> 30. I offer it at once, on earth; before an hour hath struck upon the bell, 
   ye shall be with Me in the Abodes that are beyond Decay. 
 </p><p> 31. Also I give you power earthly and joy earthly; wealth, and health, and 
   length of days. Adoration and love shall cling to your feet, and twine around 
   your heart. 
 </p><p> 32. Only your mouths shall drink of a delicious wine --- the wine of Iacchus; 
   they shall reach ever to the heavenly kiss of the Beautiful God. 
 </p><p> 33. I reveal unto you a great mystery. Ye stand between the abyss of height 
   and the abyss of depth. 
 </p><p> 34. In either awaits you a Companion; and that Companion is Yourself. 
 </p><p> 35. Ye can have no other Companion. 
 </p><p> 36. Many have arisen, being wise. They have said "Seek out the glittering 
   Image in the place ever golden, and unite yourselves with It." 
 </p><p> 37. Many have arisen, being foolish. They have said, "Stoop down unto the 
   darkly splendid world, and be wedded to that Blind Creature of the Slime." 
 </p><p> 38. I who am beyond Wisdom and Folly, arise and say unto you: achieve both 
   weddings! Unite yourselves with both! 
 </p><p> 39. Beware, beware, I say, lest ye seek after the one and lose the other! 
 </p><p> 40. My adepts stand upright; their head above the heavens, their feet below 
   the hells. 
 </p><p> 41. But since one is naturally attracted to the Angel, another to the Demon, 
   let the first strengthen the lower link, the last attach more firmly to the 
   higher. 
 </p><p> 42. Thus shall equilibrium become perfect. I will aid my disciples; as fast 
   as they acquire this balanced power and joy so faster will I push them. 
 </p><p> 43. They shall in their turn speak from this Invisible Throne; their words 
   shall illumine the worlds. 
 </p><p> 44. They shall be masters of majesty and might; they shall be beautiful and 
   joyous; they shall be clothed with victory and splendour; they shall stand upon 
   the firm foundation; the kingdom shall be theirs; yea, the kingdom shall be 
   theirs. 
 </p><p> In the name of the Lord of Initiation. Amen.
