   <li>Into my loneliness comes - 
   </li><li>The sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the uttermost hills. 
   </li><li>Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wilderness. 
   </li><li>And I behold Pan. 
   </li><li>The snows are eternal above, above - 
   </li><li>And their perfume smokes upward into the nostrils of the stars. 
   </li><li>But what have I to do with these? 
   </li><li>To me only the distant flute, the abiding vision of Pan. 
   </li><li>On all sides Pan to the eye, to the ear; 
   </li><li>The perfume of Pan pervading, the taste of him utterly filling my mouth, 
     so that the tongue breaks forth into a weird and monstrous speech. 
   </li><li>The embrace of him intense on every centre of pain and pleasure. 
   </li><li>The sixth interior sense aflame with the inmost self of Him, 
   </li><li>Myself flung down the precipice of being 
   </li><li>Even to the abyss, annihilation. 
   </li><li>An end to loneliness, as to all. 
   </li><li>Pan! Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan! 
 </li></ol>
 <p align="center" class="heading">I</p>
 <ol>
   <li>My God, how I love Thee! 
   </li><li>With the vehement appetite of a beast I hunt Thee through the Universe. 
   </li><li>Thou art standing as it were upon a pinnacle at the edge of some fortified 
     city. I am a white bird, and perch upon Thee. 
   </li><li>Thou art My Lover: I see Thee as a nymph with her white limbs stretched 
     by the spring. 
   </li><li>She lies upon the moss; there is none other but she: 
   </li><li>Art Thou not Pan? 
   </li><li>I am He. Speak not, O my God! Let the work be accomplished in silence. 
   </li><li>Let my cry of pain be crystallized into a little white fawn to run away 
     into the forest! 
   </li><li>Thou art a centaur, O my God, from the violet-blossoms that crown Thee to 
     the hoofs of the horse. 
   </li><li>Thou art harder than tempered steel; there is no diamond beside Thee. 
   </li><li>Did I not yield this body and soul? 
   </li><li>I woo thee with a dagger drawn across my throat. 
   </li><li>Let the spout of blood quench Thy blood-thirst, O my God! 
   </li><li>Thou art a little white rabbit in the burrow Night. 
   </li><li>I am greater than the fox and the hole. 
   </li><li>Give me Thy kisses, O Lord God! 
   </li><li>The lightning came and licked up the little flock of sheep. 
   </li><li>There is a tongue and a flame; I see that trident walking over the sea. 
   </li><li>A phoenix hath it for its head; below are two prongs. They spear the wicked. 
   </li><li>I will spear Thee, O Thou little grey god, unless Thou beware! 
   </li><li>From the grey to the gold; from the gold to that which is beyond the gold 
     of Ophir. 
   </li><li>My God! but I love Thee! 
   </li><li>Why hast Thou whispered so ambiguous things? Wast Thou afraid, O goat-hoofed 
     One, O horned One, O pillar of lightning? 
   </li><li>From the lightning fall pearls; from the pearls black specks of nothing. 
   </li><li>I based all on one, one on naught. 
   </li><li>Afloat in the aether, O my God, my God! 
   </li><li>O Thou great hooded sun of glory, cut off these eyelids! 
   </li><li>Nature shall die out; she hideth me, closing mine eyelids with fear, she 
     hideth me from My destruction, O Thou open eye. 
   </li><li>O ever-weeping One! 
   </li><li>Not Isis my mother, nor Osiris my self; but the incestuous Horus given over 
     to Typhon, so may I be! 
   </li><li>There thought; and thought is evil. 
   </li><li>Pan! Pan! Io Pan! it is enough. 
   </li><li>Fall not into death, O my soul! Think that death is the bed into which you 
     are falling! 
   </li><li>O how I love Thee, O my God! Especially is there a vehement parallel light 
     from infinity, vilely diffracted in the haze of this mind. 
   </li><li>I love Thee. I love Thee. I love Thee. 
   </li><li>Thou art a beautiful thing whiter than a woman in the column of this vibration. 
   </li><li>I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above. 
   </li><li>But it is death, and the flame of the pyre. 
   </li><li>Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my soul! Thy God is like the cold emptiness 
     of the utmost heaven, into which thou radiatest thy little light. 
   </li><li>When Thou shall know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire in Thy 
     great N. O. X. 
   </li><li>What shalt Thou be, my God, when I have ceased to love Thee? 
   </li><li>A worm, a nothing, a niddering knave! 
   </li><li>But Oh! I love Thee. 
   </li><li>I have thrown a million flowers from the basket of the Beyond at Thy feet, 
     I have anointed Thee and Thy Staff with oil and blood and kisses. 
   </li><li>I have kindled Thy marble into life - ay! into death. 
   </li><li>I have been smitten with the reek of Thy mouth, that drinketh never wine 
     but life. 
   </li><li>How the dew of the Universe whitens the lips! 
   </li><li>Ah! trickling flow of the stars of the mother Supernal, begone! 
   </li><li>I Am She that should come, the Virgin of all men. 
   </li><li>I am a boy before Thee, O Thou satyr God. 
   </li><li>Thou wilt inflict the punishment of pleasure - Now! Now! Now! 
   </li><li>Io Pan! Io Pan! I love Thee. I love Thee. 
   </li><li>O my God, spare me! 
   </li><li>Now! It is done! Death. 
   </li><li>I cried aloud the word - and it was a mighty spell to bind the Invisible, 
     an enchantment to unbind the bound; yea, to unbind the bound. 
 </li></ol>
 <p align="center" class="heading">II</p>
 <ol>
   <li>O my God! use Thou me again, alway. For ever! For ever! 
   </li><li>That which came fire from Thee cometh water from me; let therefore Thy Spirit 
     lay hold on me, so that my right hand loose the lightning. 
   </li><li>Travelling through space, I saw the onrush of two galaxies, butting each 
     other and goring like bulls upon earth. I was afraid. 
   </li><li>Thus they ceased fight, and turned upon me, and I was sorely crushed and 
     torn. 
   </li><li>I had rather have been trampled by the World-Elephant. 
   </li><li>O my God! Thou art my little pet tortoise! 
   </li><li>Yet Thou sustainest the World-Elephant. 
   </li><li>I creep under Thy carapace, like a lover into the bed of his beautiful; 
     I creep in, and sit in Thine heart, as cubby and cosy as may be. 
   </li><li>Thou shelterest me, that I hear not the trumpeting of that World-Elephant. 
   </li><li>Thou art not worth an obol in the agora; yet Thou art not to be bought at 
     the ransom of the whole Universe. 
   </li><li>Thou art like a beautiful Nubian slave leaning her naked purple against 
     the green pillars of marble that are above the bath. 
   </li><li>Wine jets from her black nipples. 
   </li><li>I drank wine awhile agone in the house of Pertinax. The cup-boy favoured 
     me, and gave me of the right sweet Chian. 
   </li><li>There was a Doric boy, skilled in feats of strength, an athlete. The full 
     moon fled away angrily down the wrack. Ah! but we laughed. 
   </li><li>I was pernicious drunk, O my God! Yet Pertinax brought me to the bridal. 
   </li><li>I had a crown of thorns for all my dower. 
   </li><li>Thou art like a goat's horn from Astor, O Thou God of mine, gnarl'd and 
     crook'd and devilish strong. 
   </li><li>Colder than all the ice of all the glaciers of the Naked Mountain was the 
     wine it poured for me. 
   </li><li>A wild country and a waning moon Clouds scudding over the sky. A circuit 
     of pines, and of tall yews beyond. Thou in the midst! 
   </li><li>O all ye toads and cats, rejoice! Ye slimy things, come hither! 
   </li><li>Dance, dance to the Lord our God! 
   </li><li>He is he! He is he! He is he! 
   </li><li>Why should I go on? 
   </li><li>Why? Why? comes the sudden cackle of a million imps of hell. 
   </li><li>And the laughter runs. 
   </li><li>But sickens not the Universe; but shakes not the stars. 
   </li><li>God! how I love Thee! 
   </li><li>I am walking in an asylum; all the men and women about me are insane. 
   </li><li>Oh madness! madness! madness! desirable art thou! 
   </li><li>But I love Thee, O God! 
   </li><li>These men and women rave and howl; they froth out folly. 
   </li><li>I begin to be afraid. I have no check; I am alone. Alone. Alone. 
   </li><li>Think, O God, how I am happy in Thy love. 
   </li><li>O marble Pan! O false leering face! I love Thy dark kisses, bloody and stinking! 
     O marble Pan! Thy kisses are like sunlight on the blue Aegean; their blood 
     is the blood of the sunset over Athens; their stink is like a garden of Roses 
     of Macedonia. 
   </li><li>I dreamt of sunset and roses and vines; Thou wast there, O my God, Thou 
     didst habit Thyself as an Athenian courtesan, and I loved Thee. 
   </li><li>Thou art no dream, O Thou too beautiful alike for sleep and waking! 
   </li><li>I disperse the insane folk of the earth; I walk alone with my little puppets 
     in the garden. 
   </li><li>I am Gargantuan great; yon galaxy is but the smoke-ring of mine incense. 
   </li><li>Burn Thou strange herbs, O God! 
   </li><li>Brew me a magic liquor, boys, with your glances! 
   </li><li>The very soul is drunken. 
   </li><li>Thou art drunken, O my God, upon my kisses. 
   </li><li>The Universe reels; Thou hast looked upon it. 
   </li><li>Twice, and all is done. 
   </li><li>Come, O my God, and let us embrace! 
   </li><li>Lazily, hungrily, ardently, patiently; so will I work. 
   </li><li>There shall be an End. 
   </li><li>O God! O God! 
   </li><li>I am a fool to love Thee; Thou art cruel, Thou withholdest Thyself. 
   </li><li>Come to me now! I love Thee! I love Thee! 
   </li><li>O my darling, my darling - Kiss me! Kiss me! Ah! but again. 
   </li><li>Sleep, take me! Death, take me! This life is too full; it pains, it slays, 
     it suffices. 
   </li><li>Let me go back into the world; yea, back into the world. 
 </li></ol>
 <p align="center" class="heading">III</p>
 <ol>
   <li>I was the priest of Ammon-Ra in the temple of Ammon-Ra at Thebai. 
   </li><li>But Bacchus came singing with his troops of vine-clad girls, of girls in 
     dark mantles; and Bacchus in the midst like a fawn! 
   </li><li>God! how I ran out in my rage and scattered the chorus! 
   </li><li>But in my temple stood Bacchus as the priest of Ammon-Ra. 
   </li><li>Therefore I went wildly with the girls into Abyssinia; and there we abode 
     and rejoiced. 
   </li><li>Exceedingly; yea, in good sooth! 
   </li><li>I will eat the ripe and the unripe fruit for the glory of Bacchus. 
   </li><li>Terraces of ilex, and tiers of onyx and opal and sardonyx leading up to 
     the cool green porch of malachite. 
   </li><li>Within is a crystal shell, shaped like an oyster - O glory of Priapus! O 
     beatitude of the Great Goddess! 
   </li><li>Therein is a pearl. 
   </li><li>O Pearl! thou hast come from the majesty of dread Ammon-Ra. 
   </li><li>Then I the priest beheld a steady glitter in the heart of the pearl. 
   </li><li>So bright we could not look! But behold! a blood-red rose upon a rood of 
     glowing gold! 
   </li><li>So I adored the God. Bacchus! thou art the lover of my God! 
   </li><li>I who was priest of Ammon-Ra, who saw the Nile flow by for many moons, for 
     many, many moons, am the young fawn of the grey land. 
   </li><li>I will set up my dance in your conventicles, and my secret loves shall be 
     sweet among you. 
   </li><li>Thou shalt have a lover among the lords of the grey land. 
   </li><li>This shall he bring unto thee, without which all is in vain; a man's life 
     spilt for thy love upon My Altars. 
   </li><li>Amen. 
   </li><li>Let it be soon, O God, my God! I ache for Thee, I wander very lonely among 
     the mad folk, in the grey land of desolation. 
   </li><li>Thou shalt set up the abominable lonely Thing of wickedness. Oh joy! to 
     lay that corner-stone! 
   </li><li>It shall stand erect upon the high mountain; only my God shall commune with 
     it. 
   </li><li>I will build it of a single ruby; it shall be seen from afar off. 
   </li><li>Come! let us irritate the vessels of the earth: they shall distil strange 
     wine. 
   </li><li>It grows under my hand: it shall cover the whole heaven. 
   </li><li>Thou art behind me: I scream with a mad joy. 
   </li><li>Then said Ithuriel the strong; let Us also worship this invisible marvel! 
   </li><li>So did they, and the archangels swept over the heaven. 
   </li><li>Strange and mystic, like a yellow priest invoking mighty flights of great 
     grey birds from the North, so do I stand and invoke Thee! 
   </li><li>Let them obscure not the sun with their wings and their clamour! 
   </li><li>Take away form and its following! 
   </li><li>I am still. 
   </li><li>Thou art like an osprey among the rice, I am the great red pelican in the 
     sunset waters. 
   </li><li>I am like a black eunuch; and Thou art the scimitar. I smite off the head 
     of the light one, the breaker of bread and salt. 
   </li><li>Yea! I smite - and the blood makes as it were a sunset on the lapis lazuli 
     of the King's Bedchamber. 
   </li><li>I smite! The whole world is broken up into a mighty wind, and a voice cries 
     aloud in a tongue that men cannot speak. 
   </li><li>I know that awful sound of primal joy; let us follow on the wings of the 
     gale even unto the holy house of Hathor; let us offer the five jewels of the 
     cow upon her altar! 
   </li><li>Again the inhuman voice! 
   </li><li>I rear my Titan bulk into the teeth of the gale, and I smite and prevail, 
     and swing me out over the sea. 
   </li><li>There is a strange pale God, a god of pain and deadly wickedness. 
   </li><li>My own soul bites into itself, like a scorpion ringed with fire. 
   </li><li>That pallid God with face averted, that God of subtlety and laughter, that 
     young Doric God, him will I serve. 
   </li><li>For the end thereof is torment unspeakable. 
   </li><li>Better the loneliness of the great grey sea! 
   </li><li>But ill befall the folk of the grey land, my God! 
   </li><li>Let me smother them with my roses! 
   </li><li>Oh Thou delicious God, smile sinister! 
   </li><li>I pluck Thee, O my God, like a purple plum upon a sunny tree. How Thou dost 
     melt in my mouth, Thou consecrated sugar of the Stars! 
   </li><li>The world is all grey before mine eyes; it is like an old worn wine-skin. 
   </li><li>All the wine of it is on these lips. 
   </li><li>Thou hast begotten me upon a marble Statue, O my God! 
   </li><li>The body is icy cold with the coldness of a million moons; it is harder 
     than the adamant of eternity. How shall I come forth into the light? 
   </li><li>Thou art He, O God! O my darling! my child! my plaything! Thou art like 
     a cluster of maidens, like a multitude of swans upon the lake. 
   </li><li>I feel the essence of softness. 
   </li><li>I am hard and strong and male; but come Thou! I shall be soft and weak and 
     feminine. 
   </li><li>Thou shalt crush me in the wine-press of Thy love. My blood shall stain 
     Thy fiery feet with litanies of Love in Anguish. 
   </li><li>There shall be a new flower in the fields, a new vintage in the vineyards. 
   </li><li>The bees shall gather a new honey; the poets shall sing a new song. 
   </li><li>I shall gain the Pain of the Goat for my prize; and the God that sitteth 
     upon the shoulders of Time shall drowse. 
   </li><li>Then shall all this which is written be accomplished: yea, it shall be accomplished. 
 </li></ol>
 <p align="center" class="heading">IV</p>
 <ol>
   <li>I am like a maiden bathing in a clear pool of fresh water. 
   </li><li>O my God! I see Thee dark and desirable, rising through the water as a golden 
     smoke. 
   </li><li>Thou art altogether golden, the hair and the eyebrows and the brilliant 
     face; even into the finger-tips and toe-tips Thou art one rosy dream of gold. 
   </li><li>Deep into Thine eyes that are golden my soul leaps, like an archangel menacing 
     the sun. 
   </li><li>My sword passes through and through Thee; crystalline moons ooze out of 
     Thy beautiful body that is hidden behind the ovals of Thine eyes. 
   </li><li>Deeper, ever deeper. I fall, even as the whole Universe falls down the abyss 
     of Years. 
   </li><li>For Eternity calls; the Overworld calls; the world of the Word is awaiting 
     us. 
   </li><li>Be done with speech, O God! Fasten the fangs of the hound Eternity in this 
     my throat! 
   </li><li>I am like a wounded bird flapping in circles. 
   </li><li>Who knows where I shall fall? 
   </li><li>O blessed One! O God! O my devourer! 
   </li><li>Let me fall, fall down, fall away, afar, alone! 
   </li><li>Let me fall! 
   </li><li>Nor is there any rest, Sweet Heart, save in the cradle of royal Bacchus, 
     the thigh of the most Holy One. 
   </li><li>There rest, under the canopy of night. 
   </li><li>Uranus chid Eros; Marsyas chid Olympas; I chid my beautiful lover with his 
     sunray mane; shall I not sing? 
   </li><li>Shall not mine incantations bring around me the wonderful company of the 
     wood-gods, their bodies glistening with the ointment of moonlight and honey 
     and myrrh? 
   </li><li>Worshipful are ye, O my lovers; let us forward to the dimmest hollow! 
   </li><li>There we will feast upon mandrake and upon moly! 
   </li><li>There the lovely One shall spread us His holy banquet. In the brown cakes 
     of corn we shall taste the food of the world, and be strong. 
   </li><li>In the ruddy and awful cup of death we shall drink the blood of the world, 
     and be drunken! 
   </li><li>Ohe! the song to Iao, the song to Iao! 
   </li><li>Come, let us sing to thee, Iacchus invisible, Iacchus triumphant, Iacchus 
     indicible! 
   </li><li>Iacchus, O Iacchus, O Iacchus, be near us! 
   </li><li>Then was the countenance of all time darkened, and the true light shone 
     forth. 
   </li><li>There was also a certain cry in an unknown tongue, whose stridency troubled 
     the still waters of my soul, so that my mind and my body were healed of their 
     disease, self-knowledge. 
   </li><li>Yea, an angel troubled the waters. 
   </li><li>This was the cry of Him: IIIOOShBThIO-IIIIAMAMThIBI-II. 
   </li><li>Nor did I sing this for a thousand times a night for a thousand nights before 
     Thou camest, O my flaming God, and pierced me with Thy spear. Thy scarlet 
     robe unfolded the whole heavens, so that the Gods said: All is burning: it 
     is the end. 
   </li><li>Also Thou didst set Thy lips to the wound and suck out a million eggs. And 
     Thy mother sat upon them, and lo! stars and stars and ultimate Things whereof 
     stars are the atoms. 
   </li><li>Then I perceived Thee, O my God, sitting like a white cat upon the trellis-work 
     of the arbour; and the hum of the spinning worlds was but Thy pleasure. 
   </li><li>O white cat, the sparks fly from Thy fur! Thou dost crackle with splitting 
     the worlds. 
   </li><li>I have seen more of Thee in the white cat than I saw in the Vision of Aeons. 
   </li><li>In the boat of Ra did I travel, but I never found upon the visible Universe 
     any being like unto Thee! 
   </li><li>Thou wast like a winged white horse, and I raced Thee through eternity against 
     the Lord of the Gods. 
   </li><li>So still we race! 
   </li><li>Thou wast like a flake of snow falling in the pine-clad woods. 
   </li><li>In a moment Thou wast lost in a wilderness of the like and the unlike. 
   </li><li>But I beheld the beautiful God at the back of the blizzard - and Thou wast 
     He! 
   </li><li>Also I read in a great book. 
   </li><li>On ancient skin was written in letters of gold: Verbum fit Verbum. 
   </li><li>Also Vitriol and the hierophant's name V.V.V.V.V. 
   </li><li>All this wheeled in fire, in star-fire, rare and far and utterly lonely 
     - even as Thou and I, O desolate soul my God! 
   </li><li>Yea, and the writing<br>
     <img src="images/liber7.gif" alt="Two rows of cryptic glyphs, sixteen in total." width="450" height="138"> 
     It is well.<br>
     This is the voice which shook the earth. 
   </li><li>Eight times he cried aloud, and by eight and by eight shall I count Thy 
     favours, Oh Thou Elevenfold God 418! 
   </li><li>Yea, and by many more; by the ten in the twenty-two directions; even as 
     the perpendicular of the Pyramid - so shall Thy favours be. 
   </li><li>If I number them, they are One. 
   </li><li>Excellent is Thy love, Oh Lord! Thou art revealed by the darkness, and he 
     who gropeth in the horror of the groves shall haply catch Thee, even as a 
     snake that seizeth on a little singing-bird. 
   </li><li>I have caught Thee, O my soft thrush; I am like a hawk of mother-of-emerald; 
     I catch Thee by instinct, though my eyes fail from Thy glory. 
   </li><li>Yet they are but foolish folk yonder. I see them on the yellow sand, all 
     clad in Tyrian purple. 
   </li><li>They draw their shining God unto the land in nets; they build a fire to 
     the Lord of Fire, and cry unhallowed words, even the dreadful curse Amri maratza, 
     maratza, atman deona lastadza maratza maritza - maran! 
   </li><li>Then do they cook the shining god, and gulp him whole. 
   </li><li>These are evil folk, O beautiful boy! let us pass on to the Otherworld. 
   </li><li>Let us make ourselves into a pleasant bait, into a seductive shape! 
   </li><li>I will be like a splendid naked woman with ivory breasts and golden nipples; 
     my whole body shall be like the milk of the stars. I will be lustrous and 
     Greek, a courtesan of Delos, of the unstable Isle. 
   </li><li>Thou shalt be like a little red worm on a hook. 
   </li><li>But thou and I will catch our fish alike. 
   </li><li>Then wilt thou be a shining fish with golden back and silver belly: I will 
     be like a violent beautiful man, stronger than two score bulls, a man of the 
     West bearing a great sack of precious jewels upon a staff that is greater 
     than the axis of the all. 
   </li><li>And the fish shall be sacrificed to Thee and the strong man crucified for 
     Me, and Thou and I will kiss, and atone for the wrong of the Beginning; yea, 
     for the wrong of the beginning.

   <li>O my beautiful God! I swim in Thy heart like a trout in the mountain torrent. 
   </li><li>I leap from pool to pool in my joy; I am goodly with brown and gold and 
     silver. 
   </li><li>Why, I am lovelier than the russet autumn woods at the first snowfall. 
   </li><li>And the crystal cave of my thought is lovelier than I. 
   </li><li>Only one fish-hook can draw me out; it is a woman kneeling by the bank of 
     the stream. It is she that pours the bright dew over herself, and into the 
     sand so that the river gushes forth. 
   </li><li>There is a bird on yonder myrtle; only the song of that bird can draw me 
     out of the pool of Thy heart, O my God! 
   </li><li>Who is this Neapolitan boy that laughs in his happiness? His lover is the 
     mighty crater of the Mountain of Fire. I saw his charred limbs borne down 
     the slopes in a stealthy tongue of liquid stone. 
   </li><li>And Oh! the chirp of the cicada! 
   </li><li>I remember the days when I was cacique in Mexico. 
   </li><li>O my God, wast Thou then as now my beautiful lover? 
   </li><li>Was my boyhood then as now Thy toy, Thy joy? 
   </li><li>Verily, I remember those iron days. 
   </li><li>I remember how we drenched the bitter lakes with our torrent of gold; how 
     we sank the treasurable image in the crater of Citlaltepetl. 
   </li><li>How the good flame lifted us even unto the lowlands, setting us down in 
     the impenetrable forest. 
   </li><li>Yea, Thou wast a strange scarlet bird with a bill of gold. I was Thy mate 
     in the forests of the lowland; and ever we heard from afar the shrill chant 
     of mutilated priests and the insane clamour of the Sacrifice of Maidens. 
   </li><li>There was a weird winged God that told us of his wisdom. 
   </li><li>We attained to be starry grains of gold dust in the sands of a slow river. 
   </li><li>Yea, and that river was the river of space and time also. 
   </li><li>We parted thence; ever to the smaller, ever to the greater, until now, O 
     sweet God, we are ourselves, the same. 
   </li><li>O God of mine, Thou art like a little white goat with lightning in his horns! 
   </li><li>I love Thee, I love Thee. 
   </li><li>Every breath, every word, every thought, every deed is an act of love with 
     Thee. 
   </li><li>The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love. 
   </li><li>The songs of me are the soft sighs: 
   </li><li>The thoughts of me are very rapture: 
   </li><li>And my deeds are the myriads of Thy children, the stars and the atoms. 
   </li><li>Let there be nothing! 
   </li><li>Let all things drop into this ocean of love! 
   </li><li>Be this devotion a potent spell to exorcise the demons of the Five! 
   </li><li>Ah God, all is gone! Thou dost consummate Thy rapture. Falutli! Falutli! 
   </li><li>There is a solemnity of the silence. There is no more voice at all. 
   </li><li>So shall it be unto the end. We who were dust shall never fall away into 
     the dust. 
   </li><li>So shall it be. 
   </li><li>Then, O my God, the breath of the Garden of Spices. All these have a savour 
     averse. 
   </li><li>The cone is cut with an infinite ray; the curve of hyperbolic life springs 
     into being. 
   </li><li>Farther and farther we float; yet we are still. It is the chain of systems 
     that is falling away from us. 
   </li><li>First falls the silly world; the world of the old grey land. 
   </li><li>Falls it unthinkably far, with its sorrowful bearded face presiding over 
     it; it fades to silence and woe. 
   </li><li>We to silence and bliss, and the face is the laughing face of Eros. 
   </li><li>Smiling we greet him with the secret signs. 
   </li><li>He leads us into the Inverted Palace. 
   </li><li>There is the Heart of Blood, a pyramid reaching its apex down beyond the 
     Wrong of the Beginning. 
   </li><li>Bury me unto Thy Glory, O beloved, O princely lover of this harlot maiden, 
     within the Secretest Chamber of the Palace! 
   </li><li>It is done quickly; yea, the seal is set upon the vault. 
   </li><li>There is one that shall avail to open it. 
   </li><li>Nor by memory, nor by imagination, nor by prayer, nor by fasting, nor by 
     scourging, nor by drugs, nor by ritual, nor by meditation; only by passive 
     love shall he avail. 
   </li><li>He shall await the sword of the Beloved and bare his throat for the stroke. 
   </li><li>Then shall his blood leap out and write me runes in the sky; yea, write 
     me runes in the sky.

   <li>Thou wast a priestess, O my God, among the Druids; and we knew the powers 
     of the oak. 
   </li><li>We made us a temple of stones in the shape of the Universe, even as thou 
     didst wear openly and I concealed. 
   </li><li>There we performed many wonderful things by midnight. 
   </li><li>By the waning moon did we work. 
   </li><li>Over the plain came the atrocious cry of wolves. 
   </li><li>We answered; we hunted with the pack. 
   </li><li>We came even unto the new Chapel and Thou didst bear away the Holy Graal 
     beneath Thy Druid vestments. 
   </li><li>Secretly and by stealth did we drink of the informing sacrament. 
   </li><li>Then a terrible disease seized upon the folk of the grey land; and we rejoiced. 
   </li><li>O my God, disguise Thy glory! 
   </li><li>Come as a thief, and let us steal away the Sacraments! 
   </li><li>In our groves, in our cloistral cells, in our honeycomb of happiness, let 
     us drink, let us drink! 
   </li><li>It is the wine that tinges everything with the true tincture of infallible 
     gold. 
   </li><li>There are deep secrets in these songs. It is not enough to hear the bird; 
     to enjoy song he must be the bird. 
   </li><li>I am the bird, and Thou art my song, O my glorious galloping God! 
   </li><li>Thou reinest in the stars; thou drivest the constellations seven abreast 
     through the circus of Nothingness. 
   </li><li>Thou Gladiator God! 
   </li><li>I play upon mine harp; Thou fightest the beasts and the flames. 
   </li><li>Thou takest Thy joy in the music, and I in the fighting. 
   </li><li>Thou and I are beloved of the Emperor. 
   </li><li>See! he has summoned us to the Imperial dais. The night falls; it is a great 
     orgy of worship and bliss. 
   </li><li>The night falls like a spangled cloak from the shoulders of a prince upon 
     a slave. 
   </li><li>He rises a free man! 
   </li><li>Cast thou, O prophet, the cloak upon these slaves! 
   </li><li>A great night, and scarce fires therein; but freedom for the slave that 
     its glory shall encompass. 
   </li><li>So also I went down into the great sad city. 
   </li><li>There dead Messalina bartered her crown for poison from the dead Locusta; 
     there stood Caligula, and smote the seas of forgetfulness. 
   </li><li>Who wast Thou, O Caesar, that Thou knewest God in an horse? 
   </li><li>For lo! we beheld the White Horse of the Saxon engraven upon the earth; 
     and we beheld the Horses of the Sea that flame about the old grey land, and 
     the foam from their nostrils enlightens us! 
   </li><li>Ah! but I love thee, God! 
   </li><li>Thou art like a moon upon the ice-world. 
   </li><li>Thou art like the dawn of the utmost snows upon the burnt-up flats of the 
     tiger's land. 
   </li><li>By silence and by speech do I worship Thee. 
   </li><li>But all is in vain. 
   </li><li>Only Thy silence and Thy speech that worship me avail. 
   </li><li>Wail, O ye folk of the grey land, for we have drunk your wine, and left 
     ye but the bitter dregs. 
   </li><li>Yet from these we will distil ye a liquor beyond the nectar of the Gods. 
   </li><li>There is value in our tincture for a world of Spice and gold. 
   </li><li>For our red powder of projection is beyond all possibilities. 
   </li><li>There are few men; there are enough. 
   </li><li>We shall be full of cup-bearers, and the wine is not stinted. 
   </li><li>O dear my God! what a feast Thou hast provided. 
   </li><li>Behold the lights and the flowers and the maidens! 
   </li><li>Taste of the wines and the cakes and the splendid meats! 
   </li><li>Breathe in the perfumes and the clouds of little gods like wood-nymphs that 
     inhabit the nostrils! 
   </li><li>Feel with your whole body the glorious smoothness of the marble coolth and 
     the generous warmth of the sun and the slaves! 
   </li><li>Let the Invisible inform all the devouring Light of its disruptive vigour! 
   </li><li>Yea! all the world is split apart, as an old grey tree by the lightning! 
   </li><li>Come, O ye gods, and let us feast. 
   </li><li>Thou, O my darling, O my ceaseless Sparrow-God, my delight, my desire, my 
     deceiver, come Thou and chirp at my right hand! 
   </li><li>This was the tale of the memory of Al A'in the priest; yea, of Al A'in the 
     priest. 
 </li></ol>
 <p align="center" class="heading">VII</p>
 <ol>
   <li>By the burning of the incense was the Word revealed, and by the distant 
     drug. 
   </li><li>O meal and honey and oil! O beautiful flag of the moon, that she hangs out 
     in the centre of bliss! 
   </li><li>These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the feet of Osiris, 
     so that the flaming God may rage through the firmament with his fantastic 
     spear. 
   </li><li>But of pure black marble is the sorry statue, and the changeless pain of 
     the eyes is bitter to the blind. 
   </li><li>We understand the rapture of that shaken marble, torn by the throes of the 
     crowned child, the golden rod of the golden God. 
   </li><li>We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mighty 
     sepulchre, and we too answer Olalam! Imal! Tutulu! as it is written in the 
     ancient book. 
   </li><li>Three words of that book are as life to a new aeon; no god has read the 
     whole. 
   </li><li>But thou and I, O God, have written it page by page. 
   </li><li>Ours is the elevenfold reading of the Elevenfold word. 
   </li><li>These seven letters together make seven diverse words; each word is divine, 
     and seven sentences are hidden therein. 
   </li><li>Thou art the Word, O my darling, my lord, my master! 
   </li><li>O come to me, mix the fire and the water, all shall dissolve. 
   </li><li>I await Thee in sleeping, in waking. I invoke Thee no more; for Thou art 
     in me, O Thou who hast made me a beautiful instrument tuned to Thy rapture. 
   </li><li>Yet art Thou ever apart, even as I. 
   </li><li>I remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the year, in the dusk of the 
     Equinox of Osiris, when first I beheld Thee visibly; when first the dreadful 
     issue was fought out; when the Ibis-headed One charmed away the strife. 
   </li><li>I remember Thy first kiss, even as a maiden should. Nor in the dark byways 
     was there another: Thy kisses abide. 
   </li><li>There is none other beside Thee in the whole Universe of Love. 
   </li><li>My God, I love Thee, O Thou goat with gilded horns! 
   </li><li>Thou beautiful bull of Apis! Thou beautiful serpent of Apep! Thou beautiful 
     child of the Pregnant Goddess! 
   </li><li>Thou hast stirred in Thy sleep, O ancient sorrow of years! Thou hast raised 
     Thine head to strike, and all is dissolved into the Abyss of Glory. 
   </li><li>An end to the letters of the words! An end to the sevenfold speech. 
   </li><li>Resolve me the wonder of it all into the figure of a gaunt swift camel striding 
     over the sand. 
   </li><li>Lonely is he, and abominable; yet hath he gained the crown. 
   </li><li>Oh rejoice! rejoice! 
   </li><li>My God! O my God! I am but a speck in the star-dust of ages; I am the Master 
     of the Secret of Things. 
   </li><li>I am the Revealer and the Preparer. Mine is the Sword - and the Mitre and 
     the Winged Wand! 
   </li><li>I am the Initiator and the Destroyer. Mine is the Globe - and the Bennu 
     bird and the Lotus of Isis my daughter! 
   </li><li>I am the One beyond these all; and I bear the symbols of the mighty darkness. 
   </li><li>There shall be a sigil as of a vast black brooding ocean of death and the 
     central blaze of darkness, radiating its night upon all. 
   </li><li>It shall swallow up that lesser darkness. 
   </li><li>But in that profound who shall answer: What is? 
   </li><li>Not I. 
   </li><li>Not Thou, O God! 
   </li><li>Come, let us no more reason together; let us enjoy! Let us be ourselves, 
     silent, unique, apart. 
   </li><li>O lonely woods of the world! In what recesses will ye hide our love? 
   </li><li>The forest of the spears of the Most High is called Night, and Hades, and 
     the Day of Wrath; but I am His captain, and I bear His cup. 
   </li><li>Fear me not with my spearmen! They shall slay the demons with their petty 
     prongs. Ye shall be free. 
   </li><li>Ah, slaves! ye will not - ye know not how to will. 
   </li><li>Yet the music of my spears shall be a song of freedom. 
   </li><li>A great bird shall sweep from the abyss of Joy, and bear ye away to be my 
     cup-bearers. 
   </li><li>Come, O my God, in one last rapture let us attain to the Union with the 
     Many! 
   </li><li>In the silence of Things, in the Night of Forces, beyond the accursed domain 
     of the Three, let us enjoy our love! 
   </li><li>My darling! My darling! away, away beyond the Assembly and the Law and the 
     Enlightenment unto an Anarchy of solitude and Darkness! 
   </li><li>For even thus must we veil the brilliance of our Self. 
   </li><li>My darling! My darling! 
   </li><li>O my God, but the love in Me bursts over the bonds of Space and Time; my 
     love is spilt among them that love not love. 
   </li><li>My wine is poured out for them that never tasted wine. 
   </li><li>The fumes thereof shall intoxicate them and the vigour of my love shall 
     breed mighty children from their maidens. 
   </li><li>Yea! without draught, without embrace: - and the Voice answered Yea! these 
     things shall be. 
   </li><li>Then I sought a Word for Myself; nay, for myself. 
   </li><li>And the Word came: O Thou! it is well. Heed naught! I love Thee! I love 
     Thee! 
   </li><li>Therefore had I faith unto the end of all; yea, unto the end of all.
