 <p>This is a general survey of Masonic origins, history and philosophy.
 It was at one time given to every new Mason in Iowa,
 probably a better choice than <cite><a href="../md/index.htm">Morals and Dogma</a></cite>, which
 is almost three times as long and much more difficult reading.
 This is a scholarly but approachable treatment of Masonry and
 will be enlightening both to practicing Freemasons and a general audience.
 </p>
 <p>
 Newton is a rationalist and deflates claims of an ancient
 origin for Masonry <i>per se</i>; rather he illuminates the
 historical precedents of the group.
 He starts with ancient Egypt, not because he believes that the
 Egyptians had functioning Masonic lodges, but because
 that is where monumental architecture began.
 He covers the ancient mystery religions,
 and the true origin of Masonry in organizations of medieval stone-masons.
 After a period of decline, a London meeting held in 1717
 at the Goose and Gridiron Alehouse
 united the remaining four Lodges of England, and started modern Freemasonry.
 The two-tier organization proliferated
 into three, and then multiple degrees, during the 18th and 19th centuries,
 eventually resulting in modern Freemasonry.
 </p>
 <p>
 Masonry, which had started as an underground
 association of building trade workers,
 evolved into a fraternal group which included
 both members of the English royal family and American revolutionaries.
 Despite his rational stance, Newton is rhapsodic about the progressive
 influence of the Masonic movement and philosophy, both for individuals seeking
 'the lost word', and for society as a whole.
 Newton claims that the world has benefited greatly because
 of the Masonic ideals of liberty, fraternity and equality. 
 <cite>The Builders</cite> tells the Masonic side of this story.
