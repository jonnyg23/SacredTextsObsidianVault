 <p>BROTHER: Being advanced to the second degree of Freemasonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the external qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse.</p>  
 <p>It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Fellow-Craft, you are bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support; and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of your brethren; but in the decision</p>  
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice.</p>  
 <p>The study of the Liberal Arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration; especially the science of Geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful properties of Nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality.</p>  
 <p>Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character, it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order, by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow-Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties.</p>
