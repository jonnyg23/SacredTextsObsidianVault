 <p>THE mode of government observed by the Fraternity will give the best idea of the nature and design of the Masonic Institution.</p>  
 <p>Three classes are established among Masons, under different appellations. The privileges of each class are distinct; and particular means are adopted to preserve those privileges to the just and meritorious.

With them the ancient landmarks of the Order are preserved; and from them we learn the necessary instructive lessons which dignify the Art, and qualify the professors to illustrate its excellence and utility.</p>  
 <p>Such is the established plan of the Masonic System. By this judicious arrangement, true Friendship is cultivated among different ranks of men, Hospitality promoted, Industry rewarded, and Ingenuity encouraged.—PRESTON.</p>
