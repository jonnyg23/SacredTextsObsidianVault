 <p>THIS section fully explains the manner of constituting, and the proper authority for holding a Lodge. Here, also, we learn where Lodges were anciently held; their FORM, SUPPORT, COVERING, FURNITURE, ORNAMENTS, LIGHTS, and JEWELS; how situated, and to whom dedicated, as well in former times as at present.</p>  
 <p>A Lodge is an assemblage of Masons, duly congregated, having the Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses, and a Charter or Warrant, authorizing them to work.</p>
