 <p>Prayer at raising a brother to Master Mason's degree:</p>  
 <p>THOU, O GOD! knowest our down-sitting and our up-rising, and understandeth our thoughts afar off. Shield and defend us from the evil intentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and afflictions we are destined to endure, while traveling through this vale of tears. Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth, and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down, and riseth not up till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, O LORD! have compassion on the children of thy creation; administer them comfort in time of trouble, and save them with an everlasting salvation.—AMEN.</p>
