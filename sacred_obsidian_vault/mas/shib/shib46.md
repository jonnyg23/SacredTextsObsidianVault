 <p>To the Right Eminent Sir </p>  
 <p>Grand Commander of Knights Templar of </p>  
 <p>The undersigned petitioners respectfully represent that they are Knights Templar in good and regular standing, that they have the prosperity of the Order at heart, and that they desire to promote its influence. In order that a greater opportunity may be afforded them for the same, they are desirous of forming a new Commandery, to be located at , and to be known as Commandery, No. . They have nominated and do hereby recommend Sir  to be the first Commander, Sir  to be the first Generalissimo, and Sir  to be the first Captain General of said new Commandery; and they pray for a dispensation empowering them to meet as a regular Commandery at , in the county of , there to discharge the duties of Knights Templar in a constitutional manner.</p>  
 <p>Should the prayer of the petitioners be granted, they promise a strict obedience to the commands of the R. E. Grand Commander, to the statutes and regulations of the Grand Commandery of , the Constitution and laws of the Grand Encampment, as well as to the usages of the Order.</p>  
 <p>Dated,  18</p>  
 <p><small>The petition must be signed by at least <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nine</span> Knights of the Order, and must be recommended by the Commandery nearest to the place where the new Commandery is to be located.</small></p>

 <p>At a stated meeting of  Commandery, No. , held at its Asylum in , on the  day of , 18, the foregoing petition for the formation of a new Commandery at , in  County, was presented and considered; whereupon it was</p>  
 <p><i>Resolved</i>, That in the opinion of this Commandery good reasons exist for the organization of a Commandery at this time at that place, and the same is hereby recommended by this Commandery.

 <p>Done at a Stated Conclave of  Commandery, No. , on the day of , 18, A. O. .</p>

 <p>, Recorder.</p>  <h4 align="center">FORMS FOR TEMPLAR TRIALS.</h4>  
 <p>The important requisites of a Complaint against a Knight Templar are comprehensiveness and clearness. The nature of the offense charged must be clearly defined, and the time, place and circumstances accurately stated, together with the names of the persons who witnessed the commission of the offense. The form of the specification, is important so that there may be no ambiguity. The following is suggested:</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>COMPLAINT.</small></p>  
 <p><i>To the Eminent Commander, Officers and Members of  Commandery, No. ., K. T:</i></p>  
 <p>Sir Knight is hereby charged with immoral and unknightly conduct:</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">First Specification</span>.That the said Sir , on the day of  , 18, at , in the county of , , State of , did .</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>[Carefully and accurately describe the offense committed.]</small></p>  
 <p>in violation of his duty as a Knight Templar, and to the scandal and disgrace of the Order of the Temple.</p>  
 <p><small>There should be a Specification for each distinct offense charged, and all should conclude as above. When all the Specifications are set up, then the Complaint may conclude with these words:</small></p>  
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is therefore demanded, that the said Sir  be dealt with according to the law and usages of Templar Knighthood.</p>  
 <p align="right"></p>  
 <p> this  day of , 18.</p>  
 <p><small>The Complaint thus drawn will be presented in open Commandery, and if the Commandery receives the same the Eminent Commander will appoint a committee to take testimony, unless the Commandery decides by vote to hear the testimony in open Commandery. These facts must be recorded in the minutes. The full Complaint need not be entered upon the minutes, unless the Commandery so directs, but the nature of the charges should be entered.</small></p>  
 <p>The next step is for the Recorder to furnish the accused a complete copy of the Complaint, and its Specifications, and a transcript of the action taken by the Commandery thereon. This form is suggested as the official</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>NOTICE TO THE ACCUSED.</small></p>  
 <p><i>Sir :</i></p>  
 <p>Take notice that the foregoing (or the within) charges were preferred against you at a Stated Conclave of  Commandery, No. , on the  day of, 18, and that the Commandery decided to hear the testimony in open Commandery (or appointed Sir Knights , , , a committee to take testimony). It (or they) will meet for that purpose on the  day of, 18, at , and at  o'clock,  M., at or before which time you are to answer the said charges.</p>  
 <p align="right">Witness our hand, and the seal of the Commandery, this  day of , 18.</p>  
 <p>[<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">seal</span>.]</p>  
 <p>, <i>Recorder</i>.</p>  
 <p><small>These papers may be delivered to the accused in person, or may be mailed to his known address. Great care should be taken to serve these papers in a proper manner. The case should not proceed until service is made, if possible. But if the accused absents himself and purposely avoids service, the delivery of the papers at his home, place of business, or a known place that he resorts, either by personal delivery or through the United States mail, is sufficient.</small></p>  
 <p>The papers having been served, the accused will answer, and he may first object to any or all members of the Commission. The Commandery, or Commander, as the procedure maybe, hears his objection, and if the grounds are valid, may select other Fratres to serve as Commissioners.</p>  
 <p>The accused will answer in his own way, no particular form being of any importance. He may admit and plead extenuating circumstances, or he may deny in part or the whole.</p>  
 <p>At the time appointed to talk the testimony the accused, if he desires to do so, should appear and first file his answer to the charge, and then proceed to the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>taking of the testimony. The accused, either by himself or counsel (the latter must be a Knight Templar), has the right to cross-examine witnesses introduced by the opposite party, and also, when the accuser is through with the testimony in support of the charges, to introduce witnesses in leis defense, the opposite party having the right to cross-examine. The accused may, if he prefer, file the answer with the Recorder before the time fixed for taking testimony.</small></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>ANSWER OF ACCUSED.</small></p>  
 <p>A. B., in person, denies the charges made against him, and every matter and thing contained in the several specifications of the same, and demands trial thereon.</p>  
 <p align="right"></p>  
 <p><small>The answer will vary, of course, according to the facts. One specification may be admitted and another denied, or all of them may be admitted, and matters set up in extenuation or excuse. Assuming that the answer is a denial, the next step, unless the witnesses are in attendance at the request of the parties, is to issue, at the request of both parties, process to secure the attendance of the witnesses. The Commandery, or the Committee, should fix the times of meetings, and meet at such times as will secure a prompt investigation of the matter, and at the same time not require such haste as may do injustice to any.</small></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>SUMMONS FOR WITNESS.</small></p>  
 <p><i>Sir Knight :</i></p>  
 <p>You are hereby summoned and required to attend as a witness before  Commandery, No. , at a meeting to be held at its Asylum, on the  day of , 18. (or before a Special Committee of  Commandery, No. , appointed to take testimony, at a meeting to be held by said Committee, at , on the  day of , 18.), then and there to testify as to charges preferred against Sir Knight , and this you will in no wise omit.</p>  
 <p align="right">, <i>Eminent Commander</i>.</p>  
 <p> this  day of, 18.</p>  
 <p><small>This may be made to answer for several witnesses by inserting their names, and adding the words "and each of you" after the words "you." This summons can be used, of course, for Knights Templar only. Others attend, if at all, before a Committee, and at their option.</small></p>  
 <p>At each meeting of the Commandery (or the Committee) the Recorder of the Commandery, or the Secretary of the Committee, and at its first meeting it should select a Chairman and Secretary, should keep accurate and full minutes of all that transpires on the trial. All motions, exceptions to the competency of testimony, or to the ruling of the Commander or the Committee, should he fully and accurately stated, and the testimony reduced to writing in the exact language of the witness as nearly as may be.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>When the testimony is closed on both sides, if taken before a Committee, a report should be made to the Commandery by the Committee. This report should be filed with the Recorder a sufficient time in advance of a Stated Conclave, to enable him to cause to be summoned all the resident members of the Commandery to attend at the next Stated Conclave. The trial may take place at a Special Conclave called by the Commander for that purpose, but the resident members must be notified of the time and place, and summoned to attend.</small></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>REPORT OF COMMITTEE.</small></p>  
 <p><i>To the Eminent Commander, Officers and Members of  Commandery, No. , K. T.:</i></p>  
 <p>The Committee appointed to take testimony upon the charges preferred against Sir Knight A. B. by Sir Knight C. D. has attended to the duty assigned, and submits herewith, as a part of this report, full minutes of the action of the Committee, as well as the testimony taken.</p>  
 <p> this  day of, 19.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Committee:</i></p>  
 <p align="right"></p>  
 <p align="right"></p>  
 <p align="right"></p>  
 <p><small>Should the accused admit the charges when served upon him, proof of such admission or confession will be all that the Committee is required to have made, and they will make up their minutes and report accordingly.</small></p>  
 <p>If the accused fails to appear and answer the charges, after personal service, the Committee may proceed, after taking proof of such service, to take proof of the charges.</p>  
 <p>When this report is submitted to the Commandery, or the testimony is closed, when taken before the Commandery, the parties concerned may comment thereon. This, of course, is optional. Before proceeding to vote the accused should retire.</p>  
 <p>The Commandery then proceeds to consider the matter in the following manner:</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>FIXING PUNISHMENT.</small></p>  
 <p>"Are the charges sustained?" is the first question, and if decided in the affirmative, the Commandery then proceeds, by vote, to fix the punishment. This is done by putting the question:</p>  
 <p>1st. "Shall the accused be expelled?" If this is decided in the negative;</p>  
 <p>2d. "Shall the accused be indefinitely suspended?" If this is decided in the negative;</p>  
 <p>3d. "Shall the accused be definitely suspended?" If this is decided in the affirmative, then, on motion, the time should be fixed by vote; but if decided in the negative;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>4th. "Shall the accused be reprimanded?" Which, of course, the other questions having been negatived, will be decided in the affirmative, the charges having been sustained, and this being the lightest punishment which can be inflicted. It would be error for a Commandery to sustain the charges, and then refuse to inflict any punishment.</p>  
 <p><small>When the matter is disposed of by the Commandery, the Recorder should at once give notice thereof to the accused.</small></p>  
 <p align="center"><small>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT.</small></p>  
 <p><i>To Sir Knight </i></p>  
 <p>Take notice that the foregoing (or the within) is a copy of the action of  Commandery, No. ., upon the charges preferred against you by , as the same appears of record on the minutes of the Lodge.</p>  
 <p align="right">, <i>Recorder</i>.</p>  
 <p><small>Either party may, within  months from the date of the action of the Commandery, appeal to the Grand Commandery. Notice of the appeal should be given within that time, and the appeal, giving the grounds relied upon, must be filed with the Recorder of the Commandery within  days after notice of appeal, and a copy of the notice and appeal must be forwarded to the Grand Recorder.</small></p>
