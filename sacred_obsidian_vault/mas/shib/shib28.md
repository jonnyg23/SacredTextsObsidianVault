 <p>Simon of Syracuse, a Templar, betrayed his trust to the Saracens. Saladin, despising this Templar's treason, had his head struck off and sent it to the Grand Master of the Templars, who ordered it placed on the top of the longest spear in camp, as a warning to all traitors.</p>  
 <p>The Canadians relate that the head was "placed on a pole, or spire." The Scotch say, "on the point of a spear or pike." The head of one so despicable, if to be elevated at all, should be "placed upon the highest spire of Christendom," as a warning to all traitors.</p>
