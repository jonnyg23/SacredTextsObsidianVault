 <p align="center">__________________</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Knights templar</span> begin the duties of their Asylums with quiet manner and subdued spirit. At the conclusion there should be only pathetic memories of solemn ceremonials. Levity, loud speech, military drill, are not to be encouraged in the ceremonies of Knighthood.</p>  
 <p>The Asylum is suitably arrayed under the direction of the Captain General, who is responsible to the Commander that everything is in readiness, both for the transaction of business and the reception of candidates.</p>

 <p>Each Jurisdiction will conduct this ceremonial according to the Tactics it may have adopted.</p>

 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Across the Lines</span>.      *   *   *</p>  
 <p>This ceremony admits of very little variation. Nevertheless the Grand Encampment permits each Grand Jurisdiction to conduct the same according to the Tactics it may have adopted for its government.</p>  
 <p>The ceremony should be conducted with dignity and precision. A knowledge of the use of the sword is necessary to that dignity and precision; therefore the Sword Exercise should not be neglected by the Commanderies.</p>  
 <p>Commanders will discover a greater precision when the numbers are called by the Captain General.</p>

 <img src="img/04700.jpg"></p>  <h5 align="center">FIRST ANNUNCIATION.</h5>  
 <p>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name (or his name shall be called) Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God With Us</span>. Matt. i: 23.</p>

 <img src="img/starsep.jpg"></p>  <h5 align="center">INSPECTION AND REVIEW,</h5>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_starsep"></a>
 <img src="img/starsep.jpg"></p>  
 <p>If the Commander should desire to have Inspection and Review he will order them here. They will be conducted according to the Tactics of the Jurisdiction.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_starsep"></a>
 <img src="img/starsep.jpg"></p>  <h5 align="center">PRAYER.</h5>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Almighty</span> and Most Merciful Father, send down upon us at this time the dew of thy heavenly grace; forgive our many transgressions; refresh us with the sweetness of thy love, and enrich our hearts with patience and hope. May</p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>we bear each other's burdens here, and may we live together hereafter in that blessed kingdom to which thy glorified Son will<a name="img_04800"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/04800.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table> welcome his disciples. And to thy great and matchless Name shall be all the glory through Jesus Christ, Emmanuel. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amen</span>.  
 <p>Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <i>it is</i> in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p>  
 <p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power; and the glory, forever. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amen</span>.</p>  
 <p><small>Other devotional exercises may occur at this point in the opening.</small></p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_starsep"></a>
 <img src="img/starsep.jpg"></p>  
 <p>The Ss should be given by the entire Commandery, hence it is proper to give them <i>after</i> the Triangle is reduced.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_starsep"></a>
 <img src="img/starsep.jpg"></p>  <h5 align="center">REHEARSAL OF DUTIES.</h5>  
 <p>Each officer being in his station, it is eminently fit and proper that he should rehearse aloud the duties that appertain to his office. He should do so in an attitude of dignified respect.</p>  
 <p>When an officer is addressed he will arise, and salute as directed in the Ritual. After he has replied he will stand fast until the conclusion of the opening ceremonial, or until addressed again.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="img_starsep"></a>

 <img src="img/starsep.jpg"></p>  <h5 align="center">IN SHORT FORM.</h5>  
 <p>A Commandery should always be opened in Full Form. What is worth doing at all is worth doing well. Commanders should not gratify a mere desire to shirk formality. But if circumstances render abbreviation imperatively necessary, then there is a Form that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">must</span> be observed. Under no circumstances shall less than that Essential Form be observed. Commanders will not overlook that Ritual requirement.</p>
