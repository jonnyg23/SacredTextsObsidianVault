 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">So</span> far as known, the foregoing Preface is the last word written by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir George Cooper Connor</span>, the author of this volume. Only a few days later he was forced by disease to the chamber of death, which he never again left until the end came.</p>  
 <p>The expression of his thanks in the last paragraph may therefore be taken as his loving farewell to his brethren; and it is believed that his earnest desire to provide a Monitor that should be complete and helpful to the members of the Order has been fully realized in this new edition of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Shibboleth</span>, to the preparation of which were given the last of his labors on earth.</p>
