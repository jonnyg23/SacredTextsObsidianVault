 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Knights about to be constituted into a Commandery will assemble in the Asylum on the appointed day, and open a Commandery of Knights Templar. The Triangle should be fully equipped, but the Tapers to be unlighted. The Jewels are placed upon a small Table or Altar, in the West, and covered with a white cloth.</small></p>  
 <p>The Commandery opened, the Grand Officers will be received according to the Tactics of the Jurisdiction. When the Grand Officers are in their stations, then</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">G. Mar</span>.Right Eminent Grand Commander, a constitutional number of Knights of the Valiant and Magnanimous Order of the Temple, duly instructed in the sublime mysteries of our Order, having received from the proper authority a Warrant or Charter, authorizing them to hold a regular Commandery of Knights Templar, are now assembled for the purpose of being legally constituted, and having their Officers installed, in due and ancient form.</p>  
 <p>GC.Let the Constituting ceremonies begin. The Choir will render appropriate Music.</p>  
 <p><small><i>The Choir will sing appropriate Music, as chosen</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>GC.Excellent Grand Prelate, read unto us a Lesson.</p>

 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Thee do we bow our hearts in reverence and in trust, gratefully acknowledging Thy mercies and the manifold manifestations of Thy providence and Thy love. And now, as we engage in the solemn services of this occasion, we beseech Thy guidance and direction, that all things may be done to Thy glory and to the advancement of the interests we have in charge. Let Thy grace be upon these Thy servants about to be constituted into an organization founded upon the Christian religion and the practice of the Christian virtues. Give unto them a large appreciation of the mission to which they are called, and an earnest purpose to perform the duties which will henceforth devolve upon them. Enlighten their minds, purify their hearts, and help them to attain that true consecration of soul, which will enable them to bear much fruit to the honor and glory of Thy holy Name.</p>  
 <p>All this we ask, most Merciful Father, through him who is the Resurrection and the Life, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amen</span>.</p>
