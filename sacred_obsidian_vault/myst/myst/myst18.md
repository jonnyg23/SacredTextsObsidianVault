 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p1"></a>We<a name="an_iv.vii-p1.1"></a> must now consider under the general name of Contemplation those  developed states of introversion in which the mystic attains somewhat:  the results and rewards of the discipline of Recollection and Quiet.  If this course of spiritual athletics has done its work, he has now  brought to the surface, trained and made efficient for life, a form of  consciousness—a medium of communication with reality—which  remains undeveloped in ordinary men. Thanks to this faculty, he is now  capable of the characteristic mystic experience: temporary union with  “that spiritual fount closed to all reactions from the world of  sense, where, without witnesses of any kind, God and our Freedom  meet.”   <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">681</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p3"></a>The degrees of Recollection trained the self in  spiritual attention: and at the same time lifted it to a new level of  perception where, by means of the symbol which formed the  gathering-point of its powers, it received a new inflow of life. In  the degrees of Quiet it passed on to a state characterized by a tense  stillness, in which it rested in that Reality at which, as yet, it  dared not look. Now, in Contemplation, it is to transcend alike the  stages of symbol and of silence; and “energize  enthusiastically” on those high levels which are dark to the  intellect but radiant <a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="green">p. 329</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_329"></a> to the heart. We must expect  this contemplative activity to show itself in many different ways and  take many different names since its character will be largely governed  by individual temperament. It appears under the forms which ascetic  writers call “ordinary” and “extraordinary,”  “infused” or “passive” Contemplation; and as  that “orison of union” which we have already discussed.   <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">682</font></a>
     Sometimes, too, it shows itself under those abnormal psycho-physical  conditions in which the intense concentration of the self upon its  transcendental perceptions results in the narrowing of the field of  consciousness to a point at which all knowledge of the external world  is lost, all the messages of the senses are utterly ignored. The  subject then appears to be in a state of trance, characterized by  physical rigidity and more or less complete anaesthesia. These are the  conditions of Rapture or Ecstasy: conditions of which the physical  resemblances to certain symptoms of hysteria have so greatly reassured  the enemies of mysticism.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p5"></a>Rapture and Ecstasy differ from Contemplation proper  in being wholly involuntary states. Rapture, says St. Teresa who  frequently experienced it, is absolutely irresistible; we cannot  hinder it. Whereas the orison of union, which is one of the forms in  which pure Contemplation appears at its highest point of development,  is still controlled to a large extent by the will of the subject, and  “may be hindered, although that resistance be painful and  violent.”   <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">683</font></a>
     There is thus a sharp distinction—a distinction both physical  and psychical—between the contemplative and the ecstatic states:  and we shall do well to avail ourselves of it in examining their  character.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p7"></a>First, then, as to Contemplation proper: what is it?  It is a supreme manifestation of that indivisible “power of  knowing” which lies at the root of all our artistic and  spiritual satisfactions. In it, man’s “made Trinity”  of thought, love, and will, becomes a Unity: and feeling and  perception are fused, as they are in all our apprehensions of beauty,  our best contacts with life. It is an act, not of the Reason, but of  the whole personality working under the stimulus of mystic love.  Hence, its results feed every aspect of that personality: minister to  its instinct for the Good the Beautiful, and the True. Psychologically  it is an induced state, in which the field of consciousness is greatly  contracted: the whole of the self, its conative powers, being sharply  focussed, concentrated upon one thing. We pour ourselves out or, as it  sometimes seems to us,   <i>in</i>    towards this over-powering interest: seem to ourselves to reach it  and be merged with it. Whatever <a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="green">p. 330</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_330"></a> the thing may be,  in this act it is given to us and we   <i>know</i>    it, as we cannot know it by the ordinary devices of thought.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p8"></a>The turning of our attention from that crisp and  definite world of multiplicity, that cinematograph-show, with which  intelligence is accustomed and able to deal, has loosed new powers of  perception which we never knew that we possessed. Instead of sharply  perceiving the fragment, we apprehend, yet how we know not, the solemn  presence of the whole. Deeper levels of personality are opened up, and  go gladly to the encounter of the universe. That universe, or some  Reality hid between it and ourselves, responds to “the true  lovely will of our heart.” Our ingoing concentration is balanced  by a great outgoing sense of expansion, of new worlds made ours, as we  receive the inflow of its life. So complete is the self’s  absorption that it is for the time unconscious of any acts of mind or  will; in technical language, its “faculties are  suspended.” This is the “ligature” frequently  mentioned by teachers of contemplative prayer, and often regarded as  an essential character of mystical states.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p9"></a>Delacroix has described with great subtlety the  psychological character of pure contemplation.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p10"></a>“When contemplation appears,” he says:  “(  <i>a</i>   ) It produces a general condition of indifference, liberty, and peace,  an elevation above the world, a sense of beatitude. The Subject ceases  to perceive himself in the multiplicity and division of his general  consciousness. He is raised above himself. A deeper and a purer soul  substitutes itself for the normal self. (  <i>b</i>   ) In this state, in which consciousness of I-hood and consciousness of  the world disappear, the mystic is conscious of being in immediate  relation with God Himself; of participating in Divinity. Contemplation  installs a method of being and of knowing. Moreover, these two things  tend at bottom to become one. The mystic has more and more the  impression of being that which he knows, and of knowing that which he  is.”   <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">684</font></a>
     Temporally rising, in fact, to levels of freedom, he knows himself  real, and therefore knows Reality.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p12"></a>Now, the object of the mystic’s contemplation is  always some aspect of the Infinite Life: of “God, the one  Reality.” Hence, that enhancement of vitality which artists or  other unselfconscious observers may receive from their communion with  scattered manifestations of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty, is in him  infinitely increased. His uniformly rapturous language is alone enough  to prove this. In the contemplative act, his whole personality,  directed by love and will, transcends the sense-world, casts off its  fetters, and rises to freedom: becoming operative on those high levels  where, says Tauler, “reason cannot <a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="green">p. 331</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_331"></a>  come.” There it apprehends the supra-sensible by immediate  contact, and knows itself to be in the presence of the “Supplier  of true Life.” Such Contemplation—such positive attainment  of the Absolute—is the   <i>whole act</i>    of which the visions of poets, the intuition of philosophers, give us  hints.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p13"></a>It is a brief act. The greatest of the contemplatives  have been unable to sustain the brilliance of this awful vision for  more than a little while. “A flash,” “an  instant,” “the space of an Ave Maria,” they say.  “My mind,” says St. Augustine, in his account of his first  purely contemplative glimpse of the One Reality, “withdrew its  thoughts from experience, extracting itself from the contradictory  throng of sensuous images, that it might find out what that light was  wherein it was bathed. . . . And thus with the flash of one hurried  glance, it attained to the vision of   <i>That Which Is.</i>    And then at last I saw Thy invisible things understood by means of  the things that are made, but I could not sustain my gaze: my weakness  was dashed back, and I was relegated to my ordinary experience,  bearing with me only a loving memory, and as it were the fragrance of  those desirable meats on the which as yet I was not able to  feed.”   <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_684"><font size="1">685</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p15"></a>This fragrance, as St. Augustine calls it, remains for  ever with those who have thus been initiated, if only for a moment,  into the atmosphere of the Real: and this—the immortal and  indescribable memory of their communion with That Which Is—gives  to their work the perfume of the “Inviolate Rose,” and is  the secret of its magic power. But they can never tell us in exact and  human language   <i>what</i>    it was that they attained in their ecstatic flights towards the  thought of God: their momentary mergence in the Absolute Life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p16"></a>“That Which Is,” says St. Augustine;  “The One,” “the Supplier of true Life,” says  Plotinus; “the energetic Word,” says St. Bernard;  “Eternal Light,” says Dante; “the Abyss,” says  Ruysbroeck; “Pure Love,” says St. Catherine of  Genoa—Poor symbols of Perfection at the best. But, through and  by these oblique utterances, they give us the assurance that the  Object of their discovery is one with the object of our quest.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p17"></a>William James considered “ineffability”  and “noetic quality” to be the constant characteristics of  the contemplative experience.   <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_685"><font size="1">686</font></a>
     Those who have seen are quite convinced: those who have not seen, can  never be told. There is no certitude to equal the mystic’s  certitude: no impotence more complete than that which falls on those  who try to communicate it. “Of these most excellent and divine  workings in the soul, when God doth manifest Himself,” <a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_332"></a> says Angela of Foligno, “we can in no wise speak, or  even stammer.”   <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_686"><font size="1">687</font></a>
     Nevertheless, the greater part of mystical literature is concerned  with the attempts of the mystics to share their discoveries. Under a  variety of images, by a deliberate exploitation of the musical and  suggestive qualities of words—often, too, by the help of  desperate paradoxes, those unfailing stimulants of man’s  intuitive power—they try to tell others somewhat of that  veritable country which “eye hath not seen.” Their  success—partial though it be—can only be accounted for  upon the supposition that somewhere within us lurks a faculty, a  spark, a “fine point of spirit” which has known this  country from its birth; which dwells in it, partakes of Pure Being,  and can under certain conditions be stung to consciousness. Then  “transcendental feeling,” waking from its sleep,  acknowledges that these explorers of the Infinite have really gazed  upon the secret plan.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p20"></a>Contemplation is not, like meditation, one simple  state, governed by one set of psychic conditions. It is a general name  for a large group of states, partly governed—like all other  forms of mystical activity—by the temperament of the subject,  and accompanied by feeling-states which vary from the extreme of  quietude or “peace in life naughted” to the rapturous and  active love in which “thought into song is turned.” Some  kinds of Contemplation are inextricably entwined with the phenomena of  “intellectual vision” and “inward voices.” In  others we find what seems to be a development of the  “Quiet”: a state which the subject describes as a blank  absorption, a darkness, or “contemplation <i>in</i>   <i>caligine</i>.” <a name="fr_687"></a><a href="#fn_687"><font size="1">688</font></a>
     Sometimes the contemplative tells us that he passes through this  darkness to the light:   <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="#fn_688"><font size="1">689</font></a>
     sometimes it seems to him that he stays for ever in the  “beneficent dark.”   <a name="fr_689"></a><a href="#fn_689"><font size="1">690</font></a>
     In some cases the soul says that even in the depths of her  absorption, she “knows her own bliss”: in others she only  becomes aware of it when contemplation is over and the  surface-intelligence reassumes the reins.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p24"></a>In this welter of personal experiences, it becomes  necessary to adopt some basis of classification, some rule by which to  distinguish true Contemplation from other introversive states. Such a  basis is not easy to find. I think, however, that there are two marks  of the real condition: (A) The Totality and Givenness of the Object.  (B) Self-Mergence of the subject. These we may safely use in our  attempt to determine its character. <a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="green">p. 333</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_333"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p25"></a>(A) Whatever terms he may employ to describe it, and  however faint or confused his perceptions may be, the mystic’s  experience in Contemplation is the experience of the All, and this  experience seems to him to be   <i>given</i>    rather than attained. It is indeed the Absolute which is revealed to  him: not, as in meditation or vision, some partial symbol or aspect  thereof.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p26"></a>(B) This revealed Reality is apprehended by way of  participation, not by way of observation. The passive receptivity of  the Quiet is here developed into an active, outgoing self-donation,  which is the self’s response to the Divine initiative. By a free  act, independent of man’s effort, God is self-disclosed to the  soul; and that soul rushes out willingly to lose itself in Him. Thus a  “give and take”—a divine osmosis—is set up  between the finite and the Infinite life. That dreadful consciousness  of a narrow and limiting I-hood which dogs our search for freedom and  full life, is done away. For a moment, at least, the independent  spiritual life is achieved. The contemplative is merged in it  “like a bird in the air, like a fish in the sea”: loses to  find and dies to live.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p27"></a>“We must,” says Dionysius the Areopagite,  “be transported wholly out of ourselves and given unto  God.”   <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="#fn_690"><font size="1">691</font></a>
     This is the “passive union” of Contemplation: a temporary  condition in which the subject receives a double conviction of  ineffable happiness and ultimate reality. He may try to translate this  conviction into “something said” or “something  seen”: but in the end he will be found to confess that he can  tell nothing, save by implication. The essential fact is that he was   <i>there:</i>    as the essential fact for the returning exile is neither landscape  nor language, but the homely spirit of place.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p29"></a>“To see and to have seen that Vision,”  says Plotinus in one of his finest passages, “is reason no  longer. It is more than reason, before reason, and after reason, as  also is the vision which is seen. . . . And perhaps we should not here  speak of   <i>sight:</i>    for that which is seen is not discerned by the seer—if indeed  it is possible here to distinguish seer and seen as separate things. .  . .Therefore this vision is hard to tell of: for how can a man  describe as other than himself that which, when he discerned it,  seemed not other, but one with himself indeed?”   <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="#fn_691"><font size="1">692</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p31"></a>Ruysbroeck, who continued in the mediaeval world the  best traditions of Neoplatonic mysticism, also describes a condition  of supreme insight, a vision of Truth, which is closely related to the  Plotinian ecstasy. “Contemplation,” he says, “places  us in a purity and a radiance which is far above our understanding . .  . and none can attain to it by knowledge, by subtlety, or by any  exercise whatsoever: but he whom God chooses to unite to <a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_334"></a> Himself, and to illuminate by Himself, he and no other can  contemplate God. . . . But few men attain to this divine  contemplation, because of our incapacity and of the hiddenness of that  light in which one sees. And this is why none by his own knowledge, or  by subtle consideration, will ever really understand these things. For  all words and all that one can learn or understand in a creaturely  way, are foreign to the truth that I mean and far below it. But he who  is united to God, and illumined by this truth—he can understand  Truth by Truth.   <a name="fr_692"></a><a href="#fn_692"><font size="1">693</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p33"></a>This final, satisfying knowledge of reality—this  understanding of Truth by Truth—is, at bottom, that which all  men desire. The saint’s thirst for God, the philosopher’s  passion for the Absolute; these are nothing else than the crying need  of the spirit, variously expressed by the intellect and by the heart.  The guesses of science, the diagrams of metaphysics, the intuitions of  artists; all are pressing towards this. “Adam sinned when he  fell from Contemplation. Since then, there has been division in  man.”   <a name="fr_693"></a><a href="#fn_693"><font size="1">694</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p35"></a>Man’s soul, says Hilton, “Feeleth well  that there is somewhat above itself that it knoweth not nor hath not  yet, but it would have it, and burningly yearneth for it. And that is  nought else but the sight of Jerusalem without-forth, the which is  like to a city that the prophet Ezechiel saw in his visions.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p36"></a>“He saith that he saw a city set upon an hill  sloping to the south, that to his sight when it was measured was no  more of length and of breadth than a rood, that was six cubits and a  palm of length; but as soon as he was brought into the city and looked  about him, then thought him that it was wonder mickle, for he saw many  halls and chambers both open and privy, he saw gates and porches,  outward and inward, and mickle more building than I say now, on length  and on breadth many hundred cubits. Then was this wonder to him, how  this city within was so long and so large, that was so little to his  sight when he was without. This city betokeneth the perfect love of  God, set in the hill of contemplation; the which unto the sight of a  soul that is without the feeling of it and travaileth in desire  toward, seemeth somewhat, but it seemeth but a little thing, no more  than a rood, that is six cubits and a palm in length. By six cubits is  understood the perfection of man’s work, by the palm a little  touching of contemplation. He seeth well that there is such a thing,  that passeth the desert of all working of man a little, as the palm  passeth over the six cubits, but he seeth not within what that is.  Nevertheless, <a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="green">p. 335</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_335"></a> if he may come within the city of  contemplation, then seeth he mickle more than he saw first.”   <a name="fr_694"></a><a href="#fn_694"><font size="1">695</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p38"></a>As in the case of vision, so here, all that we who  “without the feeling travail in desire” can really know  concerning Contemplation—its value for life, the knowledge it  confers—must come from those who have “come within the  city”: have, in the metaphor of Plotinus, “taken flight  towards the Thought of God.” What, in effect, can they tell us  about the knowledge of reality which they attained in that brief  communion with the Absolute?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p39"></a>They tell us chiefly, when we come to collate their  evidence, two apparently contradictory things. They speak, almost in  the Same breath, of an exceeding joy, a Beatific Vision, an intense  communion, and a “loving sight”: and of an exceeding  emptiness, a barren desert, an unfathomable Abyss, a nescience, a  Divine Dark. Again and again these pairs of opposites occur in all  first-hand descriptions of pure contemplation: Remoteness and  Intimacy, Darkness and Light. Bearing in mind that these four  metaphors all describe the same process seen “through a  temperament,” and represent the reaction of that temperament  upon Absolute Reality, we may perhaps by their comparison obtain some  faint idea of the totality of that indescribable experience at which  they hint.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p40"></a>Note first that the emotional accompaniments of his  perceptions will always and necessarily be the stuff from which the  mystic draws suggestive language, by which to hint at his experience  of supernal things. His descriptions will always lean to the  impressionistic rather than to the scientific side. The “deep  yet dazzling darkness,” the “unfathomable abyss,”  the Cloud of Unknowing, the “embrace of the Beloved,” all  represent, not the Transcendent but his relation with the  Transcendent; not an object observed, but an overwhelming impression  felt, by the totality of his being during his communion with a Reality  which is One.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p41"></a>It is not fair, however, to regard Contemplation on  this account as pre-eminently a “feeling state”; and hence  attribute to it, as many modern writers do, a merely subjective  validity. It is of course accompanied, as all humanity’s supreme  and vital acts are accompanied, by feeling of an exalted kind: and  since such emotions are the least abnormal part of it, they are the  part which the subject finds easiest to describe. These elusive  combinations of Fear, Amazement, Desire, and Joy are more or less  familiar to him. The accidents of sensual life have developed them.  His language contains words which are capable of <a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="green">p. 336</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_336"></a>  suggesting them to other men. But his total experience transcends mere  feeling, just as it transcends mere intellect. It is a complete act of  perception, inexpressible by these departmental words: and its agent  is the   <i>whole man,</i>    the indivisible personality whose powers and nature are only  partially hinted at in such words as Love, Thought, or Will.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p42"></a>The plane of consciousness, however—the  objective somewhat—of which this personality becomes aware in  contemplation, is not familiar to it; neither is it related to its  systems of thought. Man, accustomed to dwell amongst spatial images  adapted to the needs of daily life, has no language that will fit it.  So, a person hearing for the first time some masterpiece of classical  music, would have no language in which to describe it objectively; but  could only tell us how it made him   <i>feel.</i>    This is one reason why feeling-states seem to preponderate in all  descriptions of the mystic act. Earthly emotions provide a parallel  which enables the subject to tell us by implication something of that  which he felt: but he cannot describe to us—for want of  standards of comparison—that Wholly Other which induced him thus  to feel. His best efforts to fit words to this elusive but objective  experience generally result in the evaporation alike of its fragrance  and of its truth. As St. Augustine said of Time, he knows what it is  until he is asked to define it.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p43"></a>How symbolic and temperamental is all verbal  description of mystical activity, may be seen by the aspect which  contemplation took in the music-loving soul of Richard Rolle; who  always found his closest parallels with Reality, not in the concepts  of intimate union, or of self-loss in the Divine Abyss, but in the  idea of the soul’s participation in a supernal  harmony—that sweet minstrelsy of God in which “thought  into song is turned.” “To me,” he says, “it  seems that contemplation is joyful song of God’s love taken in  mind, with sweetness of angels’ praise. This is jubilation, that  is the end of perfect prayer and high devotion in this life. This is  that mirth in mind, had ghostily by the lover everlastingly, with  great voice outbreaking. . . . Contemplative sweetness not without  full great labour is gotten, and with joy untold it is possessed.  Forsooth, it is not man’s merit but God’s gift; and yet  from the beginning to this day never might man be ravished in  contemplation of Love Everlasting, but if he before parfitely all the  world’s vanity had forsaken.”   <a name="fr_695"></a><a href="#fn_695"><font size="1">696</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p45"></a>We must, then, be prepared to accept, sift, and use  many different descriptions of evoked emotion in the course of our  inquiry into the nature of the contemplative’s perceptions of  the <a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="green">p. 337</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_337"></a> Absolute. We find on analysis that these evoked  emotions separate themselves easily into two groups. Further, these  two groups answer to the two directions in which the mystic  consciousness of Reality is extended, and to the pairs of descriptions  of the Godhead which we have found to be characteristic of mystical  literature:   <i>i.e.</i>   , the personal and spatial, immanental and transcendental, indwelling  Life and Unconditioned Source; (  <i>a</i>   ) the strange, dark, unfathomable Abyss of Pure Being always dwelt  upon by mystics of the metaphysical type, and (  <i>b</i>   ) the divine and loved Companion of the soul, whose presence is so  sharply felt by those selves which lean to the concept of Divine  Personality.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p46"></a>  <i>A. The Contemplation of Transcendence.—</i>   The first group of feeling-states, allied to those which emphasize the  theological idea of Divine Transcendence, is born of the  mystic’s sense of his own littleness, unworthiness, and  incurable ignorance in comparison with the ineffable greatness of the  Absolute Godhead which he has perceived, and in which he desires to  lose himself; of the total and incommunicable difference   <i>in kind</i>    between the Divine and everything else. Awe and self-abasement, and  the paradoxical passion for self-loss in the All, here govern his  emotional state. All affirmative statements seem to him blasphemous,  so far are they from an ineffable truth which is “more than  reason, before reason, and after reason.” To this group of  feelings, which usually go with an instinctive taste for Neoplatonism,  an iconoclastic distrust of personal imagery, we owe all negative  descriptions of supreme Reality. For this type of self, God is the  Unconditioned, the Wholly Other for whom we have no words, and whom  all our poor symbols insult. To see Him is to enter the Darkness, the  “Cloud of Unknowing,” and “know only that we know  nought.” Nothing else can satisfy this extreme spiritual  humility; which easily degenerates into that subtle form of pride  which refuses to acquiesce in the limitations of its own creaturely  state.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p47"></a>“There is none other God but He that none may  know, which may not be known,” says this contemplative soul.  “No, soothly no! Without fail, No, says she. He only is my God  that none can one word of say, nor all they of Paradise one only point  attain nor understand, for all the knowing that they have of  Him.”   <a name="fr_696"></a><a href="#fn_696"><font size="1">697</font></a>

 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p49"></a>When they try to be geographically exact, to define  and describe their apprehension of, and contact with, the  Unconditioned One who is the only Country of the Soul, contemplatives  of this type become, like their great master the Areopagite, <a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="green">p. 338</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_338"></a> impersonal and remote. They seem to have been caught up to  some measureless height, where the air is too rarefied for the lungs  of common men. When we ask them the nature of the life on these  summits, they are compelled as a rule to adopt the Dionysian concept  of Divine Darkness, or the parallel idea of the fathomless Abyss, the  Desert of the Godhead, the Eckhartian “still wilderness where no  one is at home.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p50"></a>Oddly enough, it is in their language concerning this  place or plane of reality, in which union with the Super-essential  Godhead takes place—this “lightsome darkness and rich  nought”—that they come nearer to distinct affirmation, and  consequently offer more surprises to sentimental and anthropomorphic  piety, than in any other department of their work. Unquestionably this  language, with its constant reference to a “still desert,”  a “vast sea,” an “unplumbed abyss” in which  the “emptiness,” the “nothing,” the  “Dark” on which the self entered in the Orison of Quiet is  infinitely increased, yet positive satisfaction is at last attained,  does correspond with a definite psychological experience. It is not  merely the convention of a school. These descriptions, incoherent as  they are, have a strange note of certainty, a stranger note of  passion, an odd realism of their own: which mean, wherever we meet  them, that experience not tradition is their source. Driven of  necessity to a negation of all that their surface-minds have ever  known—with language, strained to the uttermost, failing them at  every turn—these contemplatives are still able to communicate to  us a definite somewhat; news as to a given and actual Reality, an  unchanging Absolute, and a beatific union with it, most veritably  attained. They agree in their accounts of it, in a way which makes it  obvious that all these reporters have sojourned in the same land, and  experienced the same spiritual state. Moreover, our inmost minds bear  witness for them. We meet them half-way. We know instinctively and  irrefutably that they tell true; and they rouse in us a passionate  nostalgia, a bitter sense of exile and of loss.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p51"></a>One and all, these explorers of the Infinite fly to  language expressive of great and boundless spaces. In their withdrawal  from the busy, fretful sense-world they have sunk down to the  “ground” of the soul and of the apparent universe: Being,  the Substance of all that Is. Multiplicity is resolved into Unity: a  unity with which the perceiving self is merged. Thus the mystic, for  the time of this “union with the Divine,” does find  himself, in Tauler’s words, to be “simply in  God.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p52"></a>“The great wastes to be found in this divine  ground,” says that great master, “have neither image nor  form nor condition, for they are neither here nor there. They are like  unto a fathomless <a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="green">p. 339</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_339"></a> Abyss, bottomless and floating in  itself. Even as water ebbs and flows, up and down; now sinking into a  hollow, so that it looks as if there were no water there, and then  again in a little while rushing forth as if it would engulf  everything, so does it come to pass in this Abyss. This, truly, is  much more God’s Dwelling-place than heaven or man. A man who  verily desires to enter will surely find God here, and himself simply  in God; for God never separates Himself from this ground. God will be  present with him, and he will find and enjoy Eternity here. There is  no past nor present here, and no created light can reach unto or shine  into this divine Ground; for here only is the dwelling-place of God  and His sanctuary.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p53"></a>“Now this Divine Abyss can be fathomed by no  creatures; it can be filled by none, and it satisfies none, God only  can fill it in His Infinity. For this abyss belongs only to the Divine  Abyss of which it is written: <a name="an_iv.vii-p53.1"></a>  <i>Abysses abyssum invocal</i>     .    He who is truly conscious of this ground, which shone into the powers  of his soul, and lighted and inclined its lowest and highest powers to  turn to their pure Source and true Origin, must diligently examine  himself, and remain alone, listening to the voice which cries in the  wilderness of this ground. This ground is so desert and bare that no  thought has ever entered there. None of all the thoughts of man which,  with the help of reason, have been devoted to meditation on the Holy  Trinity (and some men have occupied themselves much with these  thoughts) have ever entered this ground. For it is so close and yet so  far off, and so far beyond all things, that it has neither time nor  place. It is a simple and unchanging condition. A man who really and  truly enters, feels as though he had been here throughout eternity,  and as though he were one therewith.”   <a name="fr_697"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">698</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p55"></a>Many other mystics have written to the same effect:  have described with splendour the ineffable joys and terrors of the  Abyss of Being “where man existed in God from all  Eternity,” the soul’s adventures when, “stripped of  its very life,” it “sails the wild billows of the sea  divine.” But their words merely amaze the outsider and give him  little information. The contemplative self who has attained this  strange country can only tell an astonished and incredulous world that  here his greatest deprivation is also his greatest joy; that here the  extremes of possession and surrender are the same, that ignorance and  knowledge, light and dark, are   <i>One.</i>    Love has led him into that timeless, spaceless world of Being which  is the peaceful ground, not only of the individual striving spirit,  but also of the striving universe; and he can but cry with Philip,  “  <i>It is</i>      <i>enough.”</i>    <a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="green">p. 340</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_340"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p56"></a>“Here,” says Maeterlinck, “we stand  suddenly at the confines of human thought, and far beyond the Polar  circle of the mind. It is intensely cold here; it is intensely dark,  and yet you will find nothing but flames and light. But to those who  come without having trained their souls to these new perceptions, this  light and these flames are as dark and as cold as if they were  painted. Here we are concerned with the most exact of sciences: with  the exploration of the harshest and most uninhabitable headlands of  the divine ‘Know thyself’: and the midnight sun reigns  over that rolling sea where the psychology of man mingles with the  psychology of God.”   <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">699</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p58"></a>On one hand “flames and light”—the  flame of living and creative love which fills the universe—on  the other the “quiet desert of Godhead,” transcending all  succession and dark to the single sight of earth-born men. Under these  two metaphors, one affirmative, one negative, resumed in his most  daring paradox nearly the whole of man’s contemplative  experience of the Absolute can be and is expressed. We have considered  his negative description of Utmost Transcendence: that confession of  “divine ignorance” which is a higher form of knowledge.  But this is balanced, in a few elect spirits, by a positive  contemplation of truth; an ecstatic apprehension of the “secret  plan.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p59"></a>Certain rare mystics seem able to describe to us a  Beatific Vision experienced here and now: a knowledge by contact of  the flaming heart of Reality, which includes in one great whole the  planes of Being and Becoming, the Simultaneous and the Successive, the  Eternal Father, and His manifestation in the “energetic  Word.” We saw something of this power, which is characteristic  of mystical genius of a high order, in studying the characteristics of  Illumination. Its finest literary expression is found in that passage  of the “Paradiso” where Dante tells us how he pierced, for  an instant, the secret of the Empyrean. Already he had enjoyed a  symbolic vision of two-fold Reality as the moving River of Light and  the still white Rose.   <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">700</font></a>
     Now these two aspects vanished, and he saw the One.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.vii-p60.1"></a> “. . . la mia vista,  venendo sincera<br>   e più e più entrava per lo raggio<br>   dell’ alta luce, che da sè è  vera.<br>   Da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio<br>   che il parlar nostro ch’ a tal vista cede,<br>   e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio. <a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_341"></a><br>   Qual è colui che somniando vede,<br>   chè dopo il sogno la passione impressa<br>   rimane, e l’ altro alla mente non riede;<br>   cotal son io, che quasi tutta cessa<br>   mia visione, ed ancor mi distilla<br>   nel cor lo dolce che nacque da essa.<br>   . . . .<br>   Io credo, per l’ acume ch’ io  soffersi<br>   del vivo raggio, ch’ io sarei smarrito,<br>   se gli occhi miei da lui fossero aversi.<br>   E mi ricorda ch’ io fui più ardito<br>   per questo a sostener tanto ch’ io giunsi<br>   l’ aspetto mio col valor infinito.<br>   Così la mente mia, tutta sospesa,<br>   mirava fissa, immobile ed attenta,<br>   e sempre del mirar faceasi accesa.<br>   A quella luce cotal si diventa,<br>   che volgersi da lei per altro aspetto<br>   è impossibil che mai si consenta.<br>   Però che il Ben, ch’ è del volere  obbietto,<br>   tutto s’accoglie in lei, e fuor di quella<br>   è difettivo cio che lì è  perfetto.” <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">701</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p62"></a>Intermediate between the Dantesque apprehension of  Eternal Reality and the contemplative communion with Divine  Personality, is the type of mystic whose perceptions of the  suprasensible are neither wholly personal nor wholly cosmic and  transcendental in type. To him, God is pre-eminently the  Perfect—Goodness, Truth, and Beauty, Light, Life, and  Love—discovered in a moment of lucidity at the very door of the  seeking self. Here the symbols under which He is perceived are still  the abstractions of philosophy; but in the hands of the mystic these  terms cease to be abstract, are stung to life. Such contemplatives  preserve the imageless and ineffable character of the Absolute, but  are moved by its contemplation to a joyous and personal love.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p63"></a>Thus, in a striking passage of her revelations, Angela  of Foligno <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="green">p. 342</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_342"></a> suddenly exclaims, “I saw  God!” “And I, the writing brother,” says her  secretary, “asked her what she saw, how she saw, and if she saw  any bodily thing. She replied thus: ‘I beheld a fullness and a  clearness, and felt them within me so abundantly that I cannot  describe it, or give any likeness thereof. I cannot say I saw anything  corporeal. It was as though it were in heaven: a beauty so great that  I can say nought concerning it, save that it was supreme Beauty and  sovereign Good.’” Again, “I beheld the ineffable  fullness of God: but I can relate nothing of it, save that I have seen  in it the Sovereign Good.”   <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">702</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p65"></a>  <i>B. The Contemplation of Immanence.—</i>   The second group of contemplatives is governed by that “Love  which casteth out fear”: by a predominating sense of the  nearness, intimacy, and sweetness, rather than the strangeness and  unattainable transcendence, of that same Infinite Life at whose being  the first group could only hint by amazing images which seem to be  borrowed from the poetry of metaphysics. These are, says Hilton, in a  lovely image, “Feelingly fed with the savour of His invisible  blessed Face.”   <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">703</font></a>
     All the feelings which flow from joy, confidence, and affection,  rather than those which are grouped about rapture and awe—though  awe is always present in some measure, as it is always present in all  perfect love—here contribute towards a description of the  Truth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p67"></a>These contemplatives tell us of their attainment of  That which Is, as the closest and most joyous of all communions; a  coming of the Bridegroom; a rapturous immersion in the Uncreated  Light. “Nothing more profitable, nothing merrier than grace of  contemplation!” cries Rolle, “that lifts us from this low  and offers to God. What is grace of contemplation but beginning of  joy? what is parfiteness of joy but grace confirmed?   <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">704</font></a>
     In such “bright contemplation” as this, says “The  Mirror of Simple Souls,” “the soul is full gladsome and  jolly.” Utter peace and wild delight, every pleasure-state known  to man’s normal consciousness, are inadequate to the description  of her joy. She has participated for an instant in the Divine Life;  knows all, and knows nought. She has learnt the world’s secret,  not by knowing, but by being: the only way of really knowing  anything.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p69"></a>Where the dominant emotion is that of intimate  affection, and where the training or disposition of the mystic  inclines him to emphasize the personal and Incarnational rather than  the abstract and Trinitarian side of Christianity, the contemplative  of this type will always tend to describe his secret to us as above  <a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="green">p. 343</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_343"></a> all things an experience of adorable Friendship.  Reality is for him a Person, not a State. In the “orison of  union” it seems to him that an actual communion, a merging of  his self with this other and strictly personal Self takes place.  “God,” he says, then “meets the soul in her  Ground”:   <i>i.e.</i>   , in that secret depth of personality where she participates in the  Absolute Life. Clearly, the “degree of contemplation,” the  psychological state, is here the same as that in which the mystic of  the impersonal type attained the “Abyss.” But from the  point of view of the subject, this joyful and personal encounter of  Lover and Beloved will be a very different experience from the  soul’s immersion in that “desert of Deity,” as  described by Eckhart and his school. “In this oning,” says  Hilton, “is the marriage made betwixt God and the soul, that  shall never be broken.”   <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">705</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p71"></a>St. Teresa is the classic example of this intimate and  affective type of contemplation: but St. Gertrude, Suso, Julian,  Mechthild of Magdeburg, and countless others, provide instances of its  operation. We owe to it all the most beautiful and touching  expressions of mystic love. Julian’s “I saw Him and sought  Him: and I had Him, I wanted Him” expresses in epigram its  combination of rapturous attainment and insatiable desire: its  apprehension of a Presence at once friendly and divine. So too does  her description of the Tenth Revelation of Love, when “with this  sweet enjoying He showed unto mine understanding in part   <i>the blessed Godhead,</i>    stirring then the poor soul to understand, as it may be said; that  is, to think on the endless Love that was without beginning, and is,  and shall be ever. And with this our good Lord said full blissfully,   <i>Lo, how that I loved thee,</i>    as if He had said, My   <i>darling, behold and see thy Lord, thy God that is thy Matter, and  thine endless joy.”</i>    <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">706</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p73"></a>“The eyes of her soul were opened,” says  the scribe to whom Angela of Foligno dictated her revelations.  “And she saw Love advancing gently towards her; and she saw the  beginning, but not the end, for it was continuous. And there was no  colour to which she could compare this Love; but directly it reached  her she beheld it with the eyes of the soul, more clearly than she  might do with the eyes of the body, take as towards her the semblance  of a sickle. Not that there was any actual and measurable likeness,  but this love took on the semblance of a sickle, because it first  withdrew itself, not giving itself so fully as it had allowed itself  to be understood and she had understood it; the which caused her to  yearn for it the more.”   <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">707</font></a>
     <a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="green">p. 344</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_344"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p75"></a>It is to Mechthild of Magdeburg, whose contemplation  was emphatically of the intimate type, that we owe the most perfect  definition of this communion of the mystic with his Friend.  “Orison,” she says, “draws the great God down into  the small heart: it drives the hungry soul out to the full God. It  brings together the two lovers, God and the soul, into a joyful room  where they speak much of love.”   <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">708</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p77"></a>We have already seen that the doctrine of the Trinity  makes it possible for Christian mystics, and, still more, for  Christian mysticism as a whole, to reconcile this way of apprehending  Reality with the “negative” and impersonal perception of  the ineffable One; the Absolute which “hath no image.”  Though they seem in their extreme forms to be so sharply opposed as to  justify Eckhart’s celebrated distinction between the unknowable  totality of the Godhead and the knowable personality of God, the  “image” and the “circle” yet represent diverse  apprehensions of one whole. All the mystics feel—and the German  school in particular have expressed—Dante’s conviction  that these two aspects of reality, these two planes of being, however  widely they seem to differ, are   <i>One</i>   .   <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">709</font></a>
     Both are ways of describing man’s partial contacts with that  Absolute Truth, “present yet absent, near, yet far,” that  Triune Fact, <a name="an_iv.vii-p78.1"></a>  <i>di</i>      <i>tre colori e d’ una continenza</i>     <i>,</i>    which is God. Both are necessary if we are to form any idea of that  complete Reality, imperfect as any such idea must be: as, when two men  go together to some undiscovered country, one will bring home news of  its great spaces, its beauty of landscape, another of its geological  formation, or the flora and fauna that express its life, and both must  be taken into account before any just estimate of the real country can  be made.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p79"></a>Since it is of the essence of the Christian religion  to combine personal and metaphysical truth, a transcendent and an  incarnate God,   <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">710</font></a>
     it is not surprising that we should find in Christianity a  philosophic and theological basis for this paradox of the  contemplative experience. Most often, though not always, the Christian  mystic identifies the personal and intimate Lover of the soul, of  whose elusive presence he is so sharply aware, with the person of  Christ; the unknowable and transcendent Godhead with that <a name="an_iv.vii-p80.1"></a><i>eterna luce</i>,    the Undifferentiated One in Whom the Trinity of Persons is resumed.  Temperamentally, most practical contemplatives lean to either one or  other of these apprehensions of Reality: to a personal and immanental  meeting in the “ground of the soul,” or to the austere  joys of the “naughted soul” abased before an impersonal  Transcendence which no language but <a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="green">p. 345</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_345"></a> that of  negation can define. In some, however, both types of perception seem  to exist together: and they speak alternately of light and darkness,  of the rapturous encounter with Love and of supreme self-loss in the  naked Abyss, the desert of the Essence of God. Ruysbroeck is the  perfect example of this type of contemplative; and his works contain  numerous and valuable passages descriptive of that synthetic  experience which resumes the personal and transcendental aspects of  the mystic fact.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p81"></a>“When we have become seeing,” he  says—that is to say, when we have attained to spiritual  lucidity—“we are able to contemplate in joy the eternal  coming of the Bridegroom; and this is the second point on which I  would speak. What, then, is this eternal coming of our Bridegroom? It  is a perpetual new birth and a perpetual new illumination: for the  ground whence the Light shines and which is Itself the Light, is  life-giving and fruitful: and hence the manifestation of the Eternal  Light is renewed without interruption in the hiddenness of the spirit.  Behold! here all human works and active virtues must cease; for here  God works alone at the apex of the soul. Here there is nought else but  an eternal seeing and staring at that Light, by the Light and in the  Light. And the coming of the Bridegroom is so swift, that He comes  perpetually, and He dwells within us with His abysmal riches, and He  returns to us anew in His Person without interruption; with such new  radiance, that He seems never to have come to us before. For His  coming consists, outside all Time, in an   <i>Eternal Now,</i>    always welcomed with new longing and new joy. Behold! the delights  and the joys which this Bridegroom brings in His coming are fathomless  and limitless, for they are Himself: and this is why the eyes by which  the spirit contemplates the Bridegroom, are opened so widely that they  can never close again. . . . Now this active meeting, and this loving  embrace, are in their essence fruitive and unconditioned; for the  infinite Undifferentiation of the Godhead is so dark and so naked of  all image, that it conceals within itself all the divine qualities and  works, all the attributes of the Persons, in the all-enfolding  richness of the Essential Unity, and brings about a divine fruition in  the Abyss of the Ineffable. And here there is a death in fruition, and  a melting and dying into the nudity of Pure Being; where all the Names  of God, and all conditions, and all the living images which are  reflected in the mirror of divine truth, are absorbed into the  Ineffable Simplicity, the Absence of image and of knowledge. For in  this limitless Abyss of Simplicity, all things are embraced in the  bliss of fruition; but the Abyss itself remains uncomprehended, except  by the Essential Unity. The Persons and all that which lives <a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="green">p. 346</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_346"></a> in God, must give place to this. For there is nought else  here but an eternal rest in the fruitive embrace of an outpouring  love: and this is the wayless Being that all interior souls have  chosen above all other things. This is the dim silence where all  lovers lose themselves.”   <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">711</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p83"></a>Here Ruysbroeck, beginning with a symbol of the Divine  Personality as Bridegroom of the Soul, which would have been congenial  to the mind of St. Catherine of Siena, ends upon the summits of  Christian metaphysics; with a description of the loving immersion of  the self in that Unconditioned One who transcends the Persons of  theology and beggars human speech. We seem to see him desperately  clutching at words and similes which may, he hopes, give some hint of  the soul’s fruition of Reality: its immeasurable difference in  kind from the dreams and diagrams of anthropomorphic religion. His  strange statements in respect of this Divine Abyss are on a par with  those which I have already quoted from the works of other  contemplatives, who, refusing to be led away by the emotional aspect  of their experience, have striven to tell us—as they  thought—not merely what they felt but what they beheld.  Ruysbroeck’s mystical genius, however, the depth and wholeness  of his intuition of Reality, does not allow him to be satisfied with a  merely spatial or metaphysical description of the Godhead. The  “active meeting” and the “loving embrace” are,  he sees, an integral part of the true contemplative act. In “the  dim silence where lovers lose themselves,” a Person meets a  person: and   <i>this</i>    it is, not the philosophic Absolute, which “all interior souls  have chosen above all other thing.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p84"></a>We must now look more closely at the method by which  the contemplative attains to his unique communion with the Absolute  Life: the kind of activity which seems to him to characterize his  mergence with Reality. As we might expect, that activity, like its  result, is of two kinds; personal and affirmative, impersonal and  negative. It is obvious that where Divine Perfection is conceived as  the soul’s companion, the Bridegroom, the Beloved, the method of  approach will be very different from that which ends in the  self’s immersion in the paradoxical splendour of the Abyss, the  “still wilderness where no one is at home.” It is all the  difference between the preparations for a wedding and for an  expedition to the Arctic Seas. Hence we find, at one end of the scale,  that extreme form of personal and intimate communion—the going  forth of lover to beloved—which the mystics call “the  orison of union”: and at the other end, the “dark  contemplation,” by which alone selves of the transcendent and  <a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="green">p. 347</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_347"></a> impersonal type claim that they draw near to the  Unconditioned One.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p85"></a>Of the dim and ineffable contemplation of Unnameable  Transcendence, the imageless absorption in the Absolute, Dionysius the  Areopagite of course provides the classic example. It was he who gave  to it the name of Divine Darkness: and all later mystics of this type  borrow their language from him. His directions upon the subject are  singularly explicit: his descriptions, like those of St. Augustine,  glow with an exultant sense of a Reality attained, and which others  may attain if they will but follow where he leads.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p86"></a>“As for thee, dear Timothy,” he says,  “I counsel that in the earnest exercise of mystical  contemplation thou leave the senses and the operations of the  intellect and all things that the senses or the intellect can  perceive, and all things in this world of nothingness or that world of  being; and that, thine understanding being laid to rest, thou ascend  (so far as thou mayest) towards union with Him whom neither being nor  understanding can contain. For by the unceasing and absolute  renunciation of thyself and all things, thou shalt in pureness cast  all things aside, and be released from all, and so shalt be led  upwards to the Ray of that Divine Darkness which exceetedth all  existence.”   <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_711"><font size="1">712</font></a>
     Again, “The Divine Dark is nought else but that inaccessible  light wherein the Lord is said to dwell. Although it is invisible  because of its dazzling splendours and unsearchable because of the  abundance of its supernatural brightness, nevertheless, whosoever  deserves to see and know God rests therein; and, by the very fact that  he neither sees nor knows, is truly in that which surpasses all truth  and all knowledge.”   <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_712"><font size="1">713</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p95"></a>It has become a commonplace with writers on mysticism  to say, that all subsequent contemplatives took from Dionysius this  idea of “Divine Darkness,” and entrance therein as the  soul’s highest privilege: took it, so to speak, ready-made and  on faith, and incorporated it in their tradition. To argue thus is to  forget that mystics are above all things practical people. They do not  write for the purpose of handing on a philosophical scheme, but in  order to describe something which they have themselves <a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="green">p. 348</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_348"></a> experienced; something which they feel to be of  transcendent importance for humanity. If, therefore, they  persist—and they do persist—in using this simile of  “darkness” to describe their experience in contemplation,  it can only be because it fits the facts. No Hegelian needs to be told  that we shall need the addition of its opposite before we can hope to  approach the truth: and it is exactly the opposite of this “dim  ignorance” which is offered us by mystics of the  “joyous” or “intimate” type, who find their  supreme satisfaction in the positive experience of  “union,” the “mystical marriage of the  soul.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p96"></a>What, then, do those who use this image of the  “dark” really mean by it? They mean this: that God in His  absolute Reality is unknowable—is dark—to man’s  intellect: which is, as Bergson has reminded us, adapted to other  purposes than those of divine intuition. When, under the spur of  mystic love, the whole personality of man comes into contact with that  Reality, it enters a plane of experience to which none of the  categories of the intellect apply. Reason finds itself, in a most  actual sense, “in the dark”—immersed in the Cloud of  Unknowing. This dimness and lostness of the mind, then, is a necessary  part of the mystic’s ascent to the Absolute. That  Absolute—the <a name="an_iv.vii-p96.1"></a>  <i>Mysterium tremendum et fascinans</i>      <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_713"><font size="1">714</font></a>
    —willnot be “known of the heart” until we  acknowledge that It is “unknown of the intellect”; and  obey the Dionysian injunction to leave “the operations of the  understanding” on one side. The movement of the contemplative  must be a movement of the whole man: he is to “precipitate  himself, free and unfettered,” into the bosom of Reality. Only  when he has thus transcended sight and knowledge, can he be sure that  he has also transcended the world with which these faculties are  competent to deal; and is   <i>in</i>    that Wholly Other which surpasses all image and all idea.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.vii-p97.1"></a> “This is Love: to fly heavenward,<br>   To rend, every instant, a hundred veils,<br>   The first moment, to renounce life;<br>   The last step, to fare without feet.<br>   To regard this world as invisible,<br>   Not to see what appears to oneself.”   <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_714"><font size="1">715</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p99"></a>This acknowledgment of our intellectual ignorance,  this humble surrender, is the entrance into the “Cloud of  Unknowing”: the first step towards mystical knowledge of the  Absolute. “For Truth and Humility are full true sisters,”  says Hilton, <a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="green">p. 349</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_349"></a> “fastened together in love and  charity, and there is no distance of counsel betwixt them two.”   <a name="fr_715"></a><a href="#fn_715"><font size="1">716</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p101"></a>“Thou askest me and sayest,” says the  author of “The Cloud of Unknowing,” “How shall I  think on Himself and what is He? and to this I cannot answer thee but  thus: I wot not.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p102"></a>“For thou hast brought me with thy question,  into that same darkness and into that same cloud of unknowing that I  would thou wert in thyself. For of all other creatures and their  works, yea and of the works of God’s self may a man through  grace have fulhead of knowledge, and well he can think of them; but of  God Himself can no man think. And therefore I will leave all that  thing that I can think, and choose to my love that thing that I cannot  think. For why; He may well be loved, but not thought. By love may He  be gotten and holden, but by thought never. . . . Smite upon that  thick cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love; and go not  thence for thing that befalleth.”   <a name="fr_716"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">717</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p104"></a>So long, therefore, as the object of the  mystic’s contemplation is amenable to thought, is something  which he can “know,” he may be quite sure that it is not  the Absolute; but only a partial image or symbol of the Absolute. To  find that final Reality, he must enter into the “cloud of  unknowing”—must pass beyond the plane on which the  intellect can work.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p105"></a>“When I say darkness,” says the same great  mystic, “I mean thereby a lack of knowing. . . . And for this  reason it is not called a cloud of the air, but a cloud of unknowing,  that is between thee and thy God.”   <a name="fr_717"></a><a href="#fn_717"><font size="1">718</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p107"></a>The business of the contemplative, then, is to enter  this cloud: the “good dark,” as Hilton calls it. The  deliberate inhibition of discursive thought and rejection of images,  which takes place in the “orison of quiet,” is one of the  ways in which this entrance is effected: personal surrender, or  “self-naughting,” is another. He who, by dint of  detachment and introversion, enters the “nothingness” or  “ground of the soul,” enters also into the  “Dark”: a statement which seems simple enough until we try  to realize what it means.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p108"></a>“O where,” says the bewildered disciple in  one of Boehme’s dialogues, “is this naked Ground of the  Soul void of all Self? And how shall I come at the hidden centre,  where God dwelleth and not man? Tell me plainly, loving Sir, where it  is, and how it is to be found of me, and entered into?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p109"></a>  <i>“Master.</i>    There where the soul hath slain its own Will and willeth no more any  Thing as from itself. . . . <a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="green">p. 350</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_350"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p110"></a>  <i>“Disciple.</i>    But how shall I comprehend it?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p111"></a>  <i>“Master.</i>    If thou goest about to comprehend it, then it will fly away from  thee, but if thou dost surrender thyself wholly up to it, then it will  abide with thee, and become the Life of thy Life, and be natural to  thee.”   <a name="fr_718"></a><a href="#fn_718"><font size="1">719</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p113"></a>The author of “The Cloud of Unknowing” is  particularly explicit as to the sense of dimness and confusion which  overwhelms the self when it first enters this Dark; a proceeding which  is analogous to that annihilation of thought in the interests of  passive receptivity which we have studied in the  “Quiet.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p114"></a>“At the first time when thou dost it,” he  says of the neophyte’s first vague steps in contemplation,  “thou findest but a darkness, and as it were a cloud of  unknowing thou knowest not what, saving that thou feelest in thy will  a naked intent unto God. This darkness and this cloud is, howsoever  thou dost, betwixt thee and thy God, and letteth thee, that thou  mayest neither see Him clearly by light of understanding in thy  reason, nor feel Him in sweetness of love in thine affection. And  therefore shape thee to bide in this darkness as long as thou mayest,  evermore crying after Him that thou lovest. For if ever thou shalt  feel Him or see Him as it may be here, it behoveth always to be in  this cloud and this darkness.”   <a name="fr_719"></a><a href="#fn_719"><font size="1">720</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p116"></a>From the same century, but from a very different  country and temperament, comes another testimony as to the supreme  value of this dark contemplation of the Divine: this absorption,  beyond the span of thought or emotion, in the “substance of all  that Is.” It is one of the most vivid and detailed accounts of  this strange form of consciousness which we possess; and deserves to  be compared carefully with the statements of “The Cloud of  Unknowing,” and of St. John of the Cross. We owe it to that  remarkable personality, the Blessed Angela of Foligno, who was  converted from a life of worldliness to become not only a Franciscan,  but also a Platonic mystic. In it we seem to hear the voice of  Plotinus speaking from the Vale of Spoleto.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p117"></a>“Whilst I was questioning her,” says her  secretary, “Christ’s faithful one was suddenly rapt in  spirit and seemed not to understand my words. And then was given her a  wondrous grace. After a short time . . . she began to tell me what  follows. ‘My soul has just been rapt to a state in which I  tasted unspeakable joy. I knew all I longed to know, possessed all I  longed to possess. I saw all Good.’ She said further: ‘In  this state the soul cannot believe that this Good will ever depart  from her, or that she will depart from it, or that she will again be  separated from it. But <a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="green">p. 351</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_351"></a> she delights herself in that  Sovereign Good. My soul sees nothing whatever that can be told of the  lips or the heart, she sees nothing, and she sees All . . . No good  that can be described or conceived is now the object of my hope; for I  have put all my hope in a secret Good, most hid and secret, which I  apprehend in great darkness.’ And as I, the brother, could not  receive or understand this dark, Christ’s faithful one wishing  to explain said: ‘If I see it in the dark, it is because it  surpasses all good. All, all the rest is but darkness. All which the  soul or heart can reach is inferior to this Good. That which I have  told hitherto, namely, all the soul grasps when she sees all creatures  filled with God, when she sees the divine power, and when she sees the  divine will, is inferior to this most secret Good; because this Good  which I see in the darkness is the All, and all other things are but  parts.’ And she added, ‘Though inexpressible, these other  things bring delight; but this vision of God in darkness brings no  smile to the lips, no devotion or fervour of love to the soul. . . .  All the countless and unspeakable favours God has done to me, all the  words He has said to me, all you have written are, I know, so far  below the Good I see in that great darkness that I do not put in them  my hope’ . . . Christ’s faithful one told me that her mind  had been uplifted but three times to this most high and ineffable mode  of beholding God in great darkness, and in a vision so marvellous and  complete. Certainly she had seen the Sovereign Good countless times  and always darkly; yet never in such a high manner and through such  great dark.”   <a name="fr_720"></a><a href="#fn_720"><font size="1">721</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p119"></a>These words, and indeed the whole idea which lies at  the bottom of “dark contemplation,” will perhaps be better  understood in the light of Baron von Hügel’s deeply  significant saying “Souls loving God in His Infinite  Individuality will necessarily love Him beyond their intellectual  comprehension of Him; the element of devoted trust, of free  self-donation to One fully known   <i>only through and in such an act,</i>    will thus remain to man for ever.”   <a name="fr_721"></a><a href="#fn_721"><font size="1">722</font></a>
     Hence, the contemplative act, which is an act of loving and  self-forgetting concentration upon the Divine—the outpouring of  man’s little and finite personality towards the Absolute  Personality of God—will, in so far as it transcends thought,  mean darkness for the intellect; but it may mean radiance for the  heart. Psychologically, it will mean the necessary depletion of the  surface-consciousness, the stilling of the mechanism of thought, in  the interests of another centre of consciousness. Since this new  centre makes enormous demands on the self’s stock of vitality  its establishment must involve, for the time that it is active, the  withdrawal <a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="green">p. 352</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_352"></a> of energy from other centres. Thus the  “night of thought” becomes the strictly logical corollary  of the “light of perception.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p121"></a>No one has expressed this double character of the  Divine Dark—its “nothingness” for the dissecting  knife of reason, its supreme fruitfulness for expansive, active  love—with so delicate an insight as St. John of the Cross. In  his work the Christian touch of personal rapture vivifies the exact  and sometimes arid descriptions of the Neoplatonic mystics. A great  poet as well as a great mystic, in his poem on the “Obscure  Night,” he brings to bear on the actual and ineffable experience  of the introverted soul all the highest powers of artistic expression,  all the resources of musical rhythm, the suggestive qualities of  metaphor.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.vii-p121.1"></a> “Upon an obscure night<br>   Fevered with Love’s anxiety<br>   (O hapless, happy plight!)<br>   I went, none seeing me,<br>   Forth from my house, where all things quiet be.<br>   By night, secure from sight<br>   And by a secret stair, disguisedly,<br>   (O hapless, happy plight!)<br>   By night, and privily<br>   Forth from my house, where all things quiet be.<br>   Blest night of wandering<br>   In secret, when by none might I be spied,<br>   Nor I see anything:<br>   Without a light to guide<br>   Save that which in my heart burnt in my side.<br>   That light did lead me on,<br>   More surely than the shining of noontide<br>   Where well I knew that One<br>   Did for my coming bide;<br>   Where He abode might none but He abide.<br>   O night that didst lead thus<br>   O night more lovely than the dawn of light;<br>   O night that broughtest us,<br>   Lover to lover’s sight,<br>   Lover to loved, in marriage of delight!<br>   Upon my flowery breast<br>   Wholly for Him and save Himself for none,<br>   There did I give sweet rest<br>   To my beloved one:<br>   The fanning of the cedars breathed thereon.”   <a name="fr_722"></a><a href="#fn_722"><font size="1">723</font></a>
     <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="green">p. 353</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_353"></a><br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p123"></a>Observe in these verses the perfect fusion of personal  and metaphysical imagery; each contributing by its suggestive  qualities to a total effect which conveys to us, we hardly know how,  the obscure yet flaming rapture of the mystic, the affirmation of his  burning love and the accompanying negation of his mental darkness and  quiet—that “hapless, happy plight.” All is here: the  secrecy of the contemplative’s true life, unseen of other men  his deliberate and active abandonment of the comfortable house of the  senses, the dim, unknown plane of being into which his ardent spirit  must plunge—a “night more lovely than the dawn of  light”—the Inward Light, the fire of mystic love, which  guides his footsteps “more surely than the shining of  noon-tide”: the self-giving ecstasy of the consummation  “wholly for Him, and save Himself for none,” in which  lover attains communion with Beloved “in marriage of  delight.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p124"></a>In his book, “The Dark Night of the Soul,”  St. John has commented upon the opening lines of this poem; and the  passages in which he does this are amongst the finest and most subtle  descriptions of the psychology of contemplation which we possess.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p125"></a>“The soul,” he says, “calls the dim  contemplation, by which it ascends to the union of love, a secret  stair; and that because of two properties of this contemplation which  I shall explain separately. First, this dark contemplation is called  secret, because it is, as I have said before, the mystical theology  which theologians call secret wisdom, and which according to St.  Thomas is infused into the soul more especially by love. This happens  in a secret hidden way, in which the natural operations of the  understanding and the other powers have no share. . . . The soul can  neither discern nor give it a name, neither desires so to do; and  besides, it can discover no way nor apt comparison by which to make  known a knowledge so high, a   <i>spiritual impression so delicate and infused.</i>    Sothat even if the soul felt the most lively desire to explain  itself, and heaped up explanations, the secret would remain a secret  still. Because this interior wisdom is so simply, general, and  spiritual, that it enters not into the understanding under the guise  of any form or image perceptible to sense. Therefore the senses and  the imagination—which have not served as intermediaries, and  have perceived no sensible form or colour—cannot account for it,  nor form any conception of it, so as to speak about it; though the  soul be distinctly aware that it feels and tastes this strange wisdom.  The soul is like a man who sees an object for the first time, the like  of which he has never seen before; he perceives it and likes it, yet  he cannot say what it is, nor give it a name, do what he will, though  it be even an object cognisable by the senses. How much less, then can  that <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="green">p. 354</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_354"></a> be described which does not enter in by the  senses. . . . Inexpressible in its natures as we have said, it is  rightly called secret. And for yet another reason it is so called; for  this mystical wisdom has the property of hiding the soul within  itself. For beside its ordinary operation, it sometimes happens that  this wisdom absorbs the soul and plunges it in a secret abyss wherein  it sees itself distinctly as far away, and separated from, all created  things; it looks upon itself as one that is placed in a profound and  vast solitude whither no creature can come, and which seems an immense  Wilderness without limits. And this solitude is the more delicious,  sweet, and lovely, the more it is deep, vast, and empty. There the  soul is the more hidden, the more it is raised up above all created  things.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p126"></a>“This abyss of wisdom now lifts up and enlarges  the soul, giving it to drink at the very sources of the science of  love. Thereby it perceives how lowly is the condition of all creatures  in respect to the supreme knowledge and sense of the Divine. It also  understands how low, defective, and, in a certain sense, improper, are  all the words and phrases by which in this life we discuss divine  things; that they escape the best efforts of human art and science,  and that only the mystical theology can know and taste what these  things are in their reality.”   <a name="fr_723"></a><a href="#fn_723"><font size="1">724</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p128"></a>In this important passage we have a reconciliation of  the four chief images under which contemplation has been described:  the darkness and the light, the wilderness and the union of love. That  is to say, the self’s paradoxical sense of an ignorance which is  supreme knowledge, and of a solitude which is intimate companionship.  On the last of these antitheses, the “wilderness that is more  delicious, sweet, and lovely, the more it is wide, vast, and  empty,” I cannot resist quoting, as a gloss upon the dignified  language of the Spanish mystic, the quaint and simple words of Richard  Rolle.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p129"></a>“In the wilderness . . . speaks the loved to the  heart of the lover, as it were a bashful lover, that his sweetheart  before men entreats not, nor friendly-wise but commonly and as a  stranger he kisses. A devout soul safely from worldly business in mind  and body departed . . . anon comes heavenly joy, and it marvellously  making merry melody, to her springs; whose token she takes, that now  forward worldly sound gladly she suffers not. <a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="green">p. 355</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_355"></a> This  is ghostly music, that is unknown to all that with worldly business  lawful or unlawful are occupied. No man there is that this has known,  but he that has studied to God only to take heed.”   <a name="fr_724"></a><a href="#fn_724"><font size="1">725</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p131"></a>Doubtless the “dark transcendence”  reported and dwelt upon by all mystics of the Dionysian type, is  nearest the truth of all our apprehensions of God:   <a name="fr_725"></a><a href="#fn_725"><font size="1">726</font></a>
     though it can be true only in the paradoxical sense that it uses the  suggestive qualities of negation—the Dark whose very existence  involves that of Light—to hint at the infinite Affirmation of  All that Is. But the nearer this language is to the Absolute, the  further it is from ourselves. Unless care be taken in the use of it,  the elimination of falsehood may easily involve for us the elimination  of everything else. Man is not yet pure spirit, has not attained the  Eternal. He is in via and will never arrive if impatient amateurs of  Reality insist on cutting the ground from under his feet. Like Dante,  he needs a ladder to the stars, a ladder which goes the whole way from  the human to the divine. Therefore the philosophic exactitude of these  descriptions of the dark must be balanced, as they are in St. John of  the Cross, by the personal, human, and symbolic affirmations of Love,  if we would avoid a distorted notion of the Reality which the  contemplative attains in his supreme “flights towards  God.” Consciousness has got to be helped across the gap which  separates it from its Home.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p133"></a>The “wilderness,” the dread Abyss, must be  made homely by the voice of “the lover that His sweetheart  before men entreats not.” Approximate as we know such an image  of our communion with the Absolute to be, it represents a real aspect  of the contemplative experience which eludes the rule and compass of  metaphysical thought. Blake, with true mystic insight, summed up the  situation as between the two extreme forms of contemplation when he  wrote:—   <a name="fr_726"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">727</font></a>
  </p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.vii-p134.1"></a> “God appears, and God is Light<br>   To those poor souls who dwell in night:<br>   But doth a human form display<br>   To those who dwell in realms of day.”<br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p135"></a>In the “orison of union” and the  “Spiritual Marriage,” those contemplatives whose  temperament inclines them to “dwell in realms of day”  receive just such a revelation of the “human form”—a  revelation which the Christian dogma of the Incarnation brings to a  point. They apprehend the personal and passionate aspect of the  Infinite Life; and the love, at once intimate and expansive,  all-demanding and all-renouncing, which plays like <a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="green">p. 356</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_356"></a>  lightning between it and the desirous soul. “Thou saidst to me,  my only Love, that Thou didst will to make me Thyself; and that Thou  wast all mine, with all that Thou hadst and with all Paradise, and  that I was all Thine. That I should leave all, or rather the nothing;  and that (then) thou wouldst give me the all. And that Thou hadst  given me this name—at which words I heard within me <a name="an_iv.vii-p135.1"></a>‘dedi te in lucem  gentium’—not without good reason. And it  seemed then, as though I had an inclination for nothing except the  purest Union, without any means, in accordance with that detailed  sight which Thou hadst given me. So then I said to Thee: These other  things, give them to whom Thou wilt; give me but this most pure Union  with Thee, free from every means.”   <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">728</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p137"></a>“Our work is the love of God,” cries  Ruysbroeck. “Our satisfaction lies in submission to the Divine  Embrace.” This utter and abrupt submission to the Divine Embrace  is the essence of that form of contemplation which is called the  Orison of Union. “Surrender” is its secret: a personal  surrender, not only of finite to Infinite, but of bride to Bridegroom,  heart to Heart. This surrender, in contemplatives of an appropriate  temperament, is of so complete and ecstatic a type that it involves a  more or less complete suspension of normal consciousness, an  entrancement; and often crosses the boundary which separates  contemplation from true ecstasy, producing in its subject physical as  well as psychical effects. In this state, says St. Teresa,  “There is no sense of anything: only fruition, without  understanding what that may be the fruition of which is granted. It is  understood that the fruition is of a certain good, containing in  itself all good together at once; but this good is not comprehended.  The senses are all occupied in this fruition in such a way, that not  one of them is at liberty so as to be able to attend to anything else,  whether outward or inward. . . . But this state of complete  absorption, together with the utter rest of the imagination—for  I believe that the imagination is then wholly at rest—lasts only  for a short time; though the faculties do not so completely recover  themselves as not to be for some hours afterwards as if in disorder. .  . . He who has had experience of this will understand it in some  measure, for it cannot be more clearly described, because what then  takes place is so obscure. All I am able to say is, that the soul is  represented as being close to God; and that there abides a conviction  thereof so certain and strong that it cannot possibly help believing  so. All the faculties fail now, and are suspended in such a way that,  as I said before, their operations cannot be <a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vii-Page_357"></a>  traced. . . . The will must be fully occupied in loving, but it  understands not how it loves; the understanding, if it understands,  does not understand how it understands. It does not understand, as it  seems to me, because, as I said just now, this is a matter which  cannot be understood.”   <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">729</font></a>
     Clearly, the psychological situation here is the same as that in  which mystics of the impersonal type feel themselves to be involved in  the Cloud of Unknowing, or Divine Dark.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p139"></a>“Do not imagine,” says St. Teresa in  another place, “that this orison, like that which went before [  <i>i.e.</i>   , the quiet] is a sort of drowsiness: (I call it drowsiness, because  the soul seems to slumber being neither thoroughly asleep, nor  thoroughly awake). In the prayer of union the soul is asleep; fast  asleep as regards herself and earthly things. In fact, during the  short time that this state lasts she is deprived of all feeling, and  though she wishes it, she can think of nothing. Thus she needs no  effort in order to suspend her thoughts; if the soul can  love—she knows not how or when she loves, nor what she desires .  . . she is, as it were, entirely dead to the world, the better to live  in God.”   <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">730</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vii-p141"></a>It may be asked, in what way does such contemplation  as this differ from unconsciousness. The difference, according to St.  Teresa, consists in the definite   <i>somewhat</i>    which takes place during this inhibition of the  surface-consciousness: a “somewhat” of which that  surface-consciousness becomes aware when it awakes. True  contemplation, as the mystics are constantly assuring us, must always  be judged by its fruits. If it be genuine, work has been done during  the period of apparent passivity. The deeper self has escaped, has  risen to freedom, and returns other than it was before. We must  remember that Teresa is speaking from experience, and that her  temperamental peculiarities will modify the form which this experience  takes. “The soul,” she says, “neither sees, hears,  nor understands anything while this state lasts; but this is usually a  very short time, and seems to the soul even shorter than it really is.  God visits the soul in a way that prevents it doubting when it comes  to itself   <i>that is has been in God and God in it;</i>    and so firmly is it convinced of this truth that, though years may  pass before this state recurs, the soul can never forget it nor doubt  its reality. . . . But you will say, how can the soul see and  comprehend that she is in God and God in her, if during this union she  is not able either to see or understand? I reply, that she does not  see it at the time, but that afterwards she perceives it clearly: not  by a vision, but by a certitude which remains in the heart which God  alone can give.”   <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">731</font></a>

 </p><p><a name="an_iv.vii-p61"></a>          Par. xxxiii. 52-63, 76-81, 97-105. “My vision, becoming    purified, entered deeper and deeper into the ray of that Supernal    Light which in itself is true. Thenceforth my vision was greater    than our language, which fails such a sight; and memory too fails    before such excess. As he who sees in a dream, and after the dream    is gone the impression or emotion remains, but the rest returns not    to the mind, such am I for nearly the whole of my vision fades, and    yet there still wells within my heart the sweetness born therefrom.    . . . I think that by the keenness of the living ray which I endured    I had been lost, had I once turned my eyes aside. And I remember    that for this I was the bolder so long to sustain my gaze, as to    unite it with the Power Infinite. . . . Thus did my mind, wholly in    suspense, gaze fixedly, immovable and intent, ever enkindled by its    gazing. In the presence of that Light one becomes such, that never    could one consent to turn from it to any other sight. Because the    Good, which is the object of the will, is therein wholly gathered;    and outside of this, that is defective which therein is    perfect.”</p>

It is perhaps advisable to warn the reader that in this    work St. John applies the image of “darkness” to three    absolutely different things:     <i>i.e</i>     ., to a purgation of mind which he calls the “night of    sense”, to dim contemplation, or the Dionysian “Divine    Dark”, and to the true “dark night of the soul,”    which he calls the “night of the spirit.” The result has    been a good deal of confusion, in modern writers on mysticism upon    the subject of the “Dark Night.”</p>
