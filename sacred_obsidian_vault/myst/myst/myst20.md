 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p1"></a>We<a name="an_iv.ix-p1.1"></a> have wandered during the last few chapters from our study of the  mystical life-process in man, the organic growth of his transcendental  consciousness, in order to examine the byproducts of that process, its  characteristic forms of self-expression: the development of its normal  art of contemplation, and the visions and voices, ecstasies and  raptures which are frequent—though not  essential—accompaniments of its activity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p2"></a>But the mystic, like other persons of genius, is man  first and artist afterwards. We shall make a grave though common  mistake if we forget this and allow ourselves to be deflected from our  study of his growth in personality by the wonder and interest of his  art. Being, not Doing, is the first aim of the mystic; and hence  should be the first interest of the student of mysticism. We have  considered for convenience’ sake all the chief forms of mystical  activity at the half-way house of the transcendental life: but these  activities are not, of course, peculiar to any one stage of that life.  Ecstasy, for instance, is as common a feature of mystical conversion  <a name="page_381"><font size="1" color="green">p. 381</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_381"></a> as of the last crisis, or “mystic  marriage” of the soul:   <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">783</font></a>
     whilst visions and voices—in selves of a visionary or auditive  type—accompany and illustrate every phase of the inward  development. They lighten and explain the trials of Purgation as often  as they express the joys of Illumination, and frequently mark the  crisis of transition from one mystic state to the next.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p4"></a>One exception, however, must be made to this rule. The  most intense period of that great swing-back into darkness which  usually divides the “first mystic life,” or Illuminative  Way, from the “second mystic life,” or Unitive Way, is  generally a period of utter blankness and stagnation, so far as  mystical activity is concerned. The “Dark Night of the  Soul,” once fully established, is seldom lit by visions or made  homely by voices. It is of the essence of its miseries that the  once-possessed power of orison or contemplation now seems wholly lost.  The self is tossed back from its hard-won point of vantage. Impotence,  blankness, solitude, are the epithets by which those immersed in this  dark fire of purification describe their pains. It is this episode in  the life-history of the mystic type to which we have now come.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p5"></a>We have already noticed   <a name="fr_783"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">784</font></a>
     the chief psychological characteristics of all normal mystical  development. We have seen that its essence consists in the effort to  establish a new equilibrium, to get, as it were, a firm foothold upon  transcendent levels of reality; and that in its path towards this  consummation the self experiences a series of oscillations between  “states of pleasure” and “states of pain.” Put  in another way, it is an orderly movement of the whole consciousness  towards higher centres, in which each intense and progressive  affirmation fatigues the immature transcendental powers, and is paid  for by a negation; a swing-back of the whole consciousness, a  stagnation of intellect, a reaction of the emotions, or an inhibition  of the will.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p7"></a>Thus the exalted consciousness of Divine Perfection  which the self acquired in its “mystical awakening” was  balanced by a depressed and bitter consciousness of its own inherent  imperfection, and the clash of these two perceptions spurred it to  that laborious effort of accommodation which constitutes the  “Purgative Way.” The renewed and ecstatic awareness of the  Absolute which resulted, and which was the governing characteristic of  Illumination, brought its own proper negation: the awareness, that is  to say, of the self’s continued separation from and  incompatibility with that Absolute which it has perceived. During the  time in which the illuminated consciousness is fully established, the  self, as a rule, is perfectly content: believing that in its vision  <a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="green">p. 382</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_382"></a> of Eternity, its intense and loving consciousness  of God, it has reached the goal of its quest. Sooner or later,  however, psychic fatigue sets in; the state of illumination begins to  break up, the complementary negative consciousness appears, and shows  itself as an overwhelming sense of darkness and deprivation. This  sense is so deep and strong that it inhibits all consciousness of the  Transcendent; and plunges the self into the state of negation and  misery which is called the Dark Night.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p8"></a>We may look at the Dark Night, as at most other  incidents of the Mystic Way, from two points of view: (1) We may see  it, with the psychologist, as a moment in the history of mental  development, governed by the more or less mechanical laws which so  conveniently explain to him the psychic life of man: or (2) with the  mystic himself, we may see it in its spiritual aspect as contributing  to the remaking of character, the growth of the “New Man”;  his “transmutation in God.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p9"></a>(1) Psychologically considered, the Dark Night is an  example of the operation of the law of reaction from stress. It is a  period of fatigue and lassitude following a period of sustained  mystical activity. “It is one of the best established laws of  the nervous system,” says Starbuck, “that it has periods  of exhaustion if exercised continuously in one direction, and can only  recuperate by having a period of rest.”   <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">785</font></a>
     However spiritual he may be, the mystic—so long as he is in the  body—cannot help using the machinery of his nervous and cerebral  system in the course of his adventures. His development, on its  psychic side, consists in the taking over of this machinery, the  capture of its centres of consciousness, in the interests of his  growing transcendental life. In so far, then, as this is so, that  transcendental life will be partly conditioned by psychic necessities,  and amenable to the laws of reaction and of fatigue. Each great step  forward will entail lassitude and exhaustion for that mental machinery  which he has pressed unto service and probably overworked. When the  higher centres have been submitted to the continuous strain of a  developed illuminated life, with its accompanying periods of intense  fervour, lucidity, deep contemplation—perhaps of visionary and  auditive phenomena—the swing-back into the negative state occurs  almost of necessity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p11"></a>This is the psychological explanation of those strange  and painful episodes in the lives of great saints—indeed, of  many spiritual persons hardly to be classed as saints—when,  perhaps after a long life passed in faithful correspondence with the  transcendental order, growing consciousness of the “presence of  God,” the whole inner experience is suddenly swept away, and  only a <a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="green">p. 383</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_383"></a> blind reliance on past convictions saves  them from unbelief.   <a name="fr_785"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">786</font></a>
     The great contemplatives, those destined to attain the full stature  of the mystic, emerge from this period of destitution, however long  and drastic it may be, as from a new purification. It is for them the  gateway to a higher state. But persons of a less heroic spirituality,  if they enter the Night at all may succumb to its dangers and pains.  This “great negation” is the sorting-house of the  spiritual life. Here we part from the “nature mystics,”  the mystic poets, and all who shared in and were contented with the  illuminated vision of reality. Those who go on are the great and  strong spirits, who do not seek to   <i>know,</i>    but are driven to   <i>be.</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p13"></a>We are to expect, then, as a part of the conditions  under which human consciousness appears to work that for every  affirmation of the mystic life there will be a negation waiting for  the unstable self. Progress in contemplation, for instance, is marked  by just such an alternation of light and shade: at first between  “consolation” and “aridity”; then between  “dark contemplation” and sharp intuitions of Reality. So  too in selves of extreme nervous instability, each joyous ecstasy  entails a painful or negative ecstasy. The states of darkness and  illumination coexist over a long period, alternating sharply and  rapidly. Many seers and artists pay in this way, by agonizing periods  of impotence and depression, for each violent outburst of creative  energy.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p14"></a>Rapid oscillations between a joyous and a painful  consciousness seem to occur most often at the beginning of a new  period of the Mystic Way: between Purgation and Illumination, and  again between Illumination and the Dark Night: for these mental states  are, as a rule, gradually not abruptly established. Mystics call such  oscillations the “Game of Love” in which God plays, as it  were, “hide and seek” with the questing soul. I have  already quoted a characteristic instance from the life of Rulman  Merswin,   <a name="fr_786"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">787</font></a>
     who passed the whole intervening period between his conversion and  entrance on the Dark Night, or “school of suffering love”  in such a state of disequilibrium. Thus too Madame Guyon, who has  described with much elaboration of detail her symptoms and sufferings  during the oncoming and duration of the Night—or, as she calls  its intensest period the Mystic Death—traces its beginning in  short recurrent states of privation, or dullness of feeling, such as  ascetic writers call “aridity”: in which the self loses  all interest in and affection for those divine realities which had  <a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="green">p. 384</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_384"></a> previously filled its life. This privation followed  upon, or was the reaction from, an “illuminated” period of  extreme joy and security, in which, as she says, “the presence  of God never left me for an instant. But how dear I paid for this time  of happiness! For this possession, which seemed to me entire and  perfect—and the more perfect the more it was secret, and foreign  to the senses, steadfast and exempt from change—was but the  preparation for a total deprivation, lasting many years, without any  support or hope of its return.”   <a name="fr_787"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">788</font></a>
     As Madame Guyon never attempted to control her states, but made a  point of conforming to her own description of the “resigned  soul” as “God’s weathercock,” we have in her  an unequalled opportunity of study.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p17"></a>“I endured,” she says, “long periods  of privation, towards the end almost continual: but still I had from  time to time inflowings of Thy Divinity so deep and intimate, so vivid  and so penetrating, that it was easy for me to judge that Thou wast  but hidden from me and not lost. For although during the times of  privation it seemed to me that I had utterly lost Thee, a certain deep  support remained, though the soul knew it not: and she only became  aware of that support by her subsequent total deprivation thereof.  Every time that Thou didst return with more goodness and strength,  Thou didst return also with greater splendour; so that in a few hours  Thou didst rebuild all the ruins of my unfaithfulness and didst make  good to me with profusion all my loss.”   <a name="fr_788"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">789</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p19"></a>Here we have, from the psychological point of view, a  perfect example of the oscillations of consciousness on the threshold  of a new state. The old equilibrium, the old grouping round a centre  characterized by pleasure-affirmation, has been lost; the new grouping  round a centre characterized by pain-negation is not yet established.  Madame Guyon is standing, or rather swinging, between two worlds, the  helpless prey of her own shifting and uncontrollable psychic and  spiritual states. But slowly the pendulum approaches its limit: the  states of privation, “become almost continual,” the  reactions to illumination, become less. At last they cease entirely,  the new state is established, and the Dark Night has really set  in.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p20"></a>The theory here advanced that the “Dark  Night” is, on its psychic side, partly a condition of fatigue,  partly a state of transition, is borne out by the mental and moral  disorder which seems, in many subjects, to be its dominant character.  When they are in it everything seems to “go wrong” with  them. They are tormented by evil thoughts and abrupt temptations, lose  grasp not only of their spiritual but also of their worldly affairs.  Thus Lucie-Christine says: “Often during my great temptations to  <a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="green">p. 385</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_385"></a> sadness I am plunged in such spiritual darkness  that I think myself utterly lost in falsehood and illusion; deceiving  both myself and others. This temptation is the most terrible of  all.”   <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">790</font></a>
     The health of those passing through this phase often suffers, they  become “odd” and their friends forsake them; their  intellectual life is at a low ebb. In their own words “trials of  every kind,” “exterior and interior crosses,”  abound.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p22"></a>Now “trials,” taken<a name="an_iv.ix-p22.1"></a>  <i>en bloc</i>     <i>,</i>    mean a disharmony between the self and the world with which it has to  deal. Nothing is a trial when we are able to cope with it efficiently.  Things try us when we are not adequate to them: when they are  abnormally hard or we abnormally weak. This aspect of the matter  becomes prominent when we look further into the history of Madame  Guyon’s experiences. Thanks to the unctuous and detailed manner  in which she has analysed her spiritual griefs, this part of her  autobiography is a psychological document of unique importance for the  study of the “Dark Night” as it appears in a devout but  somewhat self-occupied soul.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p23"></a>As her consciousness of God was gradually  extinguished, a mental and moral chaos seems to have invaded Madame  Guyon and accompanied the more spiritual miseries of her state.  “So soon as I perceived the happiness of any state, or its  beauty, or the necessity of a virtue, it seemed to me that I fell  incessantly into the contrary vice: as if this perception, which  though very rapid was always accompanied by love, were only given to  me that I might experience its opposite. I was given an intense  perception of the purity of God; and so far as my feelings went, I  myself became more and more impure: for in reality this state is very  purifying, but I was far from understanding this. . . . My imagination  was in a state of appalling confusion, and gave me no rest. I could  not speak of Thee, oh my God, for I became utterly stupid; nor could I  even grasp what was said when I heard Thee spoken of. . . . I found  myself hard towards God, insensible to His mercies; I could not  perceive any good thing that I had done in my whole life. The good  appeared to me evil; and—that which is terrible—it seemed  to me that this state must last for ever.”   <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_790"><font size="1">791</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p25"></a>This world as well as the next seemed leagued against  her. Loss of health and friendship, domestic vexations, increased and  kept pace with her interior griefs. Self-control and power of  attention were diminished. She seemed stupefied and impotent, unable  to follow or understand even the services of the Church, incapable of  all prayer and all good works; perpetually attracted by those worldly  things which she had renounced, yet quickly wearied by them. The neat  edifice of her first mystic life was in <a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="green">p. 386</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_386"></a> ruins, the  state of consciousness which accompanied it was disintegrated, but  nothing arose to take its place.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p26"></a>“It is an amazing thing,” says Madame  Guyon naively, “for a soul that believed herself to be advanced  in the way of perfection, when she sees herself thus go to pieces all  at once.”   <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_791"><font size="1">792</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p28"></a>So, too, Suso, when he had entered the “upper  school” of the spiritual life, was tormented not only by  temptations and desolations, but by outward trials and disabilities of  every kind: calumnies, misunderstandings, difficulties, pains.  “It seemed at this time as if God had given permission both to  men and demons to torment the Servitor,” he says.   <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_792"><font size="1">793</font></a>
     This sense of a generally inimical atmosphere, and of the dimness and  helplessness of the Ego oppressed by circumstances, is like the vague  distress and nervous sensibility of adolescence, and comes in part  from the same cause: the intervening period of chaos between the  break-up of an old state of equilibrium and the establishment of the  new. The self, in its necessary movement towards higher levels of  reality, loses and leaves behind certain elements of its world, long  loved but now outgrown: as children must make the hard transition from  nursery to school. Destruction and construction here go together: the  exhaustion and ruin of the illuminated consciousness is the signal for  the onward movement of the self towards other centres: the feeling of  deprivation and inadequacy which comes from the loss of that  consciousness is an indirect stimulus to new growth. The self is being  pushed into a new world where it does not feel at home; has not yet  reached the point at which it enters into conscious possession of its  second or adult life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p30"></a>“Thou hast been a child at the breast, a spoiled  child,” said the Eternal Wisdom to Suso. “Now I will  withdraw all this.” In the resulting darkness and confusion,  when the old and known supports are thus withdrawn, the self can do  little but surrender itself to the inevitable process of things: to  the operation of that unresting Spirit of Life which is pressing it on  towards a new and higher state, in which it shall not only see Reality  but   <i>be</i>    real.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p31"></a>Psychologically, then, the “Dark Night of the  Soul” is due to the double fact of the exhaustion of an old  state, and the growth towards a new state of consciousness. It is a  “growing pain” in the organic process of the self’s  attainment of the Absolute. The great mystics, creative geniuses in  the realm of character, have known instinctively how to turn these  psychic disturbances to spiritual profit. Parallel with the mental  oscillations, upheavals and readjustments, through which an unstable  psycho-physical type moves to new centres of consciousness, run the  spiritual oscillations of a striving and ascending spiritual type.  <a name="an_iv.ix-p31.1"></a>   <i>Gyrans</i>    <a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="green">p. 387</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_387"></a>   <i>gyrando vadit spiritus</i>     .    The machinery of consciousness, over-stretched, breaks up, and seems  to toss the self back to an old and lower level, where it loses its  apprehensions of the transcendental world; as the child, when first it  is forced to stand alone, feels weaker than it did in its  mother’s arms.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p32"></a>“For first He not only withdraws all comfortable  observable infusions of light and grace, but also deprives her of a  power to exercise any perceptible operations of her superior spirit,  and of all comfortable reflections upon His love, plunging her into  the depth of her inferior powers,” says Augustine Baker, the  skilled director of souls, here anticipating the modern psychologist.  “Here consequently,” he continues, “her former  calmness of passions is quite lost, neither can she introvert herself;  sinful motions and suggestions do violently assault her, and she finds  as great difficulty (if not greater) to surmount them as at the  beginning of a spiritual course. . . . If she would elevate her  spirit, she sees nothing but clouds and darkness. She seeks God, and  cannot find the least marks or footsteps of His Presence; something  there is that hinders her from executing the sinful suggestions within  her but what that is she knows not, for to her thinking she has no  spirit at all, and, indeed, she is now in a region of all other most  distant from spirit and spiritual operations—I mean, such as are  perceptible.”   <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_793"><font size="1">794</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p34"></a>Such an interval of chaos and misery may last for  months, or even for years, before the consciousness again unifies  itself and a new centre is formed. Moreover, the negative side of this  new centre, this new consciousness of the Absolute, often discloses  itself first. The self realizes, that is to say, the inadequacy of its  old state, long before it grasps the possibility of a new and higher  state. This realization will take two forms; (  <i>a</i>   ) Objective: the distance or absence of the Absolute which the self  seeks, (  <i>b</i>   ) Subjective: the self’s weakness and imperfection. Both  apprehensions constitute a direct incentive to action. They present,  as it were, a Divine Negation which the self must probe, combat,  resolve. The Dark Night, therefore, largely the product of natural  causes, is the producer in its turn of mystical energy; and hence of  supernatural effects.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p35"></a>(2) So much for psychology. We have next to consider  the mystical or transcendental aspects of the Dark Night: see what it  has meant for those mystics who have endured it and for those  spiritual specialists who have studied it in the interests of other  men.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p36"></a>As in other phases of the Mystic Way, so here, we must  beware of any generalization which reduces the “Dark  Night” to a uniform <a name="page_388"><font size="1" color="green">p. 388</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_388"></a> experience; a neatly  defined state which appears under the same conditions, and attended by  the same symptoms, in all the selves who have passed through its  pains. It is a name for the painful and negative state which normally  intervenes between the Illuminative and the Unitive Life—no  more. Different types of contemplatives have interpreted it to  themselves and to us in different ways; each type of illumination  being in fact balanced by its own appropriate type of  “dark.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p37"></a>In some temperaments it is the emotional  aspect—the anguish of the lover who has suddenly lost the  Beloved—which predominates: in others, the intellectual darkness  and confusion overwhelms everything else. Some have felt it, with St.  John of the Cross, as a “passive purification,” a state of  helpless misery, in which the self does nothing, but lets Life have  its way with her. Others, with Suso and the virile mysticism of the  German school, have experienced it rather as a period of strenuous  activity and moral conflict directed to that “total  self-abandonment” which is the essential preparation of the  unitive life. Those elements of character which were unaffected by the  first purification of the self—left as it were in a corner when  the consciousness moved to the level of the illuminated life—are  here roused from their sleep, purged of illusion, and forced to join  the grooving stream.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p38"></a>The Dark Night, then, is really a deeply human  process, in which the self which thought itself so spiritual, so  firmly established upon the supersensual plane, is forced to turn  back, to leave the Light, and pick up those qualities which it had  left behind. Only thus, by the transmutation of the   <i>whole man,</i>    not by a careful and departmental cultivation of that which we like  to call his “spiritual” side, can Divine Humanity be  formed: and the formation of Divine Humanity—the remaking of man  “according to the pattern showed him in the  mount”—is the mystic’s only certain ladder to the  Real. “My humanity,” said the Eternal Wisdom to Suso,  “is the road which all must tread who would come to that which  thou seekest.”   <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_794"><font size="1">795</font></a>
     This “hard saying” might almost be used as a test by  which to distinguish the genuine mystic life from its many and  specious imitations. The self in its first purgation has cleansed the  mirror of perception; hence, in its illuminated life, has seen  Reality. In so doing it has transcended the normal perceptive powers  of “natural” man, immersed in the illusions of sense. Now,  it has got to   <i>be</i>    reality: a very different thing. For this a new and more drastic  purgation is needed—not of the organs of perception, but of the  very shrine of self: that “heart” which is the seat of  personality, the source of its love and will. In the stress and  anguish of the Night, when it turns back from the vision <a name="page_389"><font size="1" color="green">p. 389</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_389"></a> of the Infinite to feel again the limitations of the  finite the self loses the power to Do; and learns to surrender its  will to the operation of a larger Life, that it may Be. “At the  end of such a long and cruel transition,” says Lucie Christine,  “how much more supple the soul feels itself to be in the Hand of  God, how much more detached from all that is not God! She sees clearly  in herself the fruits of humility and patience, and feels her love  ascending more purely and directly to God in proportion as she has  realized the Nothingness of herself and all things.”   <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_795"><font size="1">796</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p41"></a>We must remember in the midst of our analysis, that  the mystic life is a life of love: that the Object of the  mystic’s final quest and of his constant intuition is an object  of adoration and supreme desire. “With Thee, a prison would be a  rose garden, oh Thou ravisher of hearts: with Thee, Hell would be  Paradise, oh Thou cheerer of souls,” said Jalalu ‘d Din.   <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_796"><font size="1">797</font></a>
     Hence for the mystic who has once known the Beatific Vision there can  be no greater grief than the withdrawal of this Object from his field  of consciousness; the loss of this companionship, the extinction of  this Light. Therefore, whatever form the “Dark Night”  assumes, it must entail bitter suffering: far worse than that endured  in the Purgative Way. Then the self was forcibly detached from the  imperfect. Now the Perfect is withdrawn, leaving behind an  overwhelming yet impotent conviction of something supremely wrong,  some final Treasure lost. We will now look at a few of the  characteristic forms under which this conviction is translated to the  surface-consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p43"></a>A. To those temperaments in which consciousness of the  Absolute took the form of a sense of divine companionship, and for  whom the objective idea “God” had become the central fact  of life, it seems as though that God, having shown Himself, has now  deliberately withdrawn His Presence, never perhaps to manifest Himself  again. “He acts,” says Eckhart, “as if there were a  wall erected between Him and us.”   <a name="fr_797"></a><a href="#fn_797"><font size="1">798</font></a>
     The “eye which looked upon Eternity” has closed, the old  dear sense of intimacy and mutual love has given place to a terrible  blank.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p45"></a>“That which this anguished soul feels most  deeply,” says St. John of the Cross, “is the conviction  that God has abandoned it,   <i>of</i>      <i>which it has no doubt;</i>    that He has cast it away into darkness as an abominable thing . . .  the shadow of death and the pains and torments of hell are most  acutely felt, and this comes from the sense of being abandoned by God,  being chastised and cast <a name="page_390"><font size="1" color="green">p. 390</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_390"></a> out by His wrath and heavy  displeasure. All this and even more the soul feels now, for a terrible  apprehension has come upon it that thus it will be with it for ever.  It has also the same sense of abandonment with respect to all  creatures, and that it is an object of contempt to all, especially to  its friends.”   <a name="fr_798"></a><a href="#fn_798"><font size="1">799</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p47"></a>So, too, Madame Guyon felt this loss of her intuitive  apprehension of God as one of the most terrible characteristics of the  “night.” “After Thou hadst wounded me so deeply as I  have described, Thou didst begin, oh my God, to withdraw Thyself from  me: and the pain of Thy absence was the more bitter to me, because Thy  presence had been so sweet to me, Thy love so strong in me. . . . Thy  way, oh my God, before Thou didst make me enter into the state of  death, was the way of the dying life: sometimes to hide Thyself and  leave me to myself in a hundred weaknesses, sometimes to show Thyself  with more sweetness and love. The nearer the soul drew to the state of  death, the more her desolations were long and weary, her weaknesses  increased, and also her joys became shorter, but purer and more  intimate, until the time in which she fell into total  privation.”   <a name="fr_799"></a><a href="#fn_799"><font size="1">800</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p49"></a>When this total privation or “mystic  death” is fully established, it involves not only the personal  “Absence of God,” but the apparent withdrawal or loss of  that impersonal support, that transcendent Ground or Spark of the  soul, on which the self has long felt its whole real life to be based.  Hence, its very means of contact with the spiritual world vanishes;  and as regards all that matters, it does indeed seem to be  “dead.” “When we have reached this total  deprivation,” says De Caussade, “what shall we do? Abide  in simplicity and peace, as Job on his ash heap, repeating,  ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit; those who have nothing have  all, since they have God.’ ‘Quit all, strip yourself of  all,’ says the great Gerson, ‘and you will have all in  God.’ ‘God felt, God tasted and enjoyed,’ says  Fénelon, ‘is indeed God, but God with those gifts which  flatter the soul. God in darkness, in privation, in forsakenness, in  insensibility, is so much God, that He is so to speak God bare and  alone. . . .’ Shall we fear this death, which is to produce in  us the true divine life of grace?”   <a name="fr_800"></a><a href="#fn_800"><font size="1">801</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p51"></a>B. In those selves for whom the subjective idea  “Sanctity”—the need of conformity between the  individual character and the Transcendent—has been central, the  pain of the Night is less a deprivation than a new and dreadful kind  of lucidity. The vision of the Good brings to the self an abrupt sense  of her own hopeless and helpless imperfection: a black  “conviction of sin,” far more bitter than that endured in  the Way of Purgation, which swamps <a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="green">p. 391</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_391"></a> everything else.  “That which makes her pain so terrible is that she is, as it  were, overwhelmed by the purity of God, and this purity makes her see  the least atoms of her imperfections as if they were enormous sins,  because of the infinite distance there is between the purity of God  and the creature.”   <a name="fr_801"></a><a href="#fn_801"><font size="1">802</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p53"></a>“This,” says St. John of the Cross again,  “is one of the most bitter sufferings of this purgation. The  soul is conscious of a profound emptiness in itself, a cruel  destitution of the three kinds of goods, natural, temporal, and  spiritual, which are ordained for its comfort. It sees itself in the  midst of the opposite evils, miserable imperfections, dryness and  emptiness of the understanding, and abandonment of the spirit in  darkness.”   <a name="fr_802"></a><a href="#fn_802"><font size="1">803</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p55"></a>C. Often combined with the sense of sin and the  “absence of God” is another negation, not the least  distressing part of the sufferings of the self suddenly plunged into  the Night. This is a complete emotional lassitude: the disappearance  of all the old ardours, now replaced by a callousness, a boredom,  which the self detests but cannot overcome. It is the dismal condition  of spiritual   <i>ennui</i>    which ascetic writers know so well under the name of  “aridity,” and which psychologists look upon as the result  of emotional fatigue.   <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">804</font></a>
     It seems incredible that the eager love of a Divine Companion, so  long the focus of the self’s whole being should have vanished:  that not only the transcendent vision should be withdrawn, but her  very desire for, and interest in, that vision should grow cold. Yet  the mystics are unanimous in declaring that this is a necessary stage  in the growth of the spiritual consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p57"></a>“When the sun begins to decline in the  heavens,” says Ruysbroeck, “it enters the sign Virgo;  which is so called because this period of the year is sterile as a  virgin.” This is the autumn season in the cycle of the soul,  when the summer heat grows less. “It perfects and fulfils the  yearly travail of the Sun. In the same manner, when Christ, that  glorious sun, has risen to His zenith in the heart of man, as I have  taught in the Third degree, and afterwards begins to decline, to hide  the radiance of His divine sunbeams, and to forsake the man; then the  heat and impatience of love grow less. Now that occultation of Christ,  and the withdrawal of His light and heat, are the first work and the  new coming of this degree. Now Christ says inwardly to this man,   <i>Go ye out in the manner which I now show you:</i>    and the man goes out and finds himself to be poor, miserable, and  abandoned. Here all the storm, the fury, the impatience of his love,  grow cool: glowing summer <a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="green">p. 392</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_392"></a> turns to autumn, all its  riches are transformed into a great poverty. And the man begins to  complain because of his wretchedness: for where now are the ardours of  love, the intimacy, the gratitude, the joyful praise, and the interior  consolation, the secret joy, the sensible sweetness? How have all  these things failed him? And the burning violence of his love, and all  the gifts which he felt before. How has all this died in him? And he  feels like some ignorant man who has lost all his learning and his  works . . . and of this misery there is born the fear of being lost,  and as it were a sort of half-doubt: and this is the lowest point at  which a man can hold his ground without falling into despair.”   <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">805</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p59"></a>D. This stagnation of the emotions has its counterpart  in the stagnation of the will and intelligence, which has been  experienced by some contemplatives as a part of their negative state.  As regards the will, there is a sort of moral dereliction: the self  cannot control its inclinations and thoughts. In the general psychic  turmoil, all the unpurified part of man’s inheritance, the lower  impulses and unworthy ideas which have long been imprisoned below the  threshold, force their way into the field of consciousness.  “Every vice was re-awakened within me,” says Angela of  Foligno, “I would have chosen rather to be roasted than to  endure such pains.”   <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">806</font></a>
     Where visual and auditory automatism is established, these irruptions  from the subliminal region often take the form of evil visions, or of  voices making coarse or sinful suggestions to the self. Thus St.  Catherine of Siena, in the interval between her period of joyous  illumination and her “spiritual marriage,” was tormented  by visions of fiends, who filled her cell and “with obscene  words and gestures invited her to lust.” She fled from her cell  to the church to escape them, but they pursued her there: and she  obtained no relief from this obsession until she ceased to oppose it.  She cried, “I have chosen suffering for my consolation, and will  gladly bear these and all other torments in the name of the Saviour,  for as long as it shall please His Majesty.” With this act of  surrender, the evil vision fled: Catherine swung back to a state of  affirmation, and was comforted by a vision of the Cross.   <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">807</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p62"></a>An analogous psychological state was experienced by  St. Teresa; though she fails to recognize it as an episode in her  normal development, and attributes it, with other spiritual adventures  for which she can find no other explanation, to the action of the  Devil. “The soul,” she says, “laid in fetters, loses  all control over itself, and all power of thinking of anything but the  absurdities he puts before it, which, being more or less  unsubstantial, inconsistent, and <a name="page_393"><font size="1" color="green">p. 393</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_393"></a> disconnected,  serve only to stifle the soul, so that it has no power over itself;  and accordingly—so it seems to me—the devils make a  football of it, and the soul is unable to escape out of their hands.  It is impossible to describe the sufferings of the soul in this state.  It goes about in quest of relief, and God suffers it to find none. The  light of reason, in the freedom of its will, remains, but it is not  clear; it seems to me as if its eyes were covered with a veil. . . .  Temptations seem to press it down, and make it dull, so that its  knowledge of God becomes to it as that of something which it hears of  far away.” This dullness and dimness extends to ordinary mental  activity, which shares in the lassitude and disorder of the inner  life. “If it seeks relief from the fire by spiritual reading, it  cannot find any, just as if it could not read at all. On one occasion  it occurred to me to read the life of a saint, that I might forget  myself and be refreshed with the recital of what he had suffered. Four  or five times, I read as many lines, and though they were written in  Spanish, I understood them less at the end than I did when I began: so  I gave it up. It so happened to me on more occasions than one.”   <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">808</font></a>
     If we are reminded of anything here, it is of the phenomenon of  “dark contemplation.” That dimness of mind which we there  studied, is here extended to the normal activities of the surface  intelligence. The Cloud of Unknowing, rolling up, seems to envelop the  whole self. Contemplation, the “way within the way,” has  epitomized the greater process of the mystic life. In both, the path  to Light lies through a meek surrender to the confusion and ignorance  of the “Dark.” The stress and exasperation felt in this  dark, this state of vague helplessness, by selves of an active and  self-reliant type, is exhibited by Teresa in one of her half-humorous  self-revealing flashes. “The Devil,” she says of it,  “then sends so offensive a spirit of bad temper that I think I  could eat people up!”   <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">809</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p65"></a>All these types of “darkness,” with their  accompanying and overwhelming sensations of impotence and distress,  are common in the lives of the mystics. Suso and Rulman Merswin  experienced them: Tauler constantly refers to them: Angela of Foligno  speaks of a “privation worse than hell.” It is clear that  even the joyous spirit of Mechthild of Magdeburg knew the sufferings  of the loss and absence of God. “Lord,” she says in one  place, “since Thou hast taken from me all that I had of Thee,  yet of Thy grace leave me the gift which every dog has by nature: that  of being true to Thee in my distress; when I am deprived of all  consolation. This I desire more fervently than Thy heavenly  Kingdom!”   <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">810</font></a>
     In such a saying as this, the whole “value for life” of  the Dark Night is <a name="page_394"><font size="1" color="green">p. 394</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_394"></a> revealed to us: as an education  in selfless constancy, a “school of suffering love.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p67"></a>E. There is, however, another way in which the  self’s sense of a continued imperfection in its relation with  the Absolute—of work yet remaining to be done—expresses  itself. In persons of a very highly strung and mobile type, who tend  to rapid oscillations between pain and pleasure states, rather than to  the long, slow movements of an ascending consciousness, attainment of  the Unitive Life is sometimes preceded by the abrupt invasion of a  wild and unendurable desire to “see God,” apprehend the  Transcendent in Its fullness: which can only, they think, be satisfied  by death. As they begin to outgrow their illuminated consciousness,  these selves begin also to realize how partial and symbolic that  consciousness—even at its best—has been: and their  movement to union with God is foreshadowed by a passionate and  uncontrollable longing for ultimate Reality. This passion is so  intense, that it causes acute anguish in those who feel it. It brings  with it all the helpless and desolate feelings of the Dark Night; and  sometimes rises to the heights of a negative rapture, an ecstasy of  deprivation. St. Teresa is perhaps the best instance of this rare  method of apprehending the self’s essential separation from its  home; which is also the subject of a celebrated chapter in the  <a name="an_iv.ix-p67.1"></a>“Traité de l’Amour de  Dieu” of St. François de Sales.   <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">811</font></a>
     Thanks to her exceptionally mobile temperament, her tendency to rush  up and down the scale of feeling, Teresa’s states of joyous  rapture were often paid for by such a “great  desolation”—a dark ecstasy or “pain of God.”  “As long as this pain lasts,” she says, “we cannot  even remember our own existence; for in an instant all the faculties  of the soul are so fettered as to lie incapable of any action save  that of increasing our torture. Do not think I am exaggerating; on the  contrary, that which I say is less than the truth, for lack of words  in which it may be expressed. This is a trance of the senses and the  faculties, save as regards all which helps to make the agony more  intense. The understanding realizes acutely what cause there is for  grief in separation from God: and our Lord increases this sorrow by a  vivid manifestation of Himself. The pain thus grows to such a degree  that in spite of herself the sufferer gives vent to loud cries, which  she cannot stifle, however patient and accustomed to pain she may be,  because this is not a pain which is felt in the body, but in the  depths of the soul. The person I speak of learned from this how much  more acutely the spirit is capable of suffering than the body.   <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">812</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p70"></a>The intense and painful concentration upon the Divine  Absence which takes place in this “dark rapture” often  induces all the <a name="page_395"><font size="1" color="green">p. 395</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_395"></a> psycho-physical marks of ecstasy.  “Although this state lasts but a short time, the limbs seem to  be disjointed by it. The pulse is as feeble as if one were at the  point of death; which is indeed the case, for whilst the natural heat  of the body fails, that which is supernatural so burns the frame that  with a few more degrees God would satisfy the soul’s desire for  death. . . . You will say perhaps, that there is imperfection in this  desire to see God: and ask why this soul does not conform herself to  His will, since she has so completely surrendered herself to it.  Hitherto she could do this, and consecrated her life to it; but now  she cannot, for her reason is reduced to such a state that she is no  longer mistress of herself and can think of nothing but her  affliction. Far from her Sovereign Good, why should she desire to  live? She feels an extraordinary loneliness, finds no companionship in  any earthly creature; nor could she I believe among those who dwell in  heaven, since they are not her Beloved. Meanwhile all company is  torture to her. She is like a person suspended in mid-air, who can  neither touch the earth, nor mount to heaven. She burns with a  consuming thirst, and cannot reach the water. And this is a thirst  which cannot be borne, but one which nothing will quench: nor would  she have it quenched with any other water than that of which our Lord  spoke to the Samaritan woman; and this water is denied her.”   <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">813</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p72"></a>All these forms of the Dark Night—the  “Absence of God,” the sense of sin, the dark ecstasy, the  loss of the self’s old passion, peace, and joy, and its apparent  relapse to lower spiritual and mental levels—are considered by  the mystics themselves to constitute aspects or parts of one and the  same process: the final purification of the will or stronghold of  personality, that it may be merged without any reserve “in God  where it was first.” The function of this episode of the Mystic  Way is to cure the soul of the innate tendency to seek and rest in  spiritual joys; to confuse Reality with the joy given by the  contemplation of Reality. It is the completion of that ordering of  disordered loves, that trans-valuation of values, which the Way of  Purgation began. The ascending self must leave these childish  satisfactions; make its love absolutely disinterested, strong, and  courageous, abolish all taint of spiritual gluttony. A total  abandonment of the individualistic standpoint, of that trivial and  egotistic quest of personal satisfaction which thwarts the great  movement of the Flowing Light, is the supreme condition of man’s  participation in Reality. Thus is true not only of the complete  participation which is possible to the great mystic, but of those  unselfish labours in which the initiates of science or of art become  to the Eternal Goodness <a name="page_396"><font size="1" color="green">p. 396</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_396"></a> “what his own hand is  to a man.” “Think not,” says Tauler, “that God  will be always caressing His children, or shine upon their head, or  kindle their hearts as He does at the first. He does so only to lure  us to Himself, as the falconer lures the falcon with its gay hood. . .  . We must stir up and rouse ourselves and be content to leave off  learning, and no more enjoy feeling and warmth, and must now serve the  Lord with strenuous industry and at our own cost.”   <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">814</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p74"></a>This manly view of the Dark Night, as a growth in  responsibility—an episode of character-building—in which,  as “The Mirror of Simple Souls” has it, “the soul  leaves that pride and play wherein it was full gladsome and  jolly,” is characteristic of the German mystics. We find it  again in Suso, to whom the angel of his tribulation gave no  sentimental consolations; but only the stern command, <a name="an_iv.ix-p74.1"></a>  <i>“Viriliter agite</i>   ”—“Be a man!” “Then  first,” says Tauler again, “do we attain to the fullness  of God’s love as His children, when it is no longer happiness or  misery, prosperity or adversity, that draws us to Him or keeps us back  from Him. What we should then experience none can utter; but it would  be something far better than when we were burning with the first flame  of love, and had great emotion, but less true submission.”   <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">815</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p76"></a>In Illumination, the soul, basking in the Uncreated  Light, identified the Divine Nature with the divine light and  sweetness which it then enjoyed. Its consciousness of the transcendent  was chiefly felt as an increase of personal vision and personal joy.  Thus, in that apparently selfless state, the “I, the Me, the  Mine,” though spiritualized, still remained intact. The  mortification of the senses was more than repaid by the rich and happy  life which this mortification conferred upon the soul. But before real  and permanent union with the Absolute can take place: before the whole  self can learn to live on those high levels where—its being  utterly surrendered to the Infinite Will—it can be wholly  transmuted in God, merged in the great life of the All, this  dependence on personal joys must be done away. The spark of the soul,  the fast-growing germ of divine humanity, must so invade every corner  of character that the self can only say with St. Catherine of Genoa,  “My   <i>me</i>    is God: nor do I know my selfhood except in God.”   <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">816</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p78"></a>The various torments and desolations of the Dark Night  constitute this last and drastic purgation of the spirit; the doing  away of separateness, the annihilation of selfhood, even though all  that self now claims for its own be the Love of God. Such a  claim—which is really a claim to entire felicity, since the soul  which possesses it needs nothing more—is felt by these great  spirits to <a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="green">p. 397</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_397"></a> sully the radiance of their self-giving  love. “All that I would here say of these inward delights and  enjoyments,” says William Law, “is only this; they are not  holiness, they are not piety, they are not perfection; but they are  God’s gracious allurements and calls to seek after holiness and  spiritual perfection . . . and ought rather to convince us that we are  as yet but   <i>babes,</i>    than that we are ready   <i>men</i>    of God. . . . This alone is the true Kingdom of God opened in the  soul when, stripped of all selfishness, it has only one love and one  will in it; when it has no motion or desire but what branches from the  Love of God, and resigns itself wholly to the Will of God. . . . To  sum up all in a word: Nothing hath separated us from God but our own  will, or rather our own will is our separation from God. All the  disorder and corruption and malady of our nature lies in a certain  fixedness of our own will, imagination, and desire, wherein we live to  ourselves, are our own centre and circumference, act wholly from  ourselves, according to our own will, imagination, and desires. There  is not the smallest degree of evil in us but what arises from this  selfishness because we are thus all in all to ourselves. . . . To be  humble, mortified, devout, patient in a certain degree, and to be  persecuted for our virtues, is no hurt to this selfishness; nay,   <i>spiritual-self</i>    must have all these virtues to subsist upon, and his life consists in  seeing, knowing and feeling the bulk, strength, and reality of them.  But still, in all this show and glitter of virtue, there is an  unpurified bottom on which they stand, there is a selfishness which  can no more enter into the Kingdom of Heaven than the grossness of  flesh and blood can enter into it. What we are to feel and undergo in  these last purifications, when the deepest root of all selfishness, as  well spiritual as natural, is to be plucked up and torn from us, or  how we shall be able to stand in that trial, are both of them equally  impossible to be known by us beforehand.”   <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">817</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p80"></a>The self, then, has got to learn to cease to be its  “own centre and circumference”: to make that final  surrender which is the price of final peace. In the Dark Night the  starved and tortured spirit learns through an anguish which is  “itself an orison” to accept lovelessness for the sake of  Love, Nothingness for the sake of the All; dies without any sure  promise of life, loses when it hardly hopes to find. It sees with  amazement the most sure foundations of its transcendental life crumble  beneath it, dwells in a darkness which seems to hold no promise of a  dawn. This is what the German mystics call the “upper school of  true resignation” or of “suffering love”; the last  test of heroic detachment, of manliness, of spiritual courage. Though  such an experience is <a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="green">p. 398</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_398"></a> “passive” in the  sense that the self can neither enter nor leave it at will it is a  direct invitation to active endurance, a condition of stress in which  work is done. Thus, when St. Catherine of Siena was tormented by  hideous visions of sin, she was being led by her deeper self to the  heroic acceptance of this subtle form of torture, almost unendurable  to her chaste and delicate mind. When these trials had brought her to  the point at which she ceased to resist them, but exclaimed, “I  have chosen suffering for my consolation,” their business was  done. They ceased. More significant still, when she asked,  “Where wast Thou, Lord, when I was tormented by this  foulness?” the Divine Voice answered, “I was in thy  heart.”   <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">818</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p82"></a>“In order to raise the soul from  imperfection,” said the Voice of God to St. Catherine in her  Dialogue, “I withdraw Myself from her sentiment, depriving her  of former consolations . . . which I do in order to humiliate her, and  cause her to seek Me in truth, and to prove her in the light of faith,  so that she come to prudence. Then, if she love Me without thought of  self, and with lively faith and with hatred of her own sensuality, she  rejoices in the time of trouble, deeming herself unworthy of peace and  quietness of mind. Now comes the second of the three things of which I  told thee, that is to say: how the soul arrives at perfection, and  what she does when she is perfect. That is what she does. Though she  perceives that I have withdrawn Myself, she does not, on that account,  look back; but perseveres with humility in her exercises, remaining  barred in the house of self-knowledge, and, continuing to dwell  therein, awaits with lively faith the coming of the Holy Spirit, that  is of Me, who am the Fire of Love. . . . This is what the soul does in  order to rise from imperfection and arrive at perfection, and it is to  this end, namely, that she may arrive at perfection, that I withdraw  from her, not by grace, but by sentiment. Once more do I leave her so  that she may see and know her defects, so that feeling herself  deprived of consolation and afflicted by pain, she may recognize her  own weakness, and learn how incapable she is of stability or  perseverance, thus cutting down to the very root of spiritual  self-love: for this should be the end and purpose of all her  self-knowledge, to rise above herself, mounting the throne of  conscience, and not permitting the sentiment of imperfect love to turn  again in its death-struggle, but with correction and reproof digging  up the root of self-love with the knife of self-hatred and the love of  virtue.”   <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">819</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p84"></a>“Digging up the root of self-love with the knife  of self-hatred”—here we see the mystical reason of that  bitter self-contempt and sense of helplessness which overwhelms the  soul in the Dark Night.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p85"></a>Such a sense of helplessness is really, the mystics  say, a mark of <a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="green">p. 399</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_399"></a> progress: of deeper initiation into  that sphere of reality to which it is not yet acclimatized, and which  brings with it a growing consciousness of the appalling disparity  between that Reality, that Perfection, and the imperfect soul.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p86"></a>The self is in the dark because it is blinded by a  Light greater than it can bear—that “Divine Wisdom which  is not only night and darkness to the soul, but pain and torment  too.” “The more clear the light, the more does it blind  the eyes of the owl, and the more we try to look at the sun the  feebler grows our sight and the more our weak eyes are darkened. So  the divine light of contemplation, when it beats on the soul not yet  perfectly purified, fills it with spiritual darkness, not only because  of its brilliance, but because it paralyses the natural perception of  the soul. The pain suffered by the soul is like that endured by weak  or diseased eyes when suddenly struck by a strong light. Such  suffering is intense when the yet unpurified soul finds itself invaded  by this cleansing light. For in this pure light, which attacks its  impurities to expel them, the soul perceives itself to be so unclean  and miserable that it seems as if God had set Himself against it. . .  . Wonderful and piteous sight! so great are the weakness and  imperfection of the soul that the hand of God, so soft and so gentle,  is felt to be so heavy and oppressive, though merely touching it, and  that, too, most mercifully; for He touches the soul, not to chastise  it, but to load it with His graces.”   <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">820</font></a>

 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p88"></a>The Dark Night then, whichever way we look at it, is a  state of disharmony; of imperfect adaptation to environment. The self,  unaccustomed to that direct contact of the Absolute which is destined  to become the Source of its vitality and its joy, feels the  “soft and gentle touch” of the Following Love as  unbearable in its weight. The “self-naughting” or  “purification of the will,” which here takes place, is the  struggle to resolve that disharmony; to purge away the somewhat which  still sets itself up in the soul as separate from the Divine, and  makes the clear light of reality a torment instead of a joy. So deeply  has the soul now entered into the great stream of spiritual life, so  dominant has her transcendental faculty become, that this process is  accomplished in her whether she will or no: and in this sense it is,  as ascetic writers sometimes call it, a “passive  purgation.” So long as the subject still feels himself to be   <i>somewhat,</i>    he has not yet annihilated selfhood and come to that ground where his  being can be united with the Being of God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p89"></a>Only when he learns to cease thinking of himself at  all, in however depreciatory a sense; when he abolishes even such  selfhood as lies in a desire for the sensible presence of God, will  that <a name="page_400"><font size="1" color="green">p. 400</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_400"></a> harmony be attained. This is the  “naughting of the soul,” the utter surrender to the great  movement of the Absolute Life, which is insisted upon at such length  by all writers upon mysticism. Here, as in purgation, the condition of  access to higher levels of vitality is a death: a deprivation, a  detachment, a clearing of the ground. Poverty leaps to the Cross: and  finds there an utter desolation, without promise of spiritual reward.  The satisfactions of the spirit must now go the same way as the  satisfactions of the senses. Even the power of voluntary sacrifice and  self-discipline is taken away. A dreadful   <i>ennui,</i>    a dull helplessness, takes its place. The mystic motto,   <i>I am nothing, I have nothing, I desire nothing,</i>    must now express not only the detachment of the senses, but the whole  being’s surrender to the All.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p90"></a>The moral condition towards which the interior travail  is directed is that of an utter humility. “Everything  depends,” says Tauler, on “a fathomless sinking in a  fathomless nothingness.” He continues, “If a man were to  say, ‘Lord, who art Thou, that I must follow Thee through such  deep, gloomy, miserable paths?’ the Lord would reply, ‘I  am God and Man, and far more God.’ If a man could answer then,  really and consciously from the bottom of his heart. ‘Then I am  nothing and less than nothing’; all would be accomplished, for  the Godhead has really no place to work in, but ground where all has  been annihilated.   <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">821</font></a>
     As the schoolmen say, when a new form is to come into existence, the  old must of necessity be destroyed. . . . And so I say: ‘If a  man is to be thus clothed upon with this Being, all the forms must of  necessity be done away that were ever received by him in all his  powers—of perception, knowledge, will, work, of subjection,  sensibility and self-seeking.’ When St. Paul saw nothing, he saw  God. So also when Elias wrapped his face in his mantle, God came. All  strong rocks are broken here, all on which the spirit can rest must be  done away. Then, when all forms have ceased to exist, in the twinkling  of an eye the man is transformed. Therefore thou must make an  entrance. Thereupon speaks the Heavenly Father to him: “Thou  shalt call Me Father, and shalt never cease to enter in; entering ever  further in, ever nearer, so as to sink the deeper in an unknown and  unnamed abyss; and, above all ways, images and forms, and above all  powers, to lose thyself, deny thyself, and even unform thyself.’  In this lost condition nothing is to be seen but a ground which rests  upon itself, everywhere one Being, one Life. It is thus, man may say,  that he becomes unknowing, unloving, and senseless.”   <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">822</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p93"></a>It is clear that so drastic a process of unselfing is  not likely <a name="page_401"><font size="1" color="green">p. 401</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_401"></a> to take place without stress. It is the  negative aspect of “deification”: in which the self,  deprived of “perception, knowledge, will, work,  self-seeking”—the I, the Me, the Mine—loses itself,  denies itself, unforms itself, drawing “ever nearer” to  the One, till “nothing is to be seen but a ground which rests  upon itself”—the ground of the soul, in which it has union  with God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p94"></a>“Everywhere one Being, one  Life”—this is the goal of mystical activity; the final  state of equilibrium towards which the self is moving, or rather  struggling, in the dimness and anguish of the Dark Night. “The  soul,” says Madame Guyon in a passage of unusual beauty,  “after many a redoubled death, expires at last in the arms of  Love; but she is unable to perceive these arms. . . . Then, reduced to  Nought, there is found in her ashes a seed of immortality, which is  preserved in these ashes and will germinate in its season. But she  knows not this; and does not expect ever to see herself living  again.” Moreover, “the soul which is reduced to the  Nothing, ought to dwell therein; without wishing, since she is now but  dust, to issue from this state, nor, as before, desiring to live  again. She must remain as something which no longer exists: and this,  in order that the Torrent may drown itself and lose itself in the Sea,  never to find itself in its selfhood again: that it may become one and  the same thing with the Sea.”   <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">823</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p96"></a>So Hilton says of the “naughted soul,”  “the less it thinketh that it loveth or seeth God, the nearer it  nigheth for to perceive the gift of the blessed love. For then is love  master, and worketh in the soul, and maketh it for to forget itself,  and for to see and behold only how love doth. And then is the soul  more suffering than doing, and that is clean love.”   <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">824</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p98"></a>The “mystic death” or Dark Night is  therefore an aspect or incident of the transition from multiplicity to  Unity, of that mergence and union of the soul with the Absolute which  is the whole object of the mystical evolution of man. It is the last  painful break with the life of illusion, the tearing away of the self  from that World of Becoming in which all its natural affections and  desires are rooted, to which its intellect and senses correspond; and  the thrusting of it into that World of Being where at first, weak and  blinded, it can but find a wilderness, a “dark.” No  transmutation without fire, say the alchemists: No cross, no crown,  says the Christian. All the great experts of the spiritual life  agree—whatever their creeds, their symbols, their  explanations—in describing this stress, tribulation, and  loneliness, as an essential part of the way from the Many to the One;  bringing the self to the threshold of that completed life which is to  be lived in intimate union with <a name="page_402"><font size="1" color="green">p. 402</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_402"></a> Reality. It is the  Entombment which precedes the Resurrection, say the Christian mystics;  ever ready to describe their life-process in the language of their  faith. Here as elsewhere—but nowhere else in so drastic a  sense—the self must “lose to find and die to  live.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p99"></a>The Dark Night, as we have seen, tends to establish  itself gradually; the powers and intuitions of the self being  withdrawn one after another, the intervals of lucidity becoming rarer,  until the “mystic death” or state of total deprivation is  reached. So, too, when the night begins to break down before the  advance of the new or Unitive Life, the process is generally slow,  though it may be marked—as for instance in Rulman  Merswin’s case—by visions and ecstasies.   <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">825</font></a>
     One after another, the miseries and disharmonies of the Dark Night  give way: affirmation takes the place of negation: the Cloud of  Unknowing is pierced by rays of light.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p101"></a>The act of complete surrender then, which is the term  of the Dark Night, has given the self its footing in Eternity: its  abandonment of the old centres of consciousness has permitted movement  towards the new. In each such forward movement, the Transcendental  Self, that spark of the soul which is united to the Absolute Life, has  invaded more and more the seat of personality; stage by stage the  remaking of the self in conformity with the Eternal World has gone on.  In the misery and apparent stagnation of the Dark Night—that  dimness of the spiritual consciousness, that dullness of its will and  love—work has been done, and the last great phase of the inward  transmutation accomplished. The self which comes forth from the night  is no separated self, conscious of the illumination of the Uncreated  Light, but the New Man, the transmuted humanity, whose life is   <i>one</i>    with the Absolute Life of God. “As soon as the two houses of  the soul [the sensual and the spiritual],” says St. John of the  Cross, “are tranquil and confirmed and merged in one by this  peace, and their servants the powers, appetites and passions are sunk  in deep tranquillity, neither troubled by things above nor things  below, the Divine Wisdom immediately unites itself to the soul in a  new bond of loving possession, and that is fulfilled which is written  in the Book of Wisdom: ‘While all things were immersed in quiet  silence, and the night was in the midway of her course, Thy omnipotent  Word sallied out of heaven from the royal seats’ (<a name="an_iv.ix-p101.1"></a><a href="../../bib/apo/wis018.htm#014">Wisdom xviii. 14</a><a name="an_iv.ix-p101.1"></a>). The same truth is set before us in the Canticle, where the Bride,  after passing by those who took her veil away and wounded her, saith,  ‘When I had a little passed by them I found Him Whom my soul  loveth’ (<a name="an_iv.ix-p101.2"></a><a href="../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004">Cant. iii. 4</a><a name="an_iv.ix-p101.2"></a>).”   <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">826</font></a>

 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p103"></a>* * * * *</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p104"></a><a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="green">p. 403</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_403"></a> So far, we have considered the Dark  Night of the Soul from a somewhat academic point of view. We have  tried to dissect and describe it: have seen it through the medium of  literature rather than life. Such a method has obvious disadvantages  when dealing with any organic process: and when it is applied to the  spiritual life of man, these disadvantages are increased. Moreover,  our chief example, “from the life,” Madame Guyon, valuable  as her passion for self analysis makes her to the student of mystic  states cannot be looked upon as a satisfactory witness. Her morbid  sentimentalism, her absurd “spiritual self-importance”  have to be taken into account and constantly remembered in estimating  the value of her psychological descriptions. If we want to get a true  idea of the Dark Night, as an episode in the history of a living soul,  we must see it in its context, as part of that soul’s total  experience. We must study the reactions of a self which is passing  through this stage of development upon its normal environment the  content of its diurnal existence; not only on its intuition of the  Divine.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p105"></a>As a pendant to this chapter, then, we will look at  this “state of pain” as it expressed itself in the life of  a mystic whose ardent, impressionable, and poetic nature reacted to  every aspect of the contemplative experience, every mood and  fluctuation of the soul. I choose this particular case—the case  of Suso—(1) because it contains many interesting and  unconventional elements; showing us the Dark Night not as a series of  specific moods and events, but as a phase of growth largely  conditioned by individual temperament: (2) because, being told at  first hand, in the pages of his singularly ingenuous autobiography,  the record is comparatively free from the reverent and corrupting  emendations of the hagiographer.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p106"></a>From the 22nd chapter onwards, Suso’s  “Life” is one of the most valuable documents we possess  for the study of this period of the Mystic Way. We see in  it—more clearly perhaps than its author can have done—the  remaking of his consciousness, his temperamental reactions to the  ceaseless travail of his deeper self: so different in type from those  of St. Teresa and Madame Guyon. There is a note of virile activity  about these trials and purifications, an insistence upon the heroic  aspect of the spiritual life, far more attractive than Madame  Guyon’s elaborate discourses on resignation and holy passivity,  or even St. Teresa’s “dark ecstasies” of insatiable  desire.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p107"></a>The chapter in which Suso’s entrance into this  “Second Mystic Life” of deprivation is described is called  “How the Servitor was led into the School of True  Resignation.” Characteristically, this inward experience  expressed itself in a series of dramatic visions; <a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="green">p. 404</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_404"></a>  visions of that “dynamic” kind which we have noticed as a  frequent accompaniment of the crisis in which the mystic self moves to  a new level of consciousness.   <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">827</font></a>
     It followed the long period of constant mortification and  intermittent illumination which lasted, as he tells us, from his  eighteenth to his fortieth year: and constituted the first cycle of  his spiritual life. At the end of that time, “God showed him  that all this severity and these penances were but a good beginning,  that by these he had triumphed over the unruly sensual man: but that  now he must exert himself in another manner if he desired to advance  in the Way.”   <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">828</font></a>
     In two of these visions—these vivid interior dramas—we  seem to see Suso’s developed mystical consciousness running  ahead of its experience, reading the hidden book of its own future,  probing its own spiritual necessities; and presenting the results to  the backward and unwilling surface-mind. This growing mystic  consciousness is already aware of fetters which the normal Suso does  not feel. Its eyes open upon the soul’s true country, it sees  the path which it must tread to perfect freedom; the difference  between the quality of that freedom, and the spirituality which Suso  thinks that he has attained. The first of these visions is that of the  Upper School; the second is that in which he is called to put upon him  the armour of a knight.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p110"></a>“One night after matins, the Servitor being  seated in his chair, and plunged in deep thought, he was rapt from his  senses. And it seemed to him that he saw in a vision a magnificent  young man descend from Heaven before him, and say, “thou hast  been long enough in the Lower School, and hast there sufficiently  applied thyself. Come, then, with me; and I will introduce thee into  the highest school that exists in this world.   <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">829</font></a>
     There, thou shalt apply thyself to the study of that science which  will procure thee the veritable peace of God; and which will bring thy  holy beginning to a happy end.’ Then the Servitor rose, full of  joy; and it seemed to him that the young man took him by the hand and  led him into a spiritual country, wherein there was a fair house  inhabited by spiritual men: for here lived those who applied  themselves to the study of this science. As soon as he entered it,  these received him kindly, and amiably saluted him. And at once they  went to the supreme Master, and told him that a man was come, who  desired to be his disciple and to learn his science. And he said,  ‘Let him <a name="page_405"><font size="1" color="green">p. 405</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_405"></a> come before me, that I may see  whether he please me.’ And when the supreme Master saw the  Servitor, he smiled on him very kindly, and said, ‘Know that  this guest is able to become a good disciple of our high science, if  he will bear with patience the hard probation: for it is necessary  that he be tried inwardly.’</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p112"></a>“The Servitor did not then understand these  enigmatic words. He turned toward the young man who had brought him  and asked, ‘Well, my dear comrade, what then is this Upper  School and this science of which you have spoken to me?’ The  young man replied thus: ‘In this Upper School they teach the  science of Perfect Self-abandonment; that is to say, that a man is  here taught to renounce himself so utterly that, in all those  circumstances in which God is manifested, either by Himself or in His  creatures, the man applies himself only to remaining calm and unmoved  renouncing so far as is possible all human frailty.’ And shortly  after this discourse, the Servitor came to himself . . . and, talking  to himself, he said, ‘Examine thyself inwardly and thou wilt see  that thou hast still much self-will: thou wilt observe, that with all  thy mortifications which thou hast inflicted on thyself, thou canst  not yet endure external vexations. Thou art like a hare hiding in a  bush, who is frightened by the whispering of the leaves. Thou also art  frightened every day by the griefs that come to thee: thou dost turn  pale at the sight of those who speak against thee: when thou doest  fear to succumb, thou takest flight; when thou oughtest to present  thyself with simplicity, thou dost hide thyself. When they praise  thee, thou art happy: when they blame thee, thou art sad. Truly is it  very needful for thee that thou shouldst go to an Upper School.”   <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">830</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p114"></a>Some weeks later, when he had been rejoicing in the  new bodily comfort which resulted from his relinquishment of all  outward mortifications, Suso received a still more pointed lesson on  his need of moral courage. He was sitting on his bed and meditating on  the words of Job <a name="an_iv.ix-p114.1"></a>  <i>“Militia est.”</i>   “The life of man upon the earth is like unto  that of a knight”:   <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">831</font></a>
     “and during this meditation, he was once more rapt from his  senses, and it seemed to him that he saw coming towards him a fair  youth of manly bearing, who held in his hands the spurs and the other  apparel which knights are accustomed to wear. And he drew near to the  Servitor, and clothed him in a coat of mail, and said to him,  ‘Oh, knight! hitherto thou hast been but a squire, but now it is  God’s will that thou be raised to knighthood.’ And the  Servitor gazed at his spurs, and said with much amazement in his  heart, ‘Alas, my God! what has befallen me? what have I become?  must I indeed be a knight? I had far rather remain in peace.’  Then he <a name="page_406"><font size="1" color="green">p. 406</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_406"></a> said to the young man, ‘Since it is  God’s will that I should be a knight I had rather have won my  spurs in battle; for this would have been more glorious.’ The  young man turned away and began to laugh: and said to him, ‘Have  no fear! thou shalt have battles enough. He who would play a valiant  part in the spiritual chivalry of God must endure more numerous and  more dreadful combats than any which were encountered by the proud  heroes of ancient days, of whom the world tells and sings the knightly  deeds. It is not that God desires to free thee from thy burdens; He  would only change them and make them far heavier than they have ever  been.’ Then the Servitor said, ‘Oh, Lord, show me my pains  in advance, in order that I may know them.’ The Lord replied,  ‘No, it is better that thou know nothing, lest thou shouldst  hesitate. But amongst the innumerable pains which thou wilt have to  support, I will tell thee three. The first is this. Hitherto it is  thou who hast scourged thyself, with thine own hands: thou didst cease  when it seemed good to thee, and thou hadst compassion on thyself.  Now, I would take thee from thyself, and cast thee without defence  into the hands of strangers who shall scourge thee. Thou shalt see the  ruin of thy reputation. Thou shalt be an object of contempt to blinded  men; and thou shalt suffer more from this than from the wounds made by  the points of thy cross.   <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">832</font></a>
     When thou didst give thyself up to thy penances thou wert exalted and  admired. Now thou shalt be abased and annihilated. The second pain is  this: Although thou didst inflict on thyself many cruel tortures,  still by God’s grace there remained to thee a tender and loving  disposition. It shall befall thee, that there where thou hadst thought  to find a special and a faithful love, thou shalt find nought but  unfaithfulness, great sufferings, and great griefs. Thy trials shall  be so many that those men who have any love for thee shall suffer with  thee by compassion. The third pain is this: hitherto thou hast been  but a child at the breast, a spoiled child. Thou hast been immersed in  the divine sweetness like a fish in the sea. Now I will withdraw all  this. It is my will that thou shouldst be deprived of it, and that  thou suffer from this privation, that thou shouldst be abandoned of  God and of man, that thou shouldst be publicly persecuted by the  friends of thine enemies. I will tell it thee in a word: all thou  shalt undertake, that might bring thee joy and consolation, shall come  to nothing, and all that might make thee suffer and be vexatious to  thee shall succeed.’”   <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">833</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p118"></a>Observe here, under a highly poetic and visionary  method of presentation, the characteristic pains of the Dark Night as  <a name="page_407"><font size="1" color="green">p. 407</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_407"></a> described by St. John of the Cross, Madame Guyon,  De Caussade and almost every expert who has written upon this state of  consciousness. Desolation and loneliness, abandonment by God and by  man, a tendency of everything to “go wrong,” a profusion  of unsought trials and griefs—all are here. Suso, naturally  highly strung, sensitive and poetic, suffered acutely in this mental  chaos and multiplication of woes. He was tormented by a deep  depression so that “it seemed as though a mountain weighed on  his heart” by doubts against faith: by temptations to despair.   <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">834</font></a>
     These miseries lasted for about ten years. They were diversified and  intensified by external trials, such as illnesses and false  accusations; and relieved, as the years of purgation had been, by  occasional visions and revelations.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p120"></a>Suso’s natural tendency was to an enclosed life:  to secret asceticism, reverie, outbursts of fervent devotion, long  hours of rapt communion with the Eternal Wisdom whom he loved. At once  artist and recluse, utterly unpractical, he had all the  dreamer’s dread of the world of men. His deeper self now ran  counter to all these preferences. Like the angel which said to him in  the hour of his utmost prostration and misery, <a name="an_iv.ix-p120.1"></a>“  <i>Viriliter agite!”</i>      <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">835</font></a>
    it pressed him inexorably towards the more manly part; pushing him to  action, sending him out from his peaceful if uncomfortable cell to the  rough-and-tumble of the world. Poor Suso was little fitted by nature  for that rough-and-tumble: and a large part of his autobiography is  concerned with the description of all that he endured therein. The  Dark Night for him was emphatically an “active night”; and  the more active he was forced to be, the darker and more painful it  became. Chapter after chapter is filled with the troubles of the  unhappy Servitor; who, once he began to meddle with practical life,  soon disclosed his native simplicity and lost the reputation for  wisdom and piety which he had gained during his years of  seclusion.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p122"></a>There was not in Suso that high-hearted gaiety, that  child-like courage, which made the early Franciscans delight to call  themselves God’s fools. The bewildered lover of the Eternal  Wisdom suffered acutely from his loss of dignity; from the  unfriendliness and contempt of other men. He gives a long and dismal  catalogue of the enemies that he made, the slanders which he endured,  in the slow acquirement of that disinterested and knightly valour  which had been revealed to him as the essential virtue of the squire  who would “ride with the Eternal Wisdom in the lists.”   <a name="fr_835"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">836</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p124"></a>Suso was a born romantic. This dream of a spiritual  chivalry <a name="page_408"><font size="1" color="green">p. 408</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_408"></a> haunts him: again and again he uses the  language of the tournament in his description of the mystic life. Yet  perhaps few ideals seem less appropriate to this timid, highly-strung,  unpractical Dominican friar: this ecstatic “minnesinger of the  Holy Ghost,” half-poet, half-metaphysician, racked by  ill-health, exalted by mystical ardours, instinctively fearing the  harsh contact of his fellow-men.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p125"></a>There is no grim endurance about Suso: he feels every  hard knock, and all the instincts of his nature are in favour of  telling his griefs. A more human transcendentalist has never lived.  Thanks to the candour and completeness with which he takes his readers  into his confidence, we know him far more intimately than we do any of  the other great contemplatives. There is one chapter in his life in  which he describes with the utmost ingenuousness how he met a  magnificent knight whilst crossing the Lake of Constance; and was  deeply impressed by his enthusiastic descriptions of the glories and  dangers of the lists. The conversation between the tough man at arms  and the hypersensitive mystic is full of revealing touches. Suso is  exalted and amazed by the stories of hard combats, the courage of the  knights, and the ring for which they contend: but most astounded by  the fortitude which pays no attention to its wounds.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p126"></a>“And may not one weep, and show that one is  hurt, when one is hit very hard?” he says.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p127"></a>The knight replies, “No, even though one’s  heart fails, as happens to many, one must never show that one is  distressed. One must appear gay and happy; otherwise one is  dishonoured, and loses at the same time one’s reputation and the  Ring.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p128"></a>“These words made the Servitor thoughtful; and  he was greatly moved, and inwardly sighing he said, ‘Oh Lord, if  the knights of this world must suffer so much to obtain so small a  prize, how just it is that we should suffer far more if we are to  obtain an eternal recompense! Oh, my sweet Lord, if only I were worthy  of being Thy spiritual knight!”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p129"></a>Arrived at his destination, however, Suso was visited  by fresh trials: and soon forgetting his valiant declarations, he  began as usual to complain of his griefs. The result was a visionary  ecstasy, in which he heard the voice of that deeper self to which he  always attributed a divine validity, inquiring with ill-concealed  irony, “Well, what has become of that noble chivalry? Who is  this knight of straw, this rag-made man? It is not by making rash  promises and drawing back when suffering comes, that men win the Ring  of Eternity which you desire.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p130"></a>“Alas! Lord,” said Suso plaintively,  “the tournaments in which one must suffer for Thee last such a  very long time!” <a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="green">p. 409</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_409"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p131"></a>The voice replied, “But the reward, the honour,  and the Ring which I give to My knights endure for ever.”   <a name="fr_836"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">837</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p140"></a>As his mystic consciousness grew, the instinct  pressing him towards action and endurance grew with it. The inner  voice and its visionary expression urged him on remorselessly. It  mocked his weakness, encouraged him to more active suffering, more  complete self-renunciation: more contact with the unfriendly world.   <i>Viriliter agile!</i>    He must be a complete personality; a whole man. Instead of the quiet  cell, the secret mortifications, his selfhood was to be stripped from  him, and the reality of his renunciation tested, under the  unsympathetic and often inimical gaze of other men. The case of Suso  is one that may well give pause to those who regard the mystic life as  a progress in passivity, withdrawal from the actual world: and the  “Dark Night” as one of its most morbid manifestations.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p141"></a>It is interesting to observe how completely human and  apparently “unmystical” was the culminating trial by which  Suso was “perfected in the school of true resignation.”  “None can come to the sublime heights of the divinity,”  said the Eternal Wisdom to him in one of his visions, “or taste  its ineffable sweetness, if first they have not experienced the  bitterness and lowliness of My humanity. The higher they climb without  passing by My humanity, the lower afterward shall be their fall. My  humanity is the road which all must tread who would come to that which  thou seekest: My sufferings are the door by which all must come  in.”   <a name="fr_837"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">838</font></a>
     It was by the path of humanity; by some of the darkest and most  bitter trials of human experience, the hardest tests of its patience  and love, that Suso “came in” to that sustained peace of  heart and union with the divine will which marked his last state. The  whole tendency of these trials in the “path of humanity”  seems, as we look at them, to be directed towards the awakening of  those elements of character left dormant by the rather specialized  disciplines and purifications of his cloistered life. We seem to see  the “new man” invading all the resistant or inactive  corners of personality: the Servitor of Wisdom being pressed against  his will to a deeply and widely human life in the interests of Eternal  <a name="page_410"><font size="1" color="green">p. 410</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_410"></a> Love. The absence of God whom he loved, the enmity  of man whom he feared, were the chief forces brought to play upon him:  and we watch his slow growth, under their tonic influence, in courage,  humility, and fraternal love.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p143"></a>Few chapters in the history of the mystics are more  touching than that passage in Suso’s Life.   <a name="fr_838"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">839</font></a>
     “Where we speak of an extraordinary Trial which the Servitor  had to bear.” It tells how a malicious woman accused him of  being the father of her child, and succeeded for the time in entirely  destroying his reputation. “And the scandal was all the  greater,” says the Servitor with his customary simplicity  “because the rumour of that brother’s sanctity had spread  so far.” Poor Suso was utterly crushed by this calumny,  “wounded to the depths of his heart.” “Lord,  Lord!” he cried, “every day of my life I have worshipped  Thy holy Name in many places, and have helped to cause it to be loved  and honoured by many men: and now Thou wouldst drag my name through  the mud!” When the scandal was at its height, a woman of the  neighbourhood came to him in secret; and offered to destroy the child  which was the cause of this gossip, in order that the tale might be  more quickly forgotten and his reputation restored. She said further  that unless the baby were somehow disposed of, he would certainly be  forced by public opinion to accept it, and provide for its upbringing.  Suso, writhing as he was under the contempt of the whole  neighbourhood, the apparent ruin of his career—knowing, too,  that this slander of one of their leaders must gravely injure the  reputation of the Friends of God—was able to meet the temptation  with a noble expression of trust. “I have confidence in the God  of Heaven, Who is rich, and Who has given me until now all that which  was needful unto me. He will help me to keep, if need be, another  beside myself.” And then he said to his temptress, “Go,  fetch the little child that I may see it.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p145"></a>“And when he had the baby, he put it on his  knees and looked at it: and the baby began to smile at him. And  sighing deeply, he said, ‘Could I kill a pretty baby that smiled  at me? No, no, I had rather suffer every trial that could come upon  me!” And turning his face to the unfortunate little creature, he  said to it, ‘Oh my poor, poor little one! Thou art but an  unhappy orphan, for thy unnatural father hath denied thee, thy wicked  mother would cast thee off, as one casts off a little dog that has  ceased to please! The providence of God hath given thee to me, in  order that I may be thy father. I wilt accept thee, then, from Him and  from none else. Ah, dear child of my heart, thou liest on my knees;  thou dost gaze at me, thou canst not yet speak! As for me, I  contemplate <a name="page_411"><font size="1" color="green">p. 411</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_411"></a> thee with a broken heart; with weeping  eyes, and lips that kiss, I bedew thy little face with my burning  tears! . . . Thou shalt be my son, and the child of the good God; and  as long as heaven gives me a mouthful, I shall share it with thee, for  the greater glory of God; and will patiently support all the trials  that may come to me, my darling son!’” How different is  this from the early Suso; interested in little but his own safe  spirituality, and with more than a touch of the religious  aesthete!</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p146"></a>The story goes on: “And when the hard-hearted  woman who had wished to kill the little one saw these tears, when she  heard these tender words, she was greatly moved: and her heart was  filled with pity, and she too began to weep and cry aloud. The  Servitor was obliged to calm her, for fear that, attracted by the  noise, some one should come and see what was going on. And when she  had finished weeping the Brother gave her back the baby and blessed  it, and said to it, ‘Now may God in His goodness bless thee, and  may the saints protect thee against all evil that may be!’ And  he enjoined the woman to care for it well at his expense.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p147"></a>Small wonder that after this heroic act of charity  Suso’s reputation went from bad to worse; that even his dearest  friends forsook him, and he narrowly escaped expulsion from the  religious life. His torments and miseries, his fears for the future,  continued to grow until they at last came to their term in a sort of  mental crisis. “His feeble nature broken by the pains which he  had to endure, he went forth raving like one who has lost his sense  and hid himself in a place far from men, where none could see or hear  him . . . and whilst he suffered thus, several times something which  came from God said within his soul, ‘Where then is your  resignation? Where is that equal humour in joy and in tribulation  which you have so lightly taught other men to love? In what manner is  it, then, that one should rest in God and have confidence only in  Him?’ He replied weeping, ‘You ask where is my  resignation? But tell me first, where is the infinite pity of God for  His friends? . . . Oh Fathomless Abyss! come to my help, for without  Thee I am lost. Thou knowest that Thou art my only consolation, that  all my trust is only in Thee. Oh hear me, for the love of God, all you  whose hearts are wounded! Behold! let none be scandalized by my insane  behaviour. So long as it was only a question of preaching resignation,  that was easy: but now that my heart is pierced, now that I am wounded  to the marrow . . . how can I be resigned?’ And after thus  suffering half a day, his brain was exhausted, and at last he became  calmer, and sitting down he came to himself: and turning to God, and  abandoning himself to His Will, he said, ‘If it cannot be  otherwise, <a name="an_iv.ix-p147.1"></a>   <i>fiat</i>    <a name="page_412"><font size="1" color="green">p. 412</font></a> <a name="an_iv.ix-Page_412"></a>   <i>voluntas tua</i>     <i>.’”</i>      <a name="an_iv.ix-p147.3"></a>    <i>     <a name="an_iv.ix-p147.4"></a>             <a name="an_iv.ix-p147.5"></a>        <b>         <a name="an_iv.ix-p147.6"></a>[840]        </b>                      </i>        The act of submission was at once followed by an ecstasy and vision,  in which the approaching end of his troubles was announced to him.  “And in the event, God came to the help of the Servitor, and  little by little that terrible tempest died away.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p148"></a>Thus with Suso, as with St. Catherine of Siena and  other mystics whom we have considered, the travail of the Dark Night  is all directed towards the essential mystic act of utter  self-surrender; that <a name="an_iv.ix-p148.1"></a>   <i>fiat voluntas tua</i>     which marks the death of selfhood in the interests  of a new and deeper life. He has learned the lesson of “the  school of true resignation”: has moved to a new stage of  reality: a complete self-naughting, an utter acquiescence in the large  and hidden purposes of the Divine Will.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.ix-p148.2"></a> “Anzi è formale ad esto beato   <i>esse</i>  <br>   tenersi dentro alla divina voglia<br>   per ch’ una fansi nostre voglie stesse,”   <a name="fr_839"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">840</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p150"></a>says Piccarda, announcing the primary law of  Paradise. Suso has passed through the fire to the state in which he  too can say,  <i>“La sua voluntate è nostre pace.”</i>  The old grouping of his consciousness round  “spiritual self” has come to its head and at last broken  down. In the midst of a psychic storm parallel to the upheavals of  conversion, “mercenary love” is for ever disestablished,  the new state of Pure Love is abruptly established in its place. Human  pain is the price: the infinite joy peculiar to “free  souls” is the reward. We may study the pain, but the nature of  the joy is beyond us: as, in the Absolute Type of all mystic  achievement, we see the cross clearly but can hardly guess at the true  nature of the resurrection life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.ix-p151"></a>Hence Suso’s description of his establishment in  the Unitive Way seems meagre, an anti-climax, after all that went  before. “And later,” he says simply, “when God  judged that it was time, He rewarded the poor martyr for all his  suffering. And he enjoyed peace of heart, and received in tranquillity  and quietness many precious graces. And he praised the Lord from the  very depths of his soul, and thanked Him for those same sufferings:  which, for all the world, he would not now have been spared. And God  caused him to understand that by this complete abasement he had gained  more, and was made the more worthy to be raised up to God, than by all  the pains which he had suffered from his youth up to that time.”   <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">841</font></a>
