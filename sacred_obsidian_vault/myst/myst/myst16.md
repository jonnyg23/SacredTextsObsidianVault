 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p1"></a>We<a name="an_iv.v-p1.1"></a> now come to that eternal battle-ground, the detailed discussion of  those abnormal psychic phenomena which appear so persistently in the  history of the mystics. That is to say, visions, auditions, automatic  script, and those dramatic dialogues between the Self and some other  factor—the Soul, Love, Reason, of the Voice of God—which  seem sometimes to arise from an exalted and uncontrolled imaginative  power, sometimes to attain the proportions of auditory  hallucination.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p2"></a>Here, moderate persons are like to be hewn in pieces  between the two “great powers” who have long disputed this  territory. On the one hand we have the strangely named rationalists,  who feel that they have settled the matter once for all by calling  attention to the obvious parallels which exist between the bodily  symptoms of acute spiritual stress and the bodily symptoms of certain  forms of disease. These considerations, reinforced by those  comfortable words “auto-suggestion” “psychosensorial  hallucination” and “association  neurosis”—which do but reintroduce mystery in another and  less attractive form—enable them to pity rather than blame the  peculiarities of the great contemplatives. French psychology, in  particular, revels in this sort of thing: and <a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="green">p. 267</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_267"></a> would, if it had its way, fill the wards of  the Salpêtriére with patients from the Roman Calendar. The  modern interpreter, says Rufus Jones, finds in the stigmata of St.  Francis of Assisi a point of weakness rather than a point of strength:  not “the marks of a saint,” but “the marks of  emotional and physical abnormality.”   <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">558</font></a>
     This is a very moderate statement of the “rational”  position, by a writer who is in actual sympathy with certain aspects  of mysticism. Yet it may well be doubted whether that flame of living  love which could, for one dazzling instant, weld body and soul in one,  was really a point of weakness in a saint: whether Blake was quite as  mad as some of his interpreters, or the powers of St. Paul and St.  Teresa are fully explained on a basis of epilepsy or hysteria:  whether, finally, it is as scientific as it looks, to lump together  all visions and voices—from Wandering Willy to the Apocalypse of  St. John—as examples of unhealthy cerebral activity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p4"></a>As against all this, the intransigeant votaries of the  supernatural seem determined to play into the hands of their foes.  They pin themselves, for no apparent reason, to the objective reality  and absolute value of visions, voices, and other experiences which  would be classed, in any other department of life, as the harmless  results of a vivid imagination: and claim as examples of miraculous  interference with “natural law” psychic phenomena which  may well be the normal if rare methods by which a certain type of  intuitive genius actualizes its perceptions of the spiritual world.   <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">559</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p6"></a>Materialistic piety of this kind, which would have us  believe that St. Anthony of Padua really held the Infant Christ in his  arms, and that the Holy Ghost truly told the Blessed Angela of Foligno  that He loved her better than any other woman in the Vale of Spoleto,  and she knew Him more intimately than the Apostles themselves,   <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">560</font></a>
     is the best friend the “rationalists” possess. It turns  dreams into miracles and drags down the symbolic visions of genius to  the level of pious hallucination. Even the profound and beautiful  significance of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque’s vision of the  Sacred Heart—a pictured expression of one of the deepest  intuitions of the human soul, caught up to the contemplation of  God’s love—has been impaired by the grossly material  interpretation which it has been forced to bear. So, too, the  beautiful reveries of Suso, the divine visitations experienced by  Francis, Catherine, <a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="green">p. 268</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_268"></a> Teresa and  countless other saints, have been degraded in the course of their  supposed elevation to the sphere called  “supernatural”—a process as fatal to their truth and  beauty as the stuffing of birds.   <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">561</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p9"></a>All this, too, is done in defiance of the great  mystics themselves, who are unanimous in warning their disciples  against the danger of attributing too much importance to  “visions” and “voices,” or accepting them at  their face value as messages from God. Nevertheless, these visions and  voices are such frequent accompaniments of the mystic life, that they  cannot be ignored. The messengers of the invisible world knock  persistently at the doors of the senses: and not only at those which  we refer to hearing and to sight. In other words, supersensual  intuitions—the contact between man’s finite being and the  Infinite Being in which it is immersed—can express themselves by  means of almost any kind of sensory automatism. Strange sweet perfumes  and tastes, physical sensations of touch, inward fires, are reported  over and over again in connection with such spiritual adventures.   <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">562</font></a>
     Those symbols under which the mystic tends to approach the Absolute  easily become objectivized, and present themselves to the  consciousness as parts of experience, rather than as modes of  interpretation. The knowledge which is obtained in such an approach is  wholly transcendental. It consists in an undifferentiated act of the  whole consciousness, in which under the spur of love life draws near  to Life. Thought, feeling, vision, touch—all are hopelessly  inadequate to it: yet all, perhaps, may hint at that intense  perception of which they are the scattered parts. “And we shall  endlessly be all had in God,” says Julian of this supreme  experience, “Him verily seeing and fully feeling, Him  spiritually hearing and Him delectably smelling and sweetly  swallowing.”   <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">563</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p12"></a>All those so-called “hallucinations of the  senses” which appear in the history of mysticism must, then, be  considered soberly, frankly, and without prejudice in the course of  our inquiry into the psychology of man’s quest of the Real. The  question for their critics must really be this: do these automatisms,  which appear so persistently as a part of the contemplative life,  represent merely <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_269"></a> the dreams and  fancies, the old digested percepts of the visionary, objectivized and  presented to his surface-mind in a concrete form; or, are they ever  representations—symbolic, if you like—of some fact, force,  or personality, some “triumphing spiritual power,”  external to himself? Is the vision only a pictured thought, an  activity of the dream imagination: or, is it the violent effort of the  self to translate something impressed upon its deeper being, some  message received from without,   <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">564</font></a>
     which projects this sharp image and places it before the  consciousness?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p14"></a>The answer seems to be that the voice or vision may be  either of these two things: and that pathology and religion have both  been over-hasty in their eagerness to snatch at these phenomena for  their own purposes. Many—perhaps most—voices do but give  the answer which the subject has already suggested to itself;   <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">565</font></a>
    many—perhaps most—visions are the picturings of dreams and  desires.   <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">566</font></a>
     Some are morbid hallucinations: some even symptoms of insanity. All  probably borrow their shape, as apart from their content, from  suggestions already present in the mind of the seer.   <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">567</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p18"></a>But there are some, experienced by minds of great  power and richness, which are crucial for those who have them. These  bring wisdom to the simple and ignorant, sudden calm to those who were  tormented by doubts. They flood the personality with new light:  accompany conversion, or the passage from one spiritual state to  another: arrive at moments of indecision, bringing with them  authoritative commands or counsels, opposed to the inclination of the  self: confer a convinced knowledge of some department of the spiritual  life before unknown. Such visions, it is clear, belong to another and  higher plane of experience from the radiant appearances of our Lady,  the piteous exhibitions of the sufferings of Christ, which swarm in  the lives of the saints, and contain no feature which is not traceable  to the subject’s religious enthusiasms or previous knowledge.   <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">568</font></a>
     These, in the apt phrase of Godfernaux, <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_270"></a> are but “images floating on the moving  deeps of feeling,”   <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">569</font></a>
     not symbolic messages from another plane of consciousness. Some test,  then, must be applied, some basis of classification discovered, if we  are to distinguish the visions and voices which seem to be symptoms of  real transcendental activity from those which are only due to  imagination raised to the   <i>n</i>   th power, to intense reverie, or to psychic illness. That test, I  think, must be the same as that which we shall find useful for  ecstatic states; namely, their life-enhancing quality.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p21"></a>Those visions and voices which are the   <i>media</i>    by which the “seeing self” truly approaches the Absolute;  which are the formula under which ontological perceptions are  expressed; are found by that self to be sources of helpful energy,  charity, and, courage. They infuse something new in the way of  strength, knowledge, direction; and leave it—physically,  mentally, or spiritually—better than they found it. Those which  do not owe their inception to the contact of the soul with external  reality—in theological language, do not “come from  God”—do not have this effect. At best, they are but the  results of the self’s turning over of her treasures: at worst,  they are the dreams—sometimes the diseased dreams—of an  active, rich, but imperfectly controlled subliminal consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p22"></a>Since it is implicit in the make-up of the mystical  temperament, that the subliminal consciousness should be active and  rich—and since the unstable nervous organization which goes with  it renders it liable to illness and exhaustion—it is not  surprising to find that the visionary experience even of the greatest  mystics is mixed in type. Once automatism has established itself in a  person, it may as easily become the expression of folly as of wisdom.  In the moments when inspiration has ebbed, old forgotten superstitions  may take its place. When Julian of Norwich in her illness saw the  “horrible showing” of the Fiend, red with black freckles,  which clutched at her throat with its paws:   <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">570</font></a>
     when St. Teresa was visited by Satan, who left a smell of brimstone  behind, or when she saw him sitting on the top of her breviary and  dislodged him by the use of holy water:   <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">571</font></a>
     it is surely reasonable to allow that we are in the presence of  visions which tend towards the psychopathic type, and which are  expressive of little else but an exhaustion and temporary loss of  balance on the subject’s part, which allowed her intense  consciousness of the reality of evil to assume a concrete form.   <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">572</font></a>
     <a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="green">p. 271</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_271"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p26"></a>Because we allow this, however, it does not follow  that all the visionary experience of such a subject is morbid: any  more than “Oedipus Tyrannus” invalidates “Prometheus  Unbound,” or occasional attacks of dyspepsia invalidate the  whole process of nutrition. The perceptive power and creative genius  of mystics, as of other great artists, sometimes goes astray. That  visions or voices should sometimes be the means by which the soul  consciously assimilates the nourishment it needs, is conceivable: it  is surely also conceivable that by the same means it may present to  the surface-intelligence things which are productive of unhealthy  rather than of healthy reactions.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p27"></a>If we would cease, once for all, to regard visions and  voices as objective, and be content to see in them forms of symbolic  expression, ways in which the subconscious activity of the spiritual  self reaches the surface-mind, many of the disharmonies noticeable in  visionary experience, which have teased the devout, and delighted the  agnostic, would fade away. Visionary experience is—or at least  may be—the outward sign of a real experience. It is a picture  which the mind constructs, it is true, from raw materials already at  its disposal: as the artist constructs his picture with canvas and  paint. But, as the artist’s paint and canvas picture is the  fruit, not merely of contact between brush and canvas, but also of a  more vital contact between his creative genius and visible beauty or  truth; so too we may see in vision, where the subject is a mystic, the  fruit of a more mysterious contact between the visionary and a  transcendental beauty or truth. Such a vision, that is to say, is the  “accident” which represents and enshrines a  “substance” unseen: the paint and canvas picture which  tries to show the surface consciousness that ineffable sight, that  ecstatic perception of good or evil—for neither extreme has the  monopoly—to which the deeper, more real soul has attained. The  transcendental powers take for this purpose such material as they can  find amongst the hoarded beliefs and memories of the self.   <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">573</font></a>
     Hence Plotinus sees the Celestial Venus, Suso the Eternal Wisdom, St.  Teresa the <a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_272"></a> Humanity of Christ, Blake  the strange personages of his prophetic books: others more obviously  symbolic objects. St. Ignatius Loyola, for instance, in a moment of  lucidity, “saw the most Holy Trinity as it were under the  likeness of a triple plectrum or of three spinet keys” and on  another occasion “the Blessed Virgin without distinction of  members.”   <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">574</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p30"></a>Visions and voices, then, may stand in the same  relation to the mystic as pictures, poems, and musical compositions  stand to the great painter, poet, musician. They are the artistic  expressions and creative results (  <i>a</i>   ) of thought, (  <i>b</i>   ) of intuition, (  <i>c</i>   ) of direct perception. All would be ready to acknowledge how  conventional and imperfect of necessity are those transcripts of  perceived Goodness, Truth, and Beauty which we owe to artistic genius:  how unequal is their relation to reality. But this is not to say that  they are valueless or absurd. So too with the mystic, whose  proceedings in this respect are closer to those of the artist than is  generally acknowledged. In both types there is a constant and  involuntary work of translation going on, by which Reality is  interpreted in the terms of appearance. In both, a peculiar mental  make-up conduces to this result.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p31"></a>In artistic subjects, the state of reverie tends  easily to a visionary character: thought becomes pictorial, auditory  or rhythmic as the case may be. Concrete images, balanced harmonies,  elusive yet recognizable, surge up mysteriously without the  intervention of the will, and place themselves before the mind. Thus  the painter really sees his impainted picture, the novelist hears the  conversation of his characters, the poet receives his cadences  ready-made, the musician listens to a veritable music which  “pipes to the spirit ditties of no tone.” In the mystic,  the same type of activity constantly appears. Profound meditation  takes a pictorial or dramatic form. Apt symbols which suggest  themselves to his imagination become objectivized. The message that he  longs for is heard within his mind. Hence, those “interior  voices” and “imaginary visions” which are  sometimes—as in Suso—indistinguishable from the ordinary  accompaniments of intense artistic activity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p32"></a>Where, however, artistic “automatisms”  spend themselves upon the artist’s work, mystical  “automatisms” in their highest forms have to do with that  transformation of personality which is the essence of the mystic life.  They are   <i>media</i>    by which the self receives spiritual stimulus; is reproved, consoled,  encouraged and guided on its upward way. Moreover, they are frequently  coordinated. The voice and the vision go together: corroborate one  another, and “work out right” in relation to the life of  the self. <a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="green">p. 273</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_273"></a> Thus St. Catherine of  Siena’s “mystic marriage” was preceded by a voice,  which ever said in answer to her prayers, “I will espouse thee  to Myself in faith”; and the vision in which that union was  consummated was again initiated by a voice saying, “I will   <i>this day</i>    celebrate solemnly with thee the feast of the betrothal of thy soul,  and even as I promised I will espouse thee to Myself in faith.”   <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">575</font></a>
     “Such automatisms as these,” says Delacroix, “are  by no means scattered and incoherent. They are systematic and  progressive: they are governed by an interior aim; they have, above  all, a teleological character. They indicate the continuous  intervention of a being at once wiser and more powerful than the  ordinary character and reason; they are the realization, in visual and  auditory images, of a secret and permanent personality of a superior  type to the conscious personality. They are its voice, the exterior  projection of its life. They translate to the conscious personality  the suggestions of the subconscious: and they permit the continuous  penetration of the conscious personality by these deeper activities.  They establish a communication between these two planes of existence,  and, by their imperative nature, they tend to make the inferior  subordinate to the superior.”   <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">576</font></a>
  </p>   <h4 align="center"><a name="an_iv.v-p34.1"></a>Audition</h4>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p35"></a>The simplest and as a rule the first way in which  automatism shows itself, is in “voices” or auditions. The  mystic becomes aware of Something which speaks to him either clearly  or implicitly; giving him abrupt and unexpected orders and  encouragements. The reality of his contact with the Divine Life is  thus brought home to him by a device with which the accidents of human  intercourse have made him familiar. His subliminal mind, open as it  now is to transcendental impressions, “at one with the  Absolute,” irradiated by the Uncreated Light, but still  dissociated from the surface intelligence which it is slowly  educating, seems to that surface self like another being. Hence its  messages are often heard, literally, as Voices: either (1) the  “immediate” or inarticulate voice, which the auditive  mystic knows so well, but finds it so difficult to define; (2) the  distinct interior voice, perfectly articulate, but recognized as  speaking only within the mind; (3) by a hallucination which we have  all experienced in dream or reverie, the exterior voice, which appears  to be speaking externally to the subject and to be heard by the  outward ear. This, the traditional classification of auditions, also  answers exactly to she three main types of vision—(1)  intellectual, (2) imaginary, (3) corporeal. <a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="green">p. 274</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_274"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p36"></a>Of these three kinds of voices the mystics are  unanimous in their opinion that the first and least  “marvellous” is by far the best: belonging indeed to an  entirely different plane of consciousness from the uttered interior or  exterior “word,” which few of the great contemplatives are  willing to accept without scrutiny as a “message from  God.” The articulate word is inevitably subject to some degree  of illusion, even at the best; since so far as it possesses  transcendental content it represents the translation of the  simultaneous into successive speech.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p37"></a>“Let Thy good Spirit enter my heart and there be  heard without utterance, and without the sound of words speak all  truth,” says a prayer attributed to St. Ambrose,   <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">577</font></a>
     exactly describing the function of these unmediated or  “intellectual words.” Dynamic messages of this kind,  imperative intuitions which elude the containing formula of speech,  are invariably attributed by the self to the direct action of the  Divine. They are indeed their own guarantee, bringing with them an  infusion of new knowledge or new life. Their character is less that of  messages than of actual “invasions” from beyond the  threshold; transcending succession and conveying “all at  once” fresh truth or certitude. “Intellectual  words,” in fact, are a form of inspiration. Eternal truth bursts  in upon the temporally-conditioned human mind. Thus St. Hildegarde  tells us that each of her great revelations was received “in an  instant” and St. Bridget of Sweden that the whole substance of  her 5th Book was given “in a flash.”   <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">578</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p40"></a>“Distinct interior words,” on the other  hand, lack this character of simultaneity. Nor are they invariably  authoritative for those who hear them. St. Teresa, whose brilliant  self-criticisms are our best source of information on mystical  auditions, considers that, though they often “come from  God,” they are not due to direct contact with the Divine; and  agrees with all the great mystics on the need of subjecting them to  criticism. She hesitated long before obeying the Voice which told her  to leave the Convent of the Incarnation and make the first foundation  of her Reform. Genuine locutions may however be distinguished from  those “words” which result merely from voluntary activity  of the imagination, as much by the sense of certitude, peace and  interior joy which they produce, as by the fact that they force  themselves upon the attention in spite of its resistance, and bring  with them knowledge which was not previously within the field of  consciousness. That is to say, they are really automatic presentations  of the result of mystic intuition, not mere rearrangements of the  constituents <a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="green">p. 275</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_275"></a> of thought.   <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">579</font></a>
     Hence they bring to the surface-self new conviction or material: have  a positive value for life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p42"></a>Those purely self-created locutions, or rearrangements  of thought “which the mind self-recollected forms and fashions  within itself”—often difficult to distinguish from true  automatic audition—are called by Philip of the trinity, St. John  of the Cross and other mystical theologians “successive  words.” They feel it to be of the highest importance that the  contemplative should learn to distinguish such hallucinations from  real transcendental perceptions presented in auditive form.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p43"></a>“I am really terrified,” says St. John of  the Cross, with his customary blunt common sense, “by what  passes among us in these days. Anyone who has barely begun to  meditate, if he becomes conscious of words of this kind during his  self-recollection, pronounces them forthwith to be the work of God;   <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">580</font></a>
     and, convinced that they are so, goes about proclaiming ‘God  has told me this,’ or ‘I have had that answer from  God.’ But all is illusion and fancy; such an one has only been  speaking to himself. Besides, the desire for these words, and the  attention they give to them, end by persuading men that all the  observations which they address to themselves are the responses of  God.”   <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">581</font></a>
     These are the words of one who was at once the sanest of saints and  the most penetrating of psychologists: words which our modern unruly  amateurs of the “subconscious” might well take to  heart.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p46"></a>True auditions are usually heard when the mind is in a  state of deep absorption without conscious thought: that is to say, at  the most favourable of all moments for contact with the transcendental  world. They translate into articulate language some aspect of that  ineffable apprehension of Reality which the contemplative enjoys:  crystallize those clairvoyant intuitions, those prophetic hints which  surge in on him so soon as he lays himself open to the influence of  the supra-sensible. Sometimes, however, mystical intuition takes the  form of a sudden and ungovernable uprush of knowledge from the deeps  of personality. Then, auditions may break in upon the normal  activities of the self with startling abruptness. It is in such cases  that their objective and uncontrollable character is most sharply  felt. However they may appear, they are, says St. Teresa, “very  distinctly formed; but by the bodily ear they are not heard. They are,  however, much more clearly understood than if they were heard by the  ear. It is impossible not to understand them, whatever resistance we  may offer. . . . The words formed by the understanding effect nothing,  but when our Lord speaks, it is   <i>at once word</i>    <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_276"></a>   <i>and work. . . .</i>    The human locution [  <i>i.e.</i>   , the work of imagination] is as something we cannot well make out, as  if we were half asleep: but the divine locution is a voice so clear,  that not a syllable of its utterance is lost. It may occur, too, when  the understanding and the soul are so troubled and distracted that  they cannot form one sentence correctly: and yet grand sentences,  perfectly arranged such as the soul in its most recollected state  never could have formed, are uttered: and at the first word, as I have  said, change it utterly.”   <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">582</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p48"></a>St. Teresa’s mystic life was governed by voices:  her active career as a foundress was much guided by them. They advised  her in small things as in great. Often they interfered with her plans,  ran counter to her personal judgment, forbade a foundation on which  she was set, or commanded one which appeared imprudent or impossible.  They concerned themselves with journeys, with the purchase of houses;  they warned her of coming events.   <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">583</font></a>
     As her mystical life matured, Teresa seems to have learned to  discriminate those locutions on which action should properly be based.  She seldom resisted them, though it constantly happened that the  action on which they insisted seemed the height of folly: and though  they frequently involved her in hardships and difficulties, she never  had cause to regret this reliance upon decrees which she regarded as  coming direct from God, and which certainly did emanate from a life  greater than her own. So too St. Hildegarde, when she prefaced her  prophecies and denunciations by “Thus saith the Living  Light” was not making use of a poetic metaphor. She lived under  the direction of a Power which was precise and articulate in its  communications, and at her peril disobeyed its commands.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p50"></a>So far from mere vague intuitions are the  “distinct interior words” which the mystic hears within  his mind, that Suso is able to state that the hundred meditations on  the Passion thus revealed to him were spoken in German and not in  Latin.   <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">584</font></a>
     St. Teresa’s own auditions were all of this interior  kind—some “distinct” and some  “substantial” or inarticulate—as her corresponding  visions were nearly all of the “intellectual” or  “imaginary” sort: that is to say, she was not subject to  sensible hallucination. Often, however, the boundary is overpassed,  and the locution seems to be heard by the mystic’s outward ear;  as in the case of those voices which guided the destinies of St. Joan  of Arc, or the Figure upon the Cross which spoke to St. Francis of  Assisi. We then have the <a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_277"></a> third  form—“exterior words”—which the mystics for  the most part regard with suspicion and dislike.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p52"></a>Sometimes audition assumes a musical rather than a  verbal character: a form of perception which probably corresponds to  the temperamental bias of the self, the ordered sweetness of Divine  Harmony striking responsive chords in the music-loving soul. The lives  of St. Francis of Assisi, St. Catherine of Siena, and Richard Rolle  provide obvious instances of this:   <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">585</font></a>
     but Suso, in whom automatism assumed its richest and most varied  forms, has also given in his autobiography some characteristic  examples.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p54"></a>“One day . . . whilst the Servitor was still at  rest, he heard within himself a gracious melody by which his heart was  greatly moved. And at the moment of the rising of the morning star, a  deep sweet voice sang within him these words, <a name="an_iv.v-p54.1"></a>   <i>Stella Maria maris, hodie processit ad ortum</i>     .    That is to say, Mary Star of the Sea is risen today. And this song  which he heard was so spiritual and so sweet, that his soul was  transported by it and he too began to sing joyously. . . . And one  day—it was in carnival time—the Servitor had continued his  prayers until the moment when the bugle of the watch announced the  dawn. Therefore he said to himself, Rest for an instant, before you  salute the shining Morning Star. And, whilst that his senses were at  rest, behold! angelic spirits began to sing the fair Respond:  <a name="an_iv.v-p54.2"></a>  <i>‘Illuminare, illuminare, Jerusalem</i>   !’And this song was echoed with a marvellous  sweetness in the deeps of his soul. And when the angels had sung for  some time his soul overflowed with joy: and his feeble body being  unable to support such happiness, burning tears escaped from his  eyes.”   <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">586</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p56"></a>Closely connected on the one hand with the phenomena  of automatic words, on the other with those of prophecy and  inspiration, is the prevalence in mystical literature of revelations  which take the form of dialogue: intimate colloquies between Divine  Reality and the Soul. The Revelations of Julian of Norwich and St.  Catherine of Siena, and many of those of the Blessed Angela of Foligno  and of the modern mystic Lucie-Christine appear to have been received  by them in this way. We seem as we read them to be present at  veritable outpourings of the Divine Mind, crystallized into verbal  form on their way through the human consciousness. We feel on the one  hand a “one-ness with the Absolute” on the part of the  mystic which has made her really, for the time being, the “voice  of God”: whilst on the other we recognize in her the persistence  of the individual—exalted, but not yet wholly absorbed <a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="green">p. 278</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_278"></a> in the Divine—whose questions, here and there, break  in upon the revelation which is mediated by the deeper mind.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p57"></a>Duologues of this sort are reported with every  appearance of realism and good faith by Suso, Tauler, Mechthild of  Magdeburg, Angela of Foligno, St. Teresa, and countless other mystics.  The third book of the “Imitation of Christ” contains some  conspicuously beautiful examples, which may or may not be due to  literary artifice. The self, wholly absorbed by the intimate sense of  divine companionship, receives its messages in the form of  “distinct interior words”; as of an alien voice, speaking  within the mind with such an accent of validity and spontaneity as to  leave no room for doubt as to its character. Often, as in  Julian’s Revelations, the discourses of the “Divine  Voice,” its replies to the eager questions of the self, are  illustrated by imaginary visions. Since these dialogues are, on the  whole, more commonly experienced in the illuminative than the unitive  way, that self—retaining a clear consciousness of its own  separateness, and recognizing the Voice as personal and distinct from  its own soul—naturally enters into a communion which has an  almost conversational character, replies to questions or asks others  in its turn: and in this dramatic style the content of its intuitions  is gradually expressed. We have then an extreme form of that  dissociation which we all experience in a slight degree when we  “argue with ourselves.” But in this case one of the  speakers is become the instrument of a power other than itself, and  communicates to the mind new wisdom and new life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p58"></a>The peculiar rhythmical language of genuine mystic  dialogue of this kind—for often enough, as in Suso’s  “Book of the Eternal Wisdom,” it is deliberately adopted  as a literary device—is an indication of its automatic  character.   <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">587</font></a>
     Expression, once it is divorced from the critical action of the  surface intelligence, always tends to assume a dithyrambic form.  Measure and colour, exaltation of language, here take a more important  place than the analytic intellect will generally permit. This feature  is easily observable in prophecy, and in automatic writing. It forms  an interesting link with poetry; which—in so far as it is  genuine and spontaneous—is largely the result of subliminal  activity. Life, which eludes language, can yet—we know not  why—be communicated by rhythm: and the mystic fact is above all  else the communication of a greater Life. Hence we must not take it  amiss if the voice of the Absolute, as translated to us by those  mystics who are alone capable of hearing it, often seems to adopt the  “grand manner.” <a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="green">p. 279</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_279"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p60"></a>We pass from the effort of man’s deeper mind to   <i>speak</i>    truth to his surface-intelligence, to the effort of the same  mysterious power to   <i>show</i>    truth: in psychological language, from auditory to visual automatism.  “Vision,” that vaguest of words, has been used by the  friends and enemies of the mystics to describe or obscure a wide range  of experience: from formless intuition, through crude optical  hallucination, to the voluntary visualizations common to the artistic  mind. In it we must include that personal and secret vision which is  the lover’s glimpse of Perfect Love, and the great pictures seen  by clairvoyant prophets acting in their capacity as eyes of the race.  Of these, the two main classes of vision, says Denis the Carthusian,  the first kind are to be concealed, the second declared. The first are  more truly mystic, the second prophetic: but excluding prophetic  vision from our inquiry, a sufficient variety of experience remains in  the purely mystical class. St. Teresa’s fluid and formless  apprehension of the Trinity, her concrete visions of Christ, Mechthild  of Madeburg’s poetic dreams, Suso’s sharply pictured  allegories, even Blake’s soul of a flea, all come under this  head.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p61"></a>Since no one can know what it is really like to have a  vision but the visionaries themselves, it will be interesting to see  what they have to say on this subject: and notice the respects in  which these self-criticisms agree with the conclusions of psychology.  We forget, whilst arguing on these matters, that it is as impossible  for those who have never heard a voice or seen a vision to discuss  these experiences with intelligence, as it is for stay-at-homes to  discuss the passions of the battle-field on the material supplied by  war correspondents. No second-hand account can truly report the  experience of the person whose perceptions or illusions present  themselves in this form. “We cannot,” says  Récéjac, “remind ourselves too often that the mystic  act consists in relations between the Absolute and Freedom which are  incommunicable. We shall never know, for instance, what was the state  of consciousness of some citizen of the antique world when he gave  himself without reserve to the inspiring suggestions of the Sacred  Fire, or some other image which evoked the infinite.”   <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">588</font></a>
     Neither shall we ever know, unless it be our good fortune to attain  to it, the secret of that consciousness which is able to apprehend the  Transcendent in visionary terms.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p63"></a>The first thing we notice when we come to this inquiry  is that the mystics are all but unanimous in their refusal to  attribute <a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="green">p. 280</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_280"></a> importance to any kind of visionary  experience.   <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">589</font></a>
     The natural timidity and stern self-criticism with which they  approach auditions is here greatly increased: and this, if taken to  heart, might well give pause to their more extreme enemies and  defenders. “If it be so,” says Hilton of automatisms in  general, “that thou see any manner of light or brightness with  thy bodily eye or in imagining, other than every man may see; or if  thou hear any merry sounding with thy ear, or in thy mouth any sweet  sudden savour, other than of kind [nature], or any heat in thy breast  as it were fire, or any manner delight in any part of thy body, or if  a spirit bodily appeareth to thee as it were an angel, for to comfort  thee and kiss thee, or any such feeling, which thou wost well that it  cometh not of thyself, nor of no bodily creature, be then wary in that  time or soon after, and wisely behold the stirrings of thy heart. If  thou be stirred because of that liking that thou feelest for to draw  out thine heart . . . from the inward desire of virtues and of ghostly  knowing and feeling of God, for to set the sight of thy heart and  thine affection, thy delight and thy rest, principally therein,  weening that bodily feeling should be a part of heavenly joy and of  angels’ bliss . . . this feeling is suspect and of the enemy.  And therefore, though it be never so liking and wonderful, refuse it,  and assent not thereto.”   <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">590</font></a>
     Nearly every master of the contemplative life has spoken to the same  effect: none, perhaps, more strongly than that stern and virile lover  of the invisible, St. John of the Cross, who was relentless in hunting  down even the most “spiritual” illusions, eager to purge  mind as well as morals of all taint of the unreal.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p66"></a>“It often happens,” he says “that  spiritual men are affected supernaturally by sensible representations  and objects. They sometimes see the forms and figures of those of  another life, saints or angels, good and evil, or certain  extraordinary lights and brightness. They hear strange words,  sometimes seeing those who utter them and sometimes not. They have a  sensible perception at times of most sweet odours, without knowing  whence they proceed. . . . Still, though all these experiences may  happen to the bodily senses in the way of God, we must never delight  in them nor encourage them; yea, rather we must fly from them, without  seeking to know whether their origin be good or evil. For, inasmuch as  they are exterior and physical, the less is the likelihood of their  being from God. That which properly and generally comes <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="green">p. 281</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_281"></a> from God is a purely spiritual communication; wherein  there is greater security and profit for the soul than through the  senses, wherein there is usually much danger and delusion, because the  bodily sense decides upon, and judges, spiritual things, thinking them  to be what itself feels them to be, when in reality they are as  different as body and soul, sensuality and reason.”   <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">591</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p68"></a>Again, “in the high state of the union of love,  God does not communicate Himself to the soul under the disguise of  imaginary visions, similitudes or figures, neither is there place for  such, but mouth to mouth. . . . The soul, therefore, that will ascend  to this perfect union with God, must be careful not to lean upon  imaginary visions, forms, figures, and particular intelligible  objects, for these things can never serve as proportionate or  proximate means towards so great an end; yea, rather they are an  obstacle in the way, and therefore to be guarded against and  rejected.”   <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">592</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p70"></a>So, too, St. Teresa. “In such matters as these  there is always cause to fear illusion; until we are assured that they  truly proceed from the Spirit of God. Therefore at the beginning it is  always best to resist them. If it is indeed God who is acting, the  soul will but progress still more quickly, for the trial will favour  her advancement.”   <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">593</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p72"></a>Vision, then, is recognized by the true contemplative  as at best an imperfect, oblique, and untrustworthy method of  apprehension: it is ungovernable, capricious, liable to deception, and  the greater its accompanying hallucination the more suspicious it  becomes. All, however, distinguish different classes of visionary  experience; and differentiate sharply between the value of the vision  which is “felt” rather than seen, and the true optical  hallucination which is perceived, exterior to the subject, by the  physical sight.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p73"></a>We may trace in visions, as in voices—for these,  from the psychologist’s point of view, are strictly parallel  phenomena—a progressive externalization on the self’s part  of those concepts or intuitions which form the bases of all automatic  states. Three main groups have been distinguished by the mystics, and  illustrated again and again from their experiences. These are (1)  Intellectual (2) Imaginary, and (3) Corporeal vision: answering to (1)  Substantial or inarticulate, (2) Interior and distinct, (3) Exterior  words. With the first two we must now concern ourselves. As to  corporeal vision, it has few peculiarities of interest to the student  of pure mysticism. Like the “exterior word” it is little  else than a more or less uncontrolled externalization of inward  memories, thoughts, or <a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="green">p. 282</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_282"></a> intuitions—even of  some pious picture which has become imprinted on the mind—which  may, in some subjects, attain the dimensions of true sensorial  hallucination.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p74"></a>(1)   <i>Intellectual Vision.—</i>   The “intellectual vision,” like the “substantial  word” as described to us by the mystics, is of so elusive,  spiritual, and formless a kind that it is hard to distinguish it from  that act of pure contemplation in which it often takes its rise. These  moods and apprehensions of the soul are so closely linked  together—the names applied to them are so often little more than  the struggles of different individuals to describe by analogy an  experience which is   <i>one—</i>   that we risk a loss of accuracy the moment that classification begins.  The intellectual vision, so far as we can understand it, seems to be a    <i>something</i>    not sought but put before the mind, and seen or perceived by the  whole self by means of a sense which is neither sight nor feeling, but  partakes of the character of both. It is intimate but indescribable:  definite, yet impossible to define. There is a passage in the  Revelations of Angela of Foligno which vividly describes the sequence  of illuminated states leading up to and including the intuitions which  constitute the substance of this “formless vision” and its  complement the “formless word”: and this does far more  towards making us realize its nature than the most painstaking  psychological analysis could ever do. “At times God comes into  the soul without being called; and He instills into her fire, love,  and sometimes sweetness; and the soul believes this comes from God,  and delights therein. But she does not yet know, or see, that He  dwells in her; she perceives His grace, in which she delights. And  again God comes to the soul, and speaks to her words full of  sweetness, in which she has much joy, and she feels Him. This   <i>feeling</i>    of God gives her the greatest delight; but even here a certain doubt  remains; for the soul has not the certitude that God is in her. . . .  And beyond this the soul receives the gift of seeing God. God says to  her, ‘Behold Me!’ and the soul sees Him dwelling within  her. She sees Him more clearly than one man sees another. For   <i>the eyes of the soul behold a plenitude of which I cannot speak: a  plenitude which is not bodily but spiritual, of which I can say  nothing.</i>    And the soul rejoices in that sight with an ineffable joy; and this  is the manifest and certain sign that God indeed dwells in her. And  the soul can behold nothing else, because this fulfils her in an  unspeakable manner. This beholding, whereby the soul can behold no  other thing, is so profound that it grieves me that I can say nothing  of it. It is not a thing which can be touched or imagined, for it is  ineffable.”   <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">594</font></a>
     <a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_283"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p76"></a>Intellectual vision, then, seems to be closely  connected with that “consciousness of the Presence of God”  which we discussed in the last chapter: though the contemplatives  themselves declare that it differs from it.   <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">595</font></a>
     It is distinguished apparently from that more or less diffused  consciousness of Divine Immanence by the fact that although unseen of  the eyes, it can be exactly located in space. The mystic’s  general awareness of the divine is here focussed upon one  point—a point to which some theological or symbolic character is  at once attached. The result is a sense of presence so concrete  defined, and sharply personal that, as St. Teresa says, it carries  more conviction than bodily sight. This invisible presence is  generally identified by Christian mystics rather with the Humanity of  Christ than with the unconditioned Absolute. “In the prayer of  union and of quiet,” says St. Teresa, “certain inflowings  of the Godhead are present; but in the   <i>vision,</i>    the Sacred Humanity also, together with them, is pleased to be our  companion and to do us good.”   <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">596</font></a>
     “A person who is in no way expecting such a favour,” she  says again, “nor has ever imagined herself worthy of receiving  it, is conscious that Jesus Christ stands by her side; although she  sees Him neither with the eyes of the body nor of the soul. This is  called an intellectual vision; I cannot tell why. This vision, unlike  an imaginary one, does not pass away quickly but lasts for several  days and even sometimes for more than a year. . . . Although I believe  some of the former favours are more sublime, yet this brings with it a  special knowledge of God; a most tender love for Him results from  being constantly in His company while the desire of devoting  one’s whole being to His service is more fervent than any  hitherto described. The conscience is greatly purified by the  knowledge of His perpetual and near presence, for although we know  that God sees all we do, yet nature inclines us to grow careless and  forgetful of it. This is impossible here, since our Lord makes the  soul conscious that He is close at hand.”   <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">597</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p80"></a>In such a state—to which the term  “vision” is barely applicable—it will be observed  that consciousness is at its highest, and hallucination at its lowest  point. Nothing is seen, even with the eyes of the mind: as, in the  parallel case of the “substantial word,” nothing is said.  It is pure apprehension: in the one case of Personality, in the other  of knowledge. “The immediate vision of the naked Godhead,”  says Suso of this, “is without doubt the pure truth: a vision is  to be esteemed the more noble the more <a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_284"></a> intellectual  it is, the more it is stripped of all image and approaches the state  of pure contemplation.”   <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">598</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p82"></a>We owe to St. Teresa our finest first-hand account of  this strange condition of “awareness.” It came upon her  abruptly, after a period of psychic distress, and seemed to her to be  an answer to her unwilling prayers that she might be “led”  by some other way than that of “interior words”; which  were, in the opinion of her director, “so suspicious.”  “I could not force myself,” she says, “to desire the  change, nor believe that I was under the influence of Satan. Though I  was doing all I could to believe the one and to desire the other, it  was not in my power to do so.” She resolved this divided state  by making an act of total surrender to the will of God: and it seems  to have been as the result of this release of stress, this willing  receptivity, that the new form of automatism suddenly developed  itself, reinforcing and justifying her auditions and bringing peace  and assurance to the distracted surface-self.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p83"></a>“At the end of two years spent in prayer by  myself and others for this end, namely, that our Lord would either  lead me by another way, or show the truth of this—for now the  locutions of our Lord were extremely frequent—this happened to  me. I was in prayer one day—it was the feast of the glorious St.  Peter—when I saw Christ close by me, or, to speak more  correctly, felt Him; for I saw nothing with the eyes of the body,  nothing with the eyes of the soul. He seemed to me to be close beside  me; and I saw, too, as I believe, that it was He who was speaking to  me. As I was utterly ignorant that such a vision was possible, I was  extremely afraid at first, and did nothing but weep; however, when He  spoke to me but one word to reassure me, I recovered myself, and was,  as usual, calm and comforted, without any fear whatever. Jesus Christ  seemed to be by my side continually. As the vision was not imaginary,  I saw no form, but I had a most distinct feeling that He was always on  my right hand, a witness of all I did; and never at any time, if I was  but slightly recollected, or not too much distracted, could I be  ignorant of His near presence. I went at once to my confessor in great  distress, to tell him of it. He asked in what form I saw our Lord. I  told him I saw no form. He then said: ‘How did you know that it  was Christ?’ I replied that I did not know how I knew it; but I  could not help knowing that He was close beside me . . . there are no  words whereby to explain—at least, none for us women, who know  so little; learned men can explain it better.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p84"></a>“For if I say that I see Him neither with the  eyes of the body nor those of the soul—because it was not an  imaginary vision—how is it that I can understand and maintain  that He stand <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="green">p. 285</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_285"></a> beside me, and be   <i>more certain of it than if I saw Him</i>   ? If it be supposed that it is as if a person were blind, or in the  dark, and therefore unable to see another who is close to him, the  comparison is not exact. There is a certain likelihood about it,  however, but not much, because the other senses tell him who is blind  of that presence: he hears the other speak or move, or he touches him;  but in these visions there is nothing like this. The darkness is not  felt; only He renders Himself present to the soul by a certain  knowledge of Himself which is more clear than the sun. I do not mean  that we now see either a sun or any other brightness, only that there  is a light not seen, which illumines the understanding, so that the  soul may have the fruition of so great a good. This vision brings with  it great blessings.”   <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">599</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p86"></a>(2) In   <i>Imaginary Vision,</i>    as in “interior words,” there is again no sensorial  hallucination. The self sees sharply and clearly, it is true: but is  perfectly aware that it does so in virtue of its most precious  organ—“that inward eye which is the bliss of  solitude.”   <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">600</font></a>
     Imaginary Vision is the spontaneous and automatic activity of a power  which all artists, all imaginative people, possess. So far as the  machinery employed in it is concerned, there is little real difference  except in degree between Wordsworth’s imaginary vision of the  “dancing daffodils” and Suso’s of the dancing  angels, who “though they leapt very high in the dance, did so  without any lack of gracefulness.”   <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">601</font></a>
     Both are admirable examples of “passive imaginary  vision”: though in the first the visionary is aware that the  picture seen is supplied by memory, whilst in the second it arises  spontaneously like a dream from the subliminal region, and contains  elements which may be attributed to love, belief, and direct intuition  of truth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p90"></a>Such passive imaginary vision—by which I mean  spontaneous mental pictures at which the self looks, but in the action  of which it does not participate—takes in the mystics two main  forms: (a) symbolic, (b) personal.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p91"></a>(a) In the symbolic form there is no mental deception:  the self is aware that it is being shown truth “under an  image.” Many of the visions of the great prophetic  mystics—e.g., St. Hildegarde—have so elaborate a symbolic  character, that much intellectual activity is involved in their  interpretation. This interpretation is <a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="green">p. 286</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_286"></a> sometimes  “given” with the vision. Rulman Merswin’s  “Vision of Nine Rocks” is thus described to us as being  seen by him in a sharp picture, the allegorical meaning of which was  simultaneously presented to his mind. In Suso’s life these  symbolic visions abound: he seems to have lived always on the verge of  such a world of imagination, and to have imbibed truth most easily in  this form. Thus: “It happened one morning that the Servitor saw  in a vision that he was surrounded by a troop of heavenly spirits. He  therefore asked one of the most radiant amongst these Princes of the  Sky to show him how God dwelt in his soul. The angel said to him,  ‘Do but fix your eyes joyously upon yourself, and watch how God  plays the game of love within your loving soul.’ And he looked  quickly, and saw that his body in the region of his heart was pure and  transparent like crystal: and he saw the Divine Wisdom peacefully  enthroned in the midst of his heart, and she was fair to look upon.  And by her side was the soul of the Servitor, full of heavenly  desires; resting lovingly upon the bosom of God, Who had embraced it,  and pressed it to His Heart. And it remained altogether absorbed and  inebriated with love in the arms of God its well-beloved.”   <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">602</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p93"></a>In such a vision as this, we see the mystic’s  passion for the Absolute, his intuition of Its presence in his soul,  combining with material supplied by a poetic imagination, and  expressing itself in an allegorical form. It is really a visualized  poem, inspired by a direct contact with truth. Of the same kind are  many of those reconstructions of Eternity in which mystics and seers  of the transcendent and outgoing type actualized their profound  apprehensions of reality. In such experiences, as Beatrice told Dante  when he saw the great vision of the River of Light, the thing seen is  the shadowy presentation of a transcendent Reality which the self is  not yet strong enough to see.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.v-p93.1"></a> “E vidi lume in forma  di rivera<br>   fulvido di fulgore, intra due rive<br>   dipinte di mirabil primavera.<br>   Di tal fiumana uscian faville vive,<br>   e d’ ogni parte si mettean nei fiori,<br>   quasi rubin che oro circonscrive.<br>   Poi, come inebriate dagli odori,<br>   riprofondavan sè nel miro gurge,<br>   e, s’una entrava, un’ altra n’  uscia fuori.”<br>   . . . .<br>   “il sol degli occhi miei<br>   anco soggiunse: Il fiume, e li topazii<br>   ch’ entrano ed escono, e il rider dell’  erbe<br>   son di lor vero ombriferi prefazii. <a name="page_287"><font size="1" color="green">p. 287</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_287"></a><br>   Non che da sè sien queste cose acerbe:<br>   ma è difetto dalla parte tua,<br>   che non hai viste ancor tanto  superbe.” <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">603</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p95"></a>In the last two lines of this wonderful passage, the  whole philosophy of vision is expressed. It is an accommodation of the  supra-sensible to our human disabilities, a symbolic reconstruction of  reality on levels accessible to sense. This symbolic reconstruction is  seen as a profoundly significant, vivid, and dramatic dream: and since  this dream conveys transcendental truth, and initiates the visionary  into the atmosphere of the Eternal, it may well claim precedence over  that prosaic and perpetual vision which we call the “real  world.” In it—as in the less significant dreams of our  common experience—vision and audition are often combined. Many  of the visions of St. Mechthild of Hackborn are of this complex type.  Thus—“She saw in the Heart of God, as it were a virgin  exceeding fair, holding a ring in her hand on which was a diamond:  with which, incessantly, she touched the Heart of God. Moreover, the  soul asked why that virgin thus touched the Heart of God. And the  virgin answered, ‘I am Divine Love, and this stone signifieth  the sin of Adam. . . . As soon as Adam sinned, I introduced myself and  intercepted the whole of his sin, and by thus ceaselessly touching the  Heart of God and moving Him to pity, I suffered Him not to rest until  the moment when I took the Son of God from His Father’s Heart  and laid him in the Virgin Mother’s womb.’ . . . Another  time, she saw how Love, under the likeness of a fair Virgin, went  round about the consistory singing   <i>Alone I have made the circuit of heaven, and I have walked on the  waves of the sea.</i>    In these words she understood how Love had subjected to herself the  Omnipotent Majesty of God, had inebriated His Unsearchable Wisdom, had  drawn forth all His most sweet goodness; and, by wholly conquering His  divine justice and changing it into gentleness and mercy, had moved  the Lord of all Majesty.”   <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">604</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p97"></a>Imaginary vision of this kind is probably far more  common than is generally supposed: and can exist without any  disturbance of that balance of faculties which is usually recognized  as “sane.” <a name="page_288"><font size="1" color="green">p. 288</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_288"></a> “If,” says  Pratt, “there be any truth in Freud’s insistence upon the  symbolic nature of normal dreams, it is the less surprising that the  dream imagination of the Christian mystic should work up visions of a  symbolic sort. . . . Our modern tendency to consider visions quite  extraordinary and pathological is probably mistaken.   <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">605</font></a>
     It is certain that the meditations of those persons who are  “good visualizers” often take a pictorial form; and indeed  St. Ignatius Loyola, the great teacher of meditation, advised a  deliberate effort so to visualize the subject dwelt upon. The picture  may appear involuntarily, at the summit of a train of thought, which  it sometimes illustrates and sometimes contradicts. It may show itself  faintly against a background of mist; or start into existence sharply  focussed, well-lighted, and alive. It always brings with it a greater  impression of reality than can be obtained by the operations of the  discursive mind.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p99"></a>(  <i>b</i>   ) The symbolic and artistic character of the visions we have been  discussing is obvious. There is, however, another form of imaginary  vision which must be touched on with a gentler hand. In this, the  imagery seized upon by the subliminal powers, or placed before the  mind by that Somewhat Other of which the mystic is always conscious  over against himself, is at once so vivid, so closely related to the  concrete beliefs and spiritual passions of the self, and so perfectly  expresses its apprehensions of God, that it is not always recognized  as symbolic in kind. A simple example of this is the vision of Christ  at the moment of consecration at Mass, experienced by so many Catholic  ecstatics.   <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">606</font></a>
     Another is St. Margaret Mary Alacoque’s vision of the Sacred  Heart. St. Teresa is one of the few mystics who have detected the true  character of automatisms of this sort: which bring with  them—like their purer forms, the intellectual visions of  God—a vivid apprehension of Personality, the conviction of a  living presence, rather than the knowledge of new facts. “Now  and then,” she says of her own imaginary visions of Christ,  “it seemed to me that what I saw was an image: but most  frequently it was not so. I thought it was Christ Himself, judging by  the brightness in which He was pleased to show Himself. Sometimes the  vision was so indistinct, that I <a name="page_289"><font size="1" color="green">p. 289</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_289"></a> thought it was an  image: but still, not like a picture, however well painted, and I have  seen a good many pictures. It would be absurd to suppose that the one  bears any resemblance whatever to the other, for they differ as a  living person differs from his portrait, which, however well drawn,  cannot be lifelike, for it is plain that it is a dead thing.”   <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">607</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p102"></a>“The vision,” she says in another place,  “passes as quickly as a flash of lightning, yet this most  glorious picture makes an impression on the imagination that I believe  can never be effaced until the soul at last sees Christ to enjoy Him  for ever. Although I call it a ‘picture,’ you must not  imagine that it looks like a painting; Christ appears as a living  Person, Who sometimes speaks and reveals deep mysteries.”   <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">608</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p104"></a>It seems, then, that this swift and dazzling vision of  Divine Personality may represent a true contact of the soul with the  Absolute Life—a contact immediately referred to the image under  which the self is accustomed to think of its God. Obviously in the  case of Christian contemplatives this image will most usually be the  historical Person of Christ, as He is represented in sacred literature  and art.   <a name="fr_608"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">609</font></a>
     The life-enhancing quality of such an abrupt apprehension, however,  the profound sense of reality which it brings, permit of its being  classed not amongst vivid dreams, but amongst those genuine mystic  states in which “the immanent God, formless, but capable of  assuming all forms, expresses Himself in vision as He had expressed  Himself in words.”   <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">610</font></a>
     Certainty and joy are the feeling-states accompanying this  experience; which is as it were a love-letter received by the ardent  soul, bringing with it the very fragrance of personality, along with  the sign-manual of the beloved.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p107"></a>This concrete vision of Christ has the true mystic  quality of ineffability, appearing to the self under a form of  inexpressible beauty, illuminated with that unearthly light which is  so persistently reported as a feature of transcendent experience. The  artist’s exalted consciousness of Beauty as a form of Truth is  here seen operating on the transcendental plane. Thus when St. Teresa  saw only the Hands of God, she was thrown into an <a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="green">p. 290</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_290"></a>  ecstasy of adoration by their shining loveliness.   <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">611</font></a>
     “If I were to spend many years in devising how to picture to  myself anything so beautiful,” she says of the imaginary vision  of Christ, “I should never be able, nor even know how, to do it;  for it is beyond the scope of any possible imagination here below: the  whiteness and brilliancy alone are inconceivable. It is not a  brightness which dazzles, but a delicate whiteness, an infused  brightness, giving excessive delight to the eyes, which are never  wearied thereby nor by the visible brightness which enables us to see  a beauty so divine. It is a light so different from any light here  below, that the very brightness of the sun we see, in comparison with  the brightness and light before our eyes, seems to be something so  obscure that no one would ever wish to open his eyes again. . . . In  short, it is such that no man, however gifted he may be, can ever in  the whole course of his life arrive at any imagination of what it is.  God puts it before us so instantaneously, that we could not open our  eyes in time to see it, if it were necessary for us to open them at  all. But whether our eyes be open or shut, it makes no difference  whatever: for when our Lord wills, we must see it, whether we will or  not.”   <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">612</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p110"></a>There is another and highly important class of visual  automatisms: those which I have chosen to call   <i>Active Imaginary Visions.</i>    Whereas vision of the passive kind is the expression of thought,  perception, or desire on the part of the deeper self: active vision is  the expression of a change in that self, and generally accompanies  some psychological crisis. In this vision, which always has a dramatic  character, the self seems to itself to act, not merely to look on.  Such visions may possess many of the characters of dreams; they may be  purely symbolic; they may be theologically “realistic.”  They may entail a journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, an  excursion into fairyland, a wrestling with the Angel in the Way.  Whatever their outward form, they are always connected with inward  results. They are the automatic expressions of intense subliminal  activity: not merely the   <i>media</i>    by which the self’s awareness of the Absolute is strengthened  and enriched, but the outward and visible signs of its movement  towards new levels of consciousness. Hence we are not surprised to  find that a dynamic vision of this sort often initiates the Unitive  Life. Such are the imaginary visions reported by St. Francis of Assisi  and St. Catherine of Siena at the moment of their stigmatization: the  <a name="page_291"><font size="1" color="green">p. 291</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_291"></a> transverberation of St. Teresa; the heavenly  visitor who announced to Suso his passage from the “lower  school” to the “upper school” of the Holy Spirit.   <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">613</font></a>
     But perhaps the most picturesque and convincing example of all such  dramas of the soul, is that which is known in art as the “Mystic  Marriage of St. Catherine of Siena.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p112"></a>We have seen that Catherine, who was subject from  childhood to imaginary visions and interior words, had long been  conscious of a voice reiterating the promise of this sacred  bretrothal; and that on the last day of the Carnival, A.D. 1366, it  said to her, “I will this day celebrate solemnly with thee the  feast of the betrothal of thy soul, and even as I promised I will  espouse thee to Myself in faith.” “Then,” says her  legend, “whilst the Lord was yet speaking, there appeared the  most glorious Virgin His Mother, the most blessed John, Evangelist,  the glorious Apostle Paul, and the most holy Dominic, father of her  order; and with these the prophet David, who had the psaltery set to  music in his hands; and while he played with most sweet melody the  Virgin Mother of God took the right hand of Catherine with her most  sacred hand, and, holding out her fingers towards the Son, besought  Him to deign to espouse her to Himself in faith. To which graciously  consenting the Only Begotten of God drew out a ring of gold, which had  in its circle four pearls enclosing a most beauteous diamond; and  placing this ring upon the ring finger of Catherine’s right hand  He said, ‘Lo, I espouse thee to Myself, thy Creator and Saviour  in the faith, which until thou dost celebrate thy eternal nuptials  with Me in Heaven thou wilt preserve ever without stain. Henceforth,  my daughter, do manfully and without hesitation those things which by  the ordering of My providence will be put into thy hands; for being  now armed with the fortitude of the faith, thou wilt happily overcome  all thy adversaries.’ Then the vision disappeared, but that ring  ever remained on her finger, not indeed to the sight of others, but  only to the sight of the virgin herself; for she often, albeit with  bashfulness, confessed to me that she always saw that ring on her  finger, nor was there any time when she did not see it.”’   <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">614</font></a>
     <a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="green">p. 292</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_292"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p114"></a>It is not difficult to discern the materials from  which this vision has been composed. As far as its outward  circumstances go, it is borrowed intact from the legendary history of  St. Catherine of Alexandria, with which her namesake must have been  familiar from babyhood.   <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">615</font></a>
     Caterina Benincasa showed a characteristic artistic suggestibility  and quickness in transforming the stuff of this old story into the  medium of a profound personal experience: as her contemporaries  amongst the Sienese painters took subject, method, and composition  from the traditional Byzantine source, yet forced them to become  expressions of their overpowering individuality. The important matter  for us, however, is not the way in which the second Catherine adapted  a traditional story to herself, actualized it in her experience: but  the fact that it was for her the sacramental form under which she  became acutely and permanently conscious of union with God. Long  prepared by that growing disposition of her deeper self which caused  her to hear the reiterated promise of her Beloved, the vision when it  came was significant, not for its outward circumstances, but for its  permanent effect upon her life. In it she passed to a fresh level of  consciousness; entering upon that state of spiritual wedlock, of close  and loving identification with the interests of Christ, which Richard  of St. Victor calls the “Third Stage of Ardent Love.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p116"></a>Of the same active sort is St. Teresa’s great  and celebrated vision, or rather experience, of the Transverberation;  in which imagery and feeling go side by side in their effort towards  expressing the anguish of insatiable love. “I saw,” she  says, “an angel close by me, on my left side, in bodily form.  This I am not accustomed to see unless very rarely. Though I have  visions of angels frequently, yet I see them only by an intellectual  vision, such as I have spoken of before. It was our Lord’s will  that in this vision I should see the angel in this wise. He was not  large, but small of stature, and most beautiful—his face  burning, as if he were one of the highest angels, who seem to be all  of fire: they must be those whom we call Cherubim. . . . I saw in his  hand a long spear of gold, and at the iron’s point there seemed  to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times  into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he  seemed to draw them out also and to leave me all on fire with a great  love of God. The pain was so great that it made me moan; and yet so  surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain that I could not  wish to be rid of it. The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than  God. The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the body has its  share in it, even a large one. It is a caressing of love so sweet  which now takes <a name="page_293"><font size="1" color="green">p. 293</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_293"></a> place between the soul and God,  that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may  think that I am lying.”   <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">616</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p118"></a>Finally it should be added that dynamic vision may  assume a purely intellectual form; as in the case of the Blessed  Angela of Foligno. “During last Lent I found myself,” she  says, “altogether in God, without knowing how, and in a way more  exalted than was customary for me. I seemed to be in the midst of the  Trinity in a more exalted way than I had ever been before for greater  than usual were the blessings I received, and I enjoyed these  blessings without interruption. And thus to be absorbed in God filled  me with joy and with delight. And feeling myself to be in this  beatitude and this great and unspeakable delight, which were above all  I had experienced before, such ineffable divine operations took place  in my soul, as neither saint nor angel could describe or explain. And  I see and understand that these divine operations, that unfathomable  abyss, no angel or other creature howsoever great or wise, could  comprehend; and all I say now of it seemeth to me so ill said that it  is blasphemy.”   <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">617</font></a>
  </p>   <h4 align="center"><a name="an_iv.v-p119.1"></a>Automatic Script</h4>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p120"></a>The rarest of the automatic activities reported to us  in connection with mysticism is that of “automatic  writing.” This form of subliminal action has already been spoken  of in an earlier chapter;   <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">618</font></a>
     where two of the most marked examples—Blake and Madame  Guyon—are discussed. As with voice and vision, so this power of  automatic composition may and does exist in various degrees of  intensity: ranging from that “inspiration,” that  irresistible impulse to write, of which all artists are aware, to the  extreme form in which the hand of the conscious self seems to have  become the agent of another personality. We are not here in the  presence of phenomena which require a “supernatural”  explanation. From the point of view of the psychologist, the  inspirational writing of the mystics differs in degree rather than in  kind from such poetic creation as that described by de Russet:  “it is not work, it is listening; it is as if some unknown  person were speaking in your ear.”   <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">619</font></a>
     Such subliminal activity is probably present to some extent in all  the literary work of the great mystics, whose creative power, like  that of most poets, is largely dissociated from the control of the  will and the surface intelligence.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p123"></a>St. Catherine of Siena, we are told, dictated her  great Dialogue to her secretaries whilst in the state of ecstasy:  which may mean <a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="green">p. 294</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_294"></a> no more than the absorbed state of  recollection in which the creative faculty works most freely, or may  have been a condition of consciousness resembling the  “trance” of mediums, in which the deeper mind governs the  tongue. Had she been more accustomed to the use of the pen—she  did not learn writing until after the beginning of her apostolic  life—that deeper mind would almost certainly have expressed  itself by means of automatic script. As it is, in the rhythm and  exaltation of its periods, the Dialogue bears upon it all the marks of  true automatic composition of the highest type. The very  discursiveness of its style, its loose employment of metaphor, the  strangely mingled intimacy and remoteness of its tone, link it with  prophetic literature; and are entirely characteristic of subliminal  energy of a rich type, dissociated from the criticism and control of  the normal consciousness.    <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_619"><font size="1">620</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p125"></a>So too the writings of Rulman Merswin, if we accept  the ingenious and interesting theory of his psychic state elaborated  by M. Jundt,   <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_620"><font size="1">621</font></a>
     were almost wholly of this kind. So Blake insisted that he was  “under the direction of Messengers from Heaven, Daily and  Nightly,”   <a name="fr_621"></a><a href="#fn_621"><font size="1">622</font></a>
     and stated on his deathbed that the credit for all his works belonged  not to himself, but to his “celestial friends,”   <a name="fr_622"></a><a href="#fn_622"><font size="1">623</font></a>
       <i>i.e.</i>   , to the inspiration of a personality which had access to levels of  truth and beauty unknown to his surface mind.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p129"></a>St. Teresa was of much the same opinion in respect of  her great mystical works: which were, she said, like the speech of a  parrot repeating, though he cannot understand, the things which his  master has taught him. There is little doubt that her powers of  composition—as we might expect in one so apt at voice and  vision—were largely of the uncontrolled, inspired, or  “automatic” kind. She wrote most usually after the  reception of Holy Communion—that is to say, when her mystic  consciousness was in its most active state—and always swiftly,  without hesitations or amendments. Ideas and images welled up from her  rich and active subliminal region too quickly, indeed, for her eager,  hurrying pen: so that she sometimes exclaimed, “Oh, that I could  write with many hands, so that none were forgotten!”   <a name="fr_623"></a><a href="#fn_623"><font size="1">624</font></a>
     In Teresa’s unitive state, a slight suggestion was enough to  change the condition of her consciousness, place her under the  complete domination of her deeper mind. Often, she said, when  composing the “Interior Castle,” her work reacted upon  herself. She would suddenly be caught up into the very degree of  contemplation <a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="green">p. 295</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_295"></a> which she was trying to describe, and  continued to write in this absorbed or entranced condition, clearly  perceiving that her pen was guided by a power not her own, and  expressed ideas unknown to her surface mind, which filled her with  astonishment.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p131"></a>In the evidence given during the process for St.  Teresa’s beatification, Maria de San Francisco of Medina, one of  her early nuns, stated that on entering the saint’s cell whilst  she was writing this same “Interior Castle” she found her  so absorbed in contemplation as to be unaware of the external world.  “If we made a noise close to her,” said another, Maria del  Nacimiento, “she neither ceased to write nor complained of being  disturbed.” Both these nuns, and also Ana de la Encarnacion,  prioress of Granada, affirmed that she wrote with immense speed, never  stopping to erase or to correct: being anxious, as she said, to  “write what the Lord had given her, before she forgot it.”  They and many others declared that when she was thus writing she  seemed like another being: and that her face, excessively beautiful in  expression, shone with an unearthly splendour which afterwards faded  away.   <a name="fr_624"></a><a href="#fn_624"><font size="1">625</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p133"></a>As for Madame Guyon, whose temperament had in it  almost as much of the medium as of the mystic, and whose passion for  quietism and mental passivity left her almost wholly at the mercy of  subconscious impulses, she exhibits by turns the phenomena of  clairvoyance, prophecy, telephathy, and automatic writing, in  bewildering profusion.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p134"></a>“I was myself surprised,” she says,  “at the letters which Thou didst cause me to write, and in which  I had no part save the actual movement of my hand: and it was at this  time that I received that gift of writing according to the interior  mind, and not according to my own mind, which I had never known  before. Also my manner of writing was altogether changed, and every  one was astonished because I wrote with such great facility.”   <a name="fr_625"></a><a href="#fn_625"><font size="1">626</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p136"></a>Again, “. . . Thou didst make me write with so  great a detachment that I was obliged to leave off and begin again as  Thou didst choose. Thou didst try me in every way: suddenly Thou  wouldst cause me to write, then at once to cease, and then to begin  again. When I wrote during the day, I would be suddenly interrupted,  and often left words half written, and afterwards Thou wouldst give me  whatever was pleasing to Thee. Nothing of that which I wrote was in my  mind: my mind, in fact, was so wholly at liberty that it seemed a  blank, I was so detached from that which I wrote that it seemed  foreign to me. . . . All the faults in my writings come from this:  that being unaccustomed to the operations of God, I was <a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="green">p. 296</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_296"></a> often unfaithful to them, thinking that I did well to  continue writing when I had time, without being moved thereto, because  I had been told to finish the work. So that it is easy to distinguish  the parts which are fine and sustained, and those which have neither  savour nor grace. I have left them as they are; so that the difference  between the Spirit of God and the human or natural spirit may be seen.  . . . I continued always to write, and with an inconceivable  swiftness, for the hand could hardly keep up with the dictating  spirit: and during this long work, I never changed my method, nor did  I make use of any book. The scribe could not, however great his  diligence, copy in five days that which I wrote in a single night. . .  . I will add to all that I have been saying on my writings, that a  considerable part of the book on ‘Judges’ was lost. Being  asked to complete it, I rewrote the lost portions. Long afterwards,  when I was moving house, these were found in a place where no one  could have imagined that they would be; and the old and new versions  were exactly alike—a circumstance which greatly astonished those  persons of learning and merit who undertook its verification.”   <a name="fr_626"></a><a href="#fn_626"><font size="1">627</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p138"></a>A far greater and stronger mystic than Madame Guyon,  Jacob Boehme, was also in his literary composition the more or less  helpless tool of some power other than his normal surface-mind. It is  clear from his own words that his first book, the  “Aurora,” produced after the great illumination which he  received in the year 1610, was no deliberate composition, but an  example of inspired or automatic script. This strange work, full of  sayings of a deep yet dazzling darkness, was condemned by the local  tribunal; and Boehme was forbidden to write more. For seven years he  obeyed. Then “a new motion from on high” seized him, and  under the pressure of this subliminal impulse—which,  characteristically, he feels as coming from without not from  within—he began to write again.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p139"></a>This second outburst of composition, too, was almost  purely automatic in type. The transcendental consciousness was in  command, and Boehme’s surface-intellect could exert but little  control. “Art,” he says of it himself, “has not  wrote here, neither was there any time to consider how to set it  punctually down, according to the Understanding of the Letters, but  all was ordered according to the Direction of the Spirit, which often  went in haste, so that in many words Letters may be wanting, and in  some Places a Capital Letter for a Word; so that the Penman’s  Hand, by reason he was not accustomed to it, did often shake. And  though I could have <a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></a> <a name="an_iv.v-Page_297"></a> wrote in a more accurate, fair  and plain Manner, yet the Reason was this, that the burning Fire often  forced forward with Speed and the Hand and Pen must hasten directly  after it, for it comes and goes as a sudden shower.”   <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_627"><font size="1">628</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p141"></a>No description could give more vividly than this the  spontaneous and uncontrollable character of these automatic states;  the welling-up of new knowledge, the rapid formation of sentences: so  quick, that the hand of the subject can hardly keep pace with that  “burning Fire,” the travail of his inner mind. As in  vision, so here, the contents of that inner mind, its hoarded memories  will influence the form of the message. Hence, in Boehme’s  works, the prevalence of that obscure Kabalistic and Alchemical  imagery which baffles even his most eager readers, and which is the  result of an earlier acquaintance with the works of Paracelsus,  Weigel, and Sebastian Franck.   <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_628"><font size="1">629</font></a>
     Such language, however, no more discredits the “power behind  the pen,” than the form under which St. Catherine of Siena  apprehended the mystic marriage discredits her attainment of the  unitive life. In the fruit of such automatic travail, such a  “wrestling with the Angel in the way,” the mystic offers  to our common humanity the chalice of the Spirit of Life. We may  recognize the origins of the ornament upon the chalice: but we cannot  justly charge him with counterfeiting the Wine.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.v-p143"></a>We have been dealing throughout this section with  means rather than with ends: means snatched at by the struggling self  which has not yet wholly shaken itself free from “image,”  in its efforts to seize somehow—actualize, enjoy, and  adore—that Absolute which is the sum of its desires. No one will  ever approach an understanding of this phase of the mystical  consciousness, who brings to it either a contempt for the minds which  could thus simply and sometimes childishly objectivize the Divine, or  a superstitious reverence for the image, apart from the formless  Reality at which it hints. Between these two extremes lies our hope of  grasping the true place of automatisms on the Mystic Way: of seeing in  them instances of the adaptation of those means by which we obtain  consciousness of the phenomenal world, to an apprehension of that  other world whose attainment is humanity’s sublimest end.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iv.v-p25"></a>          Thus too in the case of St. Catherine of Siena, the intense    spiritual strain of that three years’ retreat which I have    already described     <i>(supra,</i>      Pt. II, Cap 1.) showed itself towards the end of the period by a    change in the character of her visions. These, which had previously    been wholly concerned with intuitions of the good and beautiful, now    took on an evil aspect and greatly distressed her (Vita (Acta SS.),    i. xi. 1; see E. Gardner, “St. Catherine of Siena,” p.    20). We are obliged to agree with Pratt that such visions as these    are “pathological phenomena quite on a level with other    hallucinations.”(“The Religious Consciousness,” p    405.)</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iv.v-p28"></a>          An excellent example of such appropriation of material is related    without comment by Huysmans (“Sainte Lyndwine de    Schiedam,” p. 258): “Lydwine found again in heaven those    forms of adoration, those ceremonial practices of the divine office,    which she had known here below during her years of health. The    Church Militant had been, in fact, initiated by the inspiration of    its apostles, its popes, and its saints into the liturgic joys of    Paradise.” In this same vision, which occurred on Christmas    Eve, when the hour of the Nativity was rung from the belfries of    heaven, the Divine Child appeared on His Mother’s knee: just    as the crèche is exhibited in Catholic churches the moment that    Christmas has dawned.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iv.v-p94"></a>          Par. xxx. 61-81: “And I saw light in the form of a river    blazing with radiance, streaming between banks painted with a    marvellous spring. Out of that river issued living sparks and    settled on the flowers on every side, like rubies set in gold. Then,    as it were inebriated by the perfume, they plunged again into the    wondrous flood, and as one entered another issued forth. . . . Then    added the Sun of my eyes: The river, the topazes that enter and come    forth, the smiling flowers are shadowy foretastes of their reality.    Not that these things are themselves imperfect; but on thy side is    the defect, in that thy vision cannot rise so high.” This    passage probably owes something to Mechthild of Magdeburg’s    concept of Deity as a Flowing Light.</p>

So too the form assumed by many of the visions of Angela of    Foligno is obviously due to her familiarity with the frescoed    churches of Assisi and the Vale of Spoleto. “When I bent my    knees upon entering in at the door of the church,” she says,    “I immediately beheld a picture of St. Francis lying in    Christ’s bosom. Then said Christ unto me, ‘Thus closely    will I hold thee and so much closer, that bodily eyes can neither    perceive nor comprehend it’.”     <i>(op. cit.,</i>      p. 53.

Angela of Foligno says of a    similar vision of Christ, “His beauty and adornment were so    great . . . and so great was my joy at the sight, that I think I    shall never lose it. And so great was my certitude that I cannot    doubt it in any point” (St. Angèle de Foligno,     <i>op. cit</i>     ., p. 66. English translation, p. 229).</p>

In the ring which she always saw upon her finger. we seem to    have an instance of true corporeal vision; which finds a curiously    exact parallel in the life of St. Teresa. “On one occasion    when I was holding in my hand the cross of my rosary, He took it    from me into His own hand. He returned it, but it was then four    large stones incomparably more precious than diamonds. He said to me    that for the future that cross would so appear to me always:     <i>and so it did.</i>      I never saw the wood of which it was made, but only the precious    stones. They were seen, however, by no one else” (Vida, cap.    xxix. § 8). This class of experience, says Augustine Baker,    particularly gifts of roses, rings, and jewels, is “much to be    suspected,” except in “souls of a long-continued    sanctity” (“Holy Wisdom.” Treatise iii. § iv.    cap. iii.).</p>
