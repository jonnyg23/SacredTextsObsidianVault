 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p1"></a>We<a name="an_iii.iii-p1.1"></a> come now to consider the mental apparatus which is at the disposal of  the self: to ask what it can tell us of the method by which she may  escape from the prison of the sense-world, transcend its rhythm, and  attain knowledge of—or conscious contact with—a  supra-sensible Reality. We have seen the normal self shut within that  prison, and making, by the help of science and of philosophy, a survey  of the premises and furniture: testing the thickness of the walls and  speculating on the possibility of trustworthy news from without  penetrating to her cell. Shut with her in that cell, two forces, the  desire to know more and the desire to love more, are ceaselessly at  work. Where the first of these cravings predominates, we call the  result a philosophical or a scientific temperament; where it is  overpowered by the ardour of unsatisfied love, the self’s  reaction upon things becomes poetic, artistic, and  characteristically—though not always  explicitly—religious.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p2"></a>We have seen further that a certain number of persons  declare that they have escaped from the prison. Have they done so, it  can only be in order to satisfy these two hungry desires, for these,  and these only, make that a prison which might otherwise be a  comfortable hotel; and since, in varying degrees, these desires are in  all of us, active or latent, it is clearly worth while to discover, if  we can, the weak point in the walls, and method of achieving this one  possible way of escape. <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_45"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p3"></a>Before we try to define in psychological language the  way in which the mystic slips the fetters of sense, sets out upon his  journey towards home, it seems well to examine the machinery which is  at the disposal of the normal, conscious self: the creature, or part  of a creature, which we recognize as “ourselves.” The  older psychologists were accustomed to say that the messages from the  outer world awaken in that self three main forms of activity. (1) They  arouse movements of attraction or repulsion, of desire or distaste;  which vary in intensity from the semi-conscious cravings of the hungry  infant to the passions of the lover, artist, or fanatic. (2) They  stimulate a sort of digestive process, in which she combines and  cogitates upon the material presented to her; finally absorbing a  certain number of the resulting concepts and making them part of  herself or of her world, (3) The movements of desire, or the action of  reason, or both in varying combinations, awaken in her a determination  by which percept and concept issue in action; bodily, mental, or  spiritual. Hence, the main aspects of the self were classified as  Emotion, Intellect, and Will: and the individual temperament was  regarded as emotional, intellectual, or volitional, according to  whether feeling, thought, or will assumed the reins.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p4"></a>Modern psychologists have moved away from this  diagrammatic conception, and incline more and more to dwell upon the  unity of the psyche—that hypothetical self which none have ever  seen—and on some aspect of its energetic desire, its   <i>libido,</i>    or “hormic drive” as the ruling factor of its life. These  conceptions are useful to the student of mysticism, though they cannot  be accepted uncritically or regarded as complete.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p5"></a>Now the unsatisfied psyche in her emotional aspect  wants, as we have said, to love more; her curious intellect wants to  know more. The awakened human creature suspects that both appetites  are being kept on a low diet; that there really is more to love, and  more to know, somewhere in the mysterious world without, and further  that its powers of affection and understanding are worthy of some  greater and more durable objective than that provided by the illusions  of sense. Urged therefore by the cravings of feeling or of thought,  consciousness is always trying to run out to the encounter of the  Absolute, and always being forced to return. The neat philosophical  system, the diagrams of science, the “sunset-touch,” are  tried in turn. Art and life, the accidents of our humanity, may foster  an emotional outlook; till the moment in which the neglected intellect  arises and pronounces such an outlook to have no validity. Metaphysics  and science seem to offer to the intellect an open window towards  truth; till the heart looks out and declares this landscape to be a  chill desert in which <a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_46"></a> she can find no  nourishment. These diverse aspects of things must be either fused or  transcended if the whole self is to be satisfied; for the reality  which she seeks has got to meet both claims and pay in full.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p6"></a>When Dionysius the Areopagite divided those angels who  stand nearest God into the Seraphs who are aflame with perfect love,  and the Cherubs who are filled with perfect knowledge, he only gave  expression to the two most intense aspirations of the human soul, and  described under an image the two-fold condition of that Beatific  Vision which is her goal.   <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">57</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p8"></a>There is a sense in which it may be said, that the  desire of knowledge is a part of the desire of perfect love: since one  aspect of that all inclusive passion is clearly a longing to know, in  the deepest, fullest, closest sense, the thing adored. Love’s  characteristic activity—for Love, all wings, is inherently  active, and “cannot be lazy,” as the mystics say—is  a quest, an outgoing towards an object desired, which only when  possessed will be fully known, and only when fully known can be  perfectly adored.   <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">58</font></a>
     Intimate communion, no less than worship, is of its essence. Joyous  fruition is its proper end. This is true of all Love’s quests,  whether the Beloved be human or divine—the bride, the Grail, the  Mystic Rose, the Plenitude of God. But there is no sense in which it  can be said that the desire of love is merely a part of the desire of  perfect knowledge: for that strictly intellectual ambition includes no  adoration, no self-spending, no reciprocity of feeling between Knower  and Known. Mere knowledge, taken alone, is a matter of receiving, not  of acting: of eyes, not wings: a dead alive business at the best.  There is thus a sharp distinction to be drawn between these two great  expressions of life: the energetic love, the passive knowledge. One is  related to the eager, outgoing activity, the dynamic impulse to   <i>do</i>    somewhat, physical, mental, or spiritual, which is inherent in all  living things and which psychologists call   <i>conation:</i>    the other to the indwelling consciousness, the passive knowing  somewhat, which they call   <i>cognition.</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p10"></a>Now “conation” is almost wholly the  business of will, but of will stimulated by emotion: for wilful action  of every kind, however intellectual it may seem, is always the result  of interest, and <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_47"></a> interest involves  feeling. We act because we feel we want to; feel we must. Whether the  inspiring force be a mere preference or an overwhelming urge, our  impulse to “do” is a synthesis of determination and  desire. All man’s achievements are the result of conation, never  of mere thought. “The intellect by itself moves nothing,”  said Aristotle, and modern psychology has but affirmed this law. Hence  his quest of Reality is never caused, though it may be greatly  assisted, by the intellectual aspect of his consciousness; for the  reasoning powers as such have little initiative. Their province is  analytic, not exploratory. They stay at home, dissecting and arranging  matter that comes to hand; and do not adventure beyond their own  region in search of food. Thought does not penetrate far into an  object in which the self feels no interest—  <i>i.e.</i>   , towards which she does not experience a “conative”  movement of attraction, of desire—for interest is the only  method known to us of arousing the will, and securing the fixity of  attention necessary to any intellectual process. None think for long  about anything for which they do not care; that is to say, which does  not touch some aspect of their emotional life. They may hate it, love  it, fear it, want it; but they must have some feeling about it.  Feeling is the tentacle we stretch out to the world of things.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p11"></a>Here the lesson of psychology is the same as that  which Dante brought back from his pilgrimage; the supreme importance  and harmonious movement of <a name="an_iii.iii-p11.1"></a>  <i>il desiro</i>     and   <i><a name="an_iii.iii-p11.2"></a> il velle. Si come rota  ch’egualmente è mossa ,</i>    <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_58"><font size="1">59</font></a>
    these move together to fulfil the Cosmic Plan. In all human life, in  so far as it is not merely a condition of passive  “awareness,” the law which he found implicit in the  universe is the law of the individual mind. Not logic, not  “common sense,”but   <i><a name="an_iii.iii-p12.1"></a> l’amor che move il sole e le altre  stelle</i>   the motive force of the spirit of man: in the  inventors, the philosophers, and the artists, no less than in the  heroes and in the saints.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p13"></a>The vindication of the importance of feeling in our  life, and in particular its primacy over reason in all that has to do  with man’s contact with the transcendental world, has been one  of the great achievements of modern psychology. In the sphere of  religion it is now acknowledged that “God known of the  heart” gives a better account of the character of our spiritual  experience than “God guessed at by the brain”; that the  loving intuition is more fruitful and more trustworthy than the  dialectic proof. One by one the commonplaces of mysticism are thus  rediscovered by official science, and given their proper place in the  psychology of the spiritual life. Thus Leuba, hardly a friendly  witness, is found to agree with the Fourth Evangelist that  “Life, more life, a larger, richer, more satisfying life, is in  the last analysis the end of <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_48"></a>  religion,”   <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_59"><font size="1">60</font></a>
     and we have seen that life, as we know it, has the character of a  purposive striving, more directly dependent on will and feeling then  on thought. Of this drive, this urge, thought indeed is but the  servant; a skilled and often arrogant servant, with a constant  tendency to usurpation. Some form of feeling—interest, desire,  fear, appetite—must supply the motive power. Without this, the  will would be dormant, and the intellect lapse into a calculating  machine.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p15"></a>Further, “the heart has its reasons which the  mind knows not of.” It is a matter of experience that in our  moments of deep emotion, transitory though they be, we plunge deeper  into the reality of things than we can hope to do in hours of the most  brilliant argument. At the touch of passion doors fly open which logic  has battered on in vain: for passion rouses to activity not merely the  mind, but the whole vitality of man. It is the lover, the poet, the  mourner, the convert, who shares for a moment the mystic’s  privilege of lifting that Veil of Isis which science handles so  helplessly, leaving only her dirty fingermarks behind. The heart,  eager and restless, goes out into the unknown, and brings home,  literally and actually, “fresh food for thought.” Hence  those who “feel to think” are likely to possess a richer,  more real, if less orderly, experience than those who “think to  feel.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p16"></a>This psychological law, easily proved in regard to  earthly matters, holds good also upon the supersensual plane. It was  expressed once for all by the author of “The Cloud of  Unknowing” when he said of God, “By love He may be gotten  and holden, but by thought of understanding, never.”   <a name="fr_60"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">61</font></a>
     That exalted feeling, that “secret blind love pressing,”  not the neat deductions of logic, the apologist’s  “proofs” of the existence of the Absolute, unseals the  eyes to things unseen before. “Therefore,” says the same  mystic “what time that thou purposest thee to this work, and  feelest by grace that thou art called of God, lift then up thine heart  unto God with a meek stirring of love; and mean God that made thee and  bought thee, and that graciously hath called thee to thy degree and  receive none other thought of God. And yet not all these but if thou  list; for it sufficeth thee enough, a naked intent direct unto God  without any other cause than Himself.”   <a name="fr_61"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">62</font></a>
     Here we see emotion at its proper work; the movement of desire  passing over at once into the act of concentration, the gathering up  of all the powers of the self into a state of determined attention,  which is the business of the Will. “This driving and  drawing,” says Ruysbroeck, “we feel in the heart and in  the unity of all our bodily powers, and especially in the desirous  powers.”   <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">63</font></a>
     This act of perfect concentration, <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_49"></a> the  passionate focussing of the self upon one point, when it is applied  “with a naked intent” to real and transcendental things,  constitutes in the technical language of mysticism the state of  recollection:   <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">64</font></a>
     a condition which is peculiarly characteristic of the mystical  consciousness, and is the necessary prelude of pure contemplation,  that state in which the mystic enters into communion with Reality.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p21"></a>We have then arrived so far in our description of the  mechanism of the mystic. Possessed like other men of powers of  feeling, thought, and will, it is essential that his love and his  determination, even more than his thought, should be set upon  Transcendent Reality. He must feel a strong emotional attraction  toward the supersensual Object of his quest: that love which  scholastic philosophy defined as the force or power which causes every  creature to follow out the trend of its own nature. Of this must be  born the will to attain communion with that Absolute Object. This  will, this burning and active desire, must crystallize into and  express itself by that definite and conscious concentration of the  whole self upon the Object, which precedes the contemplative state. We  see already how far astray are those who look upon the mystical  temperament as passive in type.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p22"></a>Our next concern, then, would seem to be with this  condition of contemplation: what it does and whither it leads. What is  (a) its psychological explanation and (b) its empirical value? Now, in  dealing with this, and other rare mental conditions, we are of course  trying to describe from without that which can only adequately be  described from within; which is as much as to say that only mystics  can really write about mysticism. Fortunately, many mystics have so  written; and we, from their experiences and from the explorations of  psychology upon another plane, are able to make certain elementary  deductions. It appears generally from these that the act of  contemplation is for the mystic a psychic gateway; a method of going  from one level of consciousness to another. In technical language it  is the condition under which he shifts his “field of  perception” and obtains his characteristic outlook on the  universe. That there is such a characteristic outlook, peculiar to no  creed or race, is proved by the history of mysticism; which  demonstrates plainly enough that in some men another sort of  consciousness, another “sense,” may be liberated beyond  the normal powers we have discussed. This “sense” has  attachments at each point to emotion, to intellect, and to will. It  can express itself under each of the aspects which these terms  connote. Yet it differs from and transcends the emotional,  intellectual, and volitional life of ordinary men. It was recognized  by <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_50"></a> Plato as that consciousness which  could apprehend the real world of the Ideas. Its development is the  final object of that education which his “Republic”  describes. It is called by Plotinus “Another intellect,  different from that which reasons and is denominated rational.”   <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">65</font></a>
     Its business, he says, is the perception of the  supersensual—or, in Neoplatonic language, the   <i>intelligible</i>    world. It is the sense which, in the words of the “Theologia  Germanica,” has “the power of seeing into eternity,”   <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">66</font></a>
     the “mysterious eye of the soul” by which St. Augustine  saw “the light that never changes.”   <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">67</font></a>
     It is, says Al Ghazzali, a Persian mystic of the eleventh century,  “like an immediate perception, as if one touched its object with  one’s hand.”   <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>
     In the words of his great Christian successor, St. Bernard, “it  may be defined as the soul’s true unerring intuition, the  unhesitating apprehension of truth”:   <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a>
     which “simple vision of truth,” says St. Thomas Aquinas,  “ends in a movement of desire.”   <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">70</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p29"></a>It is infused with burning love, for it seems to its  possessors to be primarily a movement of the heart: with intellectual  subtlety, for its ardour is wholly spent upon the most sublime object  of thought: with unflinching will, for its adventures are undertaken  in the teeth of the natural doubts, prejudices, languors, and  self-indulgence of man. These adventures, looked upon by those who  stay at home as a form of the Higher Laziness, are in reality the last  and most arduous labours which the human spirit is called to perform.  They are the only known methods by which we can come into conscious  possession of all our powers; and, rising from the lower to the higher  levels of consciousness, become aware of that larger life in which we  are immersed, attain communion with the transcendent Personality in  Whom that life is resumed.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p30"></a>Mary has chosen the better, not the idler part; for  her gaze is directed towards those First Principles without which the  activity of Martha would have no meaning at all. In vain does sardonic  common sense, confronted with the contemplative type, reiterate the  sneer of Mucius, “Encore sont-ils heureux que la pauvre Marthe  leur fasse la cuisine.” It remains a paradox of the mystics that  the passivity at which they appear to aim is really a state of the  most intense activity: more, that where it is wholly absent no great  creative action can take place. In it, the superficial self compels  itself to be still, in order that it may liberate another <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_51"></a> more deep-seated power which is, in the ecstasy  of the contemplative genius, raised to the highest pitch of  efficiency.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p31"></a>“This restful travail,” said Walter  Hilton, “is full far from fleshly idleness and from blind  security. It is full of ghostly work but it is called rest, for grace  looseth the heavy yoke of fleshly love from the soul and maketh it  mighty and free through the gift of the holy ghostly love for to work  gladly, softly, and delectably. . . . Therefore is it called an holy  idleness and a rest most busy; and so is it in   <i>stillness</i>    from the great crying and the beastly noise of fleshly  desires.”   <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">71</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p33"></a>If those who have cultivated this latent power be  correct in their statements, the self was mistaken in supposing  herself to be entirely shut off from the true external universe. She  has, it seems certain tentacles which, once she learns to uncurl them,  will stretch sensitive fingers far beyond that limiting envelope in  which her normal consciousness is contained, and give her news of a  higher reality than that which can be deduced from the reports of the  senses. The fully developed and completely conscious human soul can  open as an anemone does, and   <i>know</i>    the ocean in which she is bathed. This act, this condition of  consciousness, in which barriers are obliterated, the Absolute flows  in on us, and we, rushing out to its embrace, “find and feel the  Infinite above all reason and above all knowledge,”   <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">72</font></a>
     is the true “mystical state.” The value of contemplation  is that it tends to produce this state, release this transcendental  sense; and so turns the “lower servitude” in which the  natural man lives under the sway of his earthly environment to the  “higher servitude” of fully conscious dependence on that  Reality “in Whom we live and move and have our being.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p35"></a>What then, we ask, is the nature of this special  sense—this transcendental consciousness—and how does  contemplation liberate it?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p36"></a>Any attempt to answer this question brings upon the  scene another aspect of man’s psychic life: an aspect of  paramount importance to the student of the mystic type. We have  reviewed the chief ways in which our surface consciousness reacts upon  experience: a surface consciousness which has been trained through  long ages to deal with the universe of sense. We know, however, that  the personality of man is a far deeper and more mysterious thing than  the sum of his conscious feeling, thought and will: that this  superficial self—this Ego of which each of us is  aware—hardly counts in comparison with the deeps of being which  it hides. “There is a root or depth in thee,” says Law,  “from whence all these faculties come forth as lines from a  centre, <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_52"></a> or as branches from the body of  a tree. This depth is called the centre, the fund, or bottom, of the  soul. This depth is the unity, the Eternity, I had almost said the  infinity of thy soul, for it is so infinite that nothing can satisfy  it, or give it any rest, but the infinity of God.”   <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">73</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p38"></a>Since normal man is utterly unable to set up relations  with spiritual reality by means of his feeling, thought, and will, it  is clearly in this depth of being—in these unplumbed levels of  personality—that we must search, if we would find the organ, the  power, by which he is to achieve the mystic quest. That alteration of  consciousness which takes place in contemplation can only mean the  emergence from this “fund or bottom of the soul” of some  faculty which diurnal life keeps hidden “in the  deeps.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p39"></a>Modern psychology, in its doctrine of the unconscious  or subliminal personality, has acknowledged this fact of a range of  psychic life lying below and beyond the conscious field. Indeed, it  has so dwelt upon and defined this shadowy region—which is  really less a “region” than a useful name—that it  sometimes seems to know more about the unconscious than about the  conscious life of man. There it finds, side by side, the sources of  his most animal instincts, his least explicable powers, his most  spiritual intuitions: the “ape and tiger,” and the  “soul.” Genius and prophecy, insomnia and infatuation,  clairvoyance, hypnotism, hysteria, and “Christian”  science—all are explained by the “unconscious mind.”  In his destructive moods the psychologist has little apparent  difficulty in reducing the chief phenomena of religious and mystical  experience to activities of the “unconscious,” seeking an  oblique satisfaction of repressed desires. Where he undertakes the  more dangerous duties of apologetic, he explains the same phenomena by  saying that “God speaks to man in the subconsciousness,”   <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a>
     by which he can only mean that our apprehensions of the eternal have  the character of intuition rather than of thought. Yet the  “unconscious” after all is merely a convenient name for  the aggregate of those powers, parts, or qualities of the whole self  which at any given moment are not conscious, or that the Ego is not  conscious of. Included in the unconscious region of an average healthy  man are all those automatic activities by which the life of the body  is carried on: all those “uncivilized” instincts and  vices, those remains of the ancestral savage, which education has  <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_53"></a> forced out of the stream of  consciousness and which now only send their messages to the surface in  a carefully disguised form. There too work in the hiddenness those  longings for which the busy life of the world leaves no place; and  there lies that deep pool, that heart of personality, from which in  moments of lucidity a message may reach the conscious field. Hence in  normal men the best and worst, most savage and most spiritual parts of  character, are bottled up “below the threshold.” Often the  partisans of the “unconscious” forget to mention this.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p41"></a>It follows, then, that whilst we may find it  convenient and indeed necessary to avail ourselves of the symbols and  diagrams of psychology in tracking out the mystic way, we must not  forget the large and vague significance which attaches to these  symbols, and the hypothetical character of many of the entities they  represent. Nor must we allow ourselves to use the  “unconscious” as the equivalent of man’s  transcendental sense. Here the mystics have surely displayed a more  scientific spirit, a more delicate power of analysis, than the  psychologists. They, too, were aware that in normal men the spiritual  sense lies below the threshold of consciousness. Though they had not  at their command the spatial metaphors of the modern school, and could  not describe man’s ascent toward God in those picturesque terms  of levels and uprushes, margins and fields, projection, repression,  and sublimation, which now come so naturally to investigators of the  spiritual life, they leave us in no doubt as to their view of the  facts. Further, man’s spiritual history primarily meant for  them, as it means for us, the emergence of this transcendental sense;  its capture of the field of consciousness, and the opening up of those  paths which permit the inflow of a larger spiritual life, the  perception of a higher reality. This, in so far as it was an isolated  act, was “contemplation.” When it was part of the general  life process, and had permanent results, they called it the New Birth,  which “maketh alive.” The faculty or personality concerned  in the “New Birth”—the “spiritual man,”  capable of the spiritual vision and life, which was dissociated from  the “earthly man” adapted only to the natural  life—was always sharply distinguished by them from the total  personality, conscious or unconscious. It was something definite; a  bit or spot of man which, belonging not to Time but to Eternity, was  different in kind from the rest of his human nature, framed in all  respects to meet the demands of the merely natural world.   <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a>
     The business of the mystic in the eyes of these old specialists was  to remake, transmute, his total personality in the interest <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_54"></a> of his spiritual self; to bring it out of the  hiddenness, and unify himself about it as a centre, thus  “putting on divine humanity.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p43"></a>The divine nucleus, the point of contact between  man’s life and the divine life in which it is immersed and  sustained, has been given many names in course of the development of  mystical doctrine. All clearly mean the same thing, though emphasizing  different aspects of its life. Sometimes it is called the Synteresis,   <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a>
     the keeper or preserver of his being: sometimes the Spark of the  Soul, the <a name="an_iii.iii-p44.1"></a>  <i>Fünklein</i>     of the German mystics: sometimes its Apex the point  at which it touches the heavens. Then, with a sudden flight to the  other end of the symbolic scale, and in order to emphasize its  participation in pure Being, rather than its difference from mere  nature, it is called the Ground of the Soul, the foundation or basal  stuff indwelt by God, whence springs all spiritual life. Clearly all  these guesses and suggestions aim at one goal and are all to be  understood in a symbolic sense; for, as Malaval observed in answer to  his disciples’ anxious inquiries on this subject, “since  the soul of man is a spiritual thing and thus cannot have divisions or  parts, consequently it cannot have height or depth, summit or surface.  But because we judge spiritual things by the help of material things,  since we know these better and they are more familiar to us, we call  the highest of all forms of conception the summit, and the easier way  of comprehending things the surface, of the understanding.”   <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">77</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p46"></a>Here at any rate, whatever name we may choose to give  it, is the organ of man’s spiritual consciousness; the place  where he meets the Absolute, the germ of his real life. Here is the  seat of that deep “Transcendental Feeling,” the  “beginning and end of metaphysics” which is, says  Professor Stewart, “at once the solemn sense of Timeless  Being—of ‘That which was and is and ever shall be’  overshadowing us—and the conviction that Life is good.”  “I hold,” says the same writer, “that it is in  Transcendental Feeling, manifested normally as Faith in the Value of  Life, and ecstatically as sense of Timeless Being, and not in Thought  proceeding by way of speculative construction, that Consciousness  comes nearest to the object of metaphysics, Ultimate Reality.”   <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">78</font></a>
     <a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_55"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p48"></a>The existence of such a “sense,” such an  integral part or function of the complete human being, has been  affirmed and dwelt upon not only by the mystics, but by seers and  teachers of all times and creeds: by Egypt, Greece, and India, the  poets, the fakirs, the philosophers, and the saints. A belief in its  actuality is the pivot of the Christian position; indeed of every  religion worthy of the name. It is the justification of mysticism,  asceticism, the whole machinery of the self-renouncing life. That  there is an extreme point at which man’s nature touches the  Absolute: that his ground, or substance, his true being, is penetrated  by the Divine Life which constitutes the underlying reality of things;  this is the basis on which the whole mystic claim of possible union  with God must rest. Here, they say, is our link with reality; and in  this place alone can be celebrated the “marriage from which the  Lord comes.”   <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p50"></a>To use another of their diagrams, it is thanks to the  existence within him of this immortal spark from the central fire,  that man is implicitly a “child of the infinite.” The  mystic way must therefore be a life, a discipline, which will so alter  the constituents of his mental life as to include this spark within  the conscious field; bring it out of the hiddenness, from those deep  levels where it sustains and guides his normal existence, and make it  the dominant element round which his personality is arranged.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p51"></a>It is clear that under ordinary conditions, and save  for sudden gusts of “Transcendental Feeling” induced by  some saving madness such as Religion, Art, or Love, the superficial  self knows nothing of the attitude of this silent watcher—this  “Dweller in the Innermost”—towards the incoming  messages of the external world: nor of the activities which they awake  in it. Concentrated on the sense-world, and the messages she receives  from it, she knows nothing of the relations which exist between this  subject and the unattainable Object of all thought. But by a  deliberate inattention to the messages of the senses, such as that  which is induced by contemplation, the mystic can bring the ground of  the soul, the seat of “Transcendental Feeling,” within the  area of consciousness: making it amenable to the activity of the will.  Thus becoming unaware of his usual and largely fictitious  “external world,” another and more substantial set of  perceptions, which never have their chance under normal conditions,  rise to the surface. Sometimes these unite with the normal reasoning  faculties. More often, they supersede them. Some such exchange, such  “losing to find,” appears to be necessary, if man’s  transcendental powers are to have their full chance.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p52"></a>“The two eyes of the soul of man,” says  the “Theologia <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_56"></a> Germanica,” here  developing a profound Platonic image, “cannot both perform their  work at once: but if the soul shall see with the right eye into  eternity, then the left eye must close itself and refrain from  working, and be as though it were dead. For if the left eye be  fulfilling its office toward outward things, that is holding converse  with time and the creatures; then must the right eye be hindered in  its working; that is, in its contemplation. Therefore, whosoever will  have the one must let the other go; for ‘no man can serve two  masters.’“   <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p54"></a>There is within us an immense capacity for perception,  for the receiving of messages from outside; and a very little  consciousness which deals with them. It is as if one telegraph  operator were placed in charge of a multitude of lines: all may be in  action, but he can only attend to one at a time. In popular language,  there is not enough consciousness to go round. Even upon the sensual  plane, no one can be aware of more than a few things at once. These  fill the centre of our field of consciousness: as the object on which  we happen to have focussed our vision dominates our field of sight.  The other matters within that field retreat to the margin. We know,  dimly, that they are there; but we pay them no attention and should  hardly miss them if they ceased to exist.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p55"></a>Transcendental matters are, for most of us, always  beyond the margin; because most of us have given up our whole  consciousness to the occupation of the senses, and permitted them to  construct there a universe in which we are contented to remain. Only  in certain states—recollection, contemplation, ecstasy and their  allied conditions—does the self contrive to turn out the usual  tenants, shut the “gateways of the flesh,” and let those  submerged powers which are capable of picking up messages from another  plane of being have their turn. Then it is the sense-world which  retreats beyond the margin, and another landscape that rushes in. At  last, then, we begin to see something of what contemplation does for  its initiates. It is one of the many names applied to that chain of  processes which have for their object this alteration of the mental  equilibrium: the putting to sleep of that “Normal Self”  which usually wakes, and the awakening of that “Transcendental  Self” which usually sleeps. To man, “meeting-point of  various stages of reality,” is given—though he seldom  considers it—this unique power of choosing his universe.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p56"></a>The phenomenon known as double or disintegrated  personality may perhaps give us a hint as to the mechanical nature of  the change which contemplation effects. In this psychic malady the  total character of the patient is split up; a certain group of  qualities <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_57"></a> are, as it were, abstracted  from the surface-consciousness and so closely associated as to form in  themselves a complete “character” or  “personality”—necessarily poles asunder from the  “character” which the self usually shows to the world,  since it consists exclusively of those elements which are omitted from  it. Thus in the classical case of Miss Beauchamp, the investigator,  Dr. Morton Prince, called the three chief “personalities,”  from their ruling characteristics, “the Saint,” “the  Woman,” and “the Devil.”   <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a>
     The totality of character which composed the “real Miss  Beauchamp” had split up into these contrasting types; each of  which was excessive, because withdrawn from the control of the rest.  When, voluntarily or involuntarily, the personality which had  possession of the field of consciousness was lulled to sleep, one of  the others emerged. Hypnotism was one of the means which most easily  effected this change.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p58"></a>Now in persons of mystical genius, the qualities which  the stress of normal life tends to keep below the threshold of  consciousness are of enormous strength. In these natural explorers of  Eternity the “transcendental faculty,” the “eye of  the soul,” is not merely present in embryo, but is highly  developed; and is combined with great emotional and volitional power.  The result of the segregation of such qualities below the threshold of  consciousness is to remove from them the friction of those  counterbalancing traits in the surface mind with which they might  collide. They are “in the hiddenness,” as Jacob Boehme  would say. There they develop unchecked, until a point is reached at  which their strength is such that they break their bounds and emerge  into the conscious field: either temporarily dominating the subject as  in ecstasy, or permanently transmuting the old self, as in the  “unitive life.” The attainment of this point may be  accelerated by processes which have always been known and valued by  the mystics; and which tend to produce a state of consciousness  classed by psychologists with dreams, reverie, and the results of  hypnosis. In all these the normal surface-consciousness is  deliberately or involuntarily lulled, the images and ideas connected  with normal life are excluded, and images or faculties from  “beyond the threshold” are able to take their place.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p59"></a>Of course these images or faculties may or may not be  more valuable than those already present in the surface-consciousness.  In the ordinary subject, often enough, they are but the odds and ends  for which the superficial mind has found no use. In the mystic, they  are of a very different order: and this fact justifies the means which  he instinctively employs to secure their emergence. Indian mysticism  founds its external system almost wholly <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_58"></a>  on (  <i>a</i>   ) Asceticism, the domination of the senses, and (  <i>b</i>   ) the deliberate practice of self-hypnotization; either by fixing the  eyes on a near object, or by the rhythmic repetition of the   <i>mantra</i>    or sacred word. By these complementary forms of discipline, the pull  of the phenomenal world is diminished and the mind is placed at the  disposal of the subconscious powers. Dancing, music, and other  exaggerations of natural rhythm have been pressed into the same  service by the Greek initiates of Dionysus, by the Gnostics, by  innumerable other mystic cults. That these proceedings do effect a  remarkable change in the human consciousness is proved by experience:  though how and why they do it is as yet little understood. Such  artificial and deliberate production of ecstasy is against the whole  instinct of the Christian contemplatives; but here and there amongst  them also we find instances in which ecstatic trance or lucidity, the  liberation of the “transcendental sense,” was  inadvertently produced by purely physical means. Thus Jacob Boehme,  the “Teutonic theosopher,” having one day as he sat in his  room “gazed fixedly upon a burnished pewter dish which reflected  the sunshine with great brilliance,” fell into an inward  ecstasy, and it seemed to him as if he could look into the principles  and deepest foundations of things.   <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">82</font></a>
     The contemplation of running water had the same effect on St.  Ignatius Loyola. Sitting on the bank of a river one day, and facing  the stream, which was running deep, “the eyes of his mind were  opened, not so as to see any kind of vision, but so as to understand  and comprehend spiritual things . . . and this with such clearness  that for him all these things were made new.”   <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">83</font></a>
     This method of attaining to mental lucidity by a narrowing and  simplification of the conscious field, finds an apt parallel in the  practice of Immanuel Kant, who “found that he could better  engage in philosophical thought while   <i>gazing steadily</i>    at a neighbouring church steeple.”   <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">84</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p63"></a>It need hardly be said that rationalistic writers,  ignoring the parallels offered by the artistic and philosophic  temperaments, have seized eagerly upon the evidence afforded by such  instances of apparent mono-ideism and self-hypnotization in the lives  of the mystics, and by the physical disturbances which accompany the  ecstatic trance, and sought by its application to attribute all the  abnormal perceptions of contemplative genius to hysteria or other  disease. They have not hesitated to call St. Paul an epileptic. St.  Teresa the “patron saint of hysterics”; and have found  room for most of their spiritual kindred in various departments of the  pathological museum. They have been helped in this grateful task by  the acknowledged fact that the great contemplatives, though <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_59"></a> almost always persons of robust intelligence  and marked practical or intellectual ability—Plotinus, St.  Bernard, the two Ss. Catherine, St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross, and  the Sufi poets Jàmi and Jalalu ‘ddin are cases in  point—have often suffered from bad physical health. More, their  mystical activities have generally reacted upon their bodies in a  definite and special way; producing in several cases a particular kind  of illness and of physical disability, accompanied by pains and  functional disturbances for which no organic cause could be  discovered, unless that cause were the immense strain which exalted  spirit puts upon a body which is adapted to a very different form of  life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p64"></a>It is certain that the abnormal and highly sensitized  type of mind which we call mystical does frequently, but not always,  produce or accompany strange and inexplicable modifications of the  physical organism with which it is linked. The supernatural is not  here in question, except in so far as we are inclined to give that  name to natural phenomena which we do not understand. Such instances  of psycho-physical parallelism as the stigmatizations of the  saints—and indeed of other suggestible subjects hardly to be  ranked as saints—will occur to anyone.   <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">85</font></a>
     I here offer to the reader another less discussed and more  extraordinary example of the modifying influence of the spirit on the  supposed “laws” of bodily life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p66"></a>We know, as a historical fact, unusually well attested  by contemporary evidence and quite outside the sphere of hagiographic  romance, that both St. Catherine of Siena and her namesake St.  Catherine of Genoa—active women as well as ecstatics, the first  a philanthropist, reformer, and politician, the second an original  theologian and for many years the highly efficient matron of a large  hospital—lived, in the first case for years, in the second for  constantly repeated periods of many weeks, without other food than the  consecrated Host which they received at Holy Communion. They did this,  not by way of difficult obedience to a pious vow, but because they  could not live in any other way. Whilst fasting, they were well and  active, capable of dealing with the innumerable responsibilities which  filled their lives. But the attempt to eat even a few  mouthfuls—and this attempt was constantly repeated, for, like  all true saints, they detested eccentricity   <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">86</font></a>
    —at once made them ill and had to be abandoned as useless.   <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">87</font></a>
     <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_60"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p69"></a>In spite of the researches of Murisier,   <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">88</font></a>
     Janet,   <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">89</font></a>
     Ribot,   <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">90</font></a>
     and other psychologists, and their persevering attempts to find a  pathological explanation which will fit all mystic facts, this and  other marked physical peculiarities which accompany the mystical  temperament belong as yet to the unsolved problems of humanity. They  need to be removed both from the sphere of marvel and from that of  disease—into which enthusiastic friends and foes force them by  turn—to the sphere of pure psychology; and there studied  dispassionately with the attention which we so willingly bestow on the  less interesting eccentricities of degeneracy and vice. Their  existence no more discredits the sanity of mysticism or the validity  of its results than the unstable nervous condition usually noticed in  artists—who share to some extent the mystic’s apprehension  of the Real—discredits art. “In such cases as Kant and  Beethoven,” says Von Hügel justly, “a classifier of  humanity according to its psycho-physical phenomena alone would put  these great discoverers and creators, without hesitation, amongst  hopeless and useless hypochondriacs.”   <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">91</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p74"></a>In the case of the mystics the disease of hysteria,  with its astounding variety of mental symptoms, its strange power of  disintegrating, rearranging and enhancing the elements of  consciousness, its tendencies to automatism and ecstasy, has been most  often invoked to provide an explanation of the observed phenomena.  This is as if one sought the source of the genius of Taglioni in the  symptoms of St. Vitus’s dance. Both the art and the disease have  to do with bodily movements. So too both mysticism and hysteria have  to do with the domination of consciousness by one fixed and intense  idea or intuition, which rules the life and is able to produce amazing  physical and psychical results. In the hysteric patient this idea is  often trivial or morbid   <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">92</font></a>
     but has become—thanks to the self’s unstable mental  condition—an obsession. In the mystic the dominant idea is a  great one: so great in fact, that when it is received in its  completeness by the human consciousness, almost of necessity it ousts  all else. It is nothing less than the idea or perception of the  transcendent reality and presence of God. Hence the mono-ideism of the  mystic is rational, whilst that of the hysteric patient is invariably  irrational.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p76"></a>On the whole then, whilst psycho-physical relations  remain so little understood, it would seem more prudent, and certainly  more scientific, to withhold our judgment on the meaning of the  psychophysical <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_61"></a> phenomena which accompany  the mystic life; instead of basing destructive criticism on facts  which are avowedly mysterious and at least capable of more than one  interpretation. To deduce the nature of a compound from the character  of its byproducts is notoriously unsafe.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p77"></a>Our bodies are animal things, made for animal  activities. When a spirit of unusual ardour insists on using its  nerve-cells for other activities, they kick against the pricks; and  inflict, as the mystics themselves acknowledge, the penalty of  “mystical ill-health.” “Believe me, children,”  says Tauler, “one who would know much about these high matters  would often have to keep his bed, for his bodily frame could not  support it.”   <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">93</font></a>
     “I cause thee extreme pain of body,” says the voice of  Love to Mechthild of Magdeburg. “If I gave myself to thee as  often as thou wouldst have me, I should deprive myself of the sweet  shelter I have of thee in this world, for a thousand bodies could not  protect a loving soul from her desire. Therefore the higher the love  the greater the pain.”   <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">94</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p80"></a>On the other hand the exalted personality of the  mystic—his self-discipline, his heroic acceptance of labour and  suffering, and his inflexible will—raises to a higher term that  normal power of mind over body which all possess. Also the  contemplative state—like the hypnotic state in a healthy  person—seems to enhance life by throwing open deeper levels of  personality. The self then drinks at a fountain which is fed by the  Universal Life. True ecstasy is notoriously life-enhancing. In it a  bracing contact with Reality seems to take place, and as a result the  subject is himself more real. Often, says St. Teresa, even the sick  come forth from ecstasy healthy and with new strength; for something  great is then given to the soul.   <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">95</font></a>
     Contact has been set up with levels of being which the daily routine  of existence leaves untouched. Hence the extraordinary powers of  endurance, and independence of external conditions, which the great  ecstatics so often display.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p82"></a>If we see in the mystics, as some have done, the  sporadic beginning of a power, a higher consciousness, towards which  the race slowly tends; then it seems likely enough that where it  appears nerves and organs should suffer under a stress to which they  have not yet become adapted, and that a spirit more highly organized  than its bodily home should be able to impose strange conditions on  the flesh. When man first stood upright, a body long accustomed to go  on all fours, legs which had adjusted themselves to bearing but half  his weight, must have rebelled against this <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_62"></a> unnatural proceeding; inflicting upon its  author much pain and discomfort if not absolute illness. It is at  least permissible to look upon the strange  “psycho-physical” state common amongst the mystics as just  such a rebellion on the part of a normal nervous and vascular system  against the exigencies of a way of life to which it has not yet  adjusted itself.   <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">96</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p84"></a>In spite of such rebellion, and of the tortures to  which it has subjected them, the mystics, oddly enough, are a  long-lived race: an awkward fact for critics of the physiological  school. To take only a few instances from amongst marked ecstatics,  St. Hildegarde lived to be eighty-one, Mechthild of Magdeburg to  eighty-seven, Ruysbroeck to eighty-eight, Suso to seventy, St. Teresa  to sixty-seven, St. Catherine of Genoa and St. Peter of Alcantara to  sixty-three. It seems as though that enhanced life which is the reward  of mystical surrender enabled them to triumph over their bodily  disabilities: and to live and do the work demanded of them under  conditions which would have incapacitated ordinary men.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p85"></a>Such triumphs, which take heroic rank in the history  of the human mind, have been accomplished as a rule in the same way.  Like all intuitive persons, all possessors of genius, all potential  artists—with whom in fact they are closely related—the  mystics have, in psychological language, “thresholds of  exceptional mobility.” That is to say, a slight effort, a slight  departure from normal conditions, will permit their latent or  “subliminal” powers to emerge and occupy the mental field.  A “mobile threshold” may make a man a genius, a lunatic,  or a saint. All depends upon the character of the emerging powers. In  the great mystic, these powers, these tracts of personality lying  below the level of normal consciousness, are of unusual richness; and  cannot be accounted for in terms of pathology. “If it be  true,” says Delacroix, “that the great mystics have not  wholly escaped those nervous blemishes which mark nearly all  exceptional organizations, there is in them a vital and creative  power, a constructive logic, an extended scale of realization—in  a word, a genius—which is, in truth, their essential quality. .  . . The great mystics, creators and inventors who have found a new  form of life and have justified it . . . join, upon the highest  summits of the human spirit, the great simplifiers of the  world.”   <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">97</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p87"></a>The truth, then, so far as we know it at present,  seems to be <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_63"></a> that those powers which are  in contact with the Transcendental Order, and which constitute at the  lowest estimate half the self, are dormant in ordinary men; whose time  and interest are wholly occupied in responding to the stimuli of the  world of sense. With those latent powers sleeps the landscape which  they alone can apprehend. In mystics none of the self is always  dormant. They have roused the Dweller in the Innermost from its  slumbers, and round it have unified their life. Heart, Reason, Will  are there in full action, drawing their incentive not from the  shadow-show of sense, but from the deeps of true Being; where a lamp  is lit, and a consciousness awake, of which the sleepy crowd remains  oblivious. He who says the mystic is but half a man, states the exact  opposite of the truth. Only the mystic can be called a whole man,  since in others half the powers of the self always sleep. This  wholeness of experience is much insisted on by the mystics. Thus the  Divine Voice says to St. Catherine of Siena, “I have also shown  thee the Bridge and the three general steps, placed there for the  three powers of the soul; and I have told thee how no one can attain  to the life of grace unless he has mounted all three steps, that is,  gathered together all the three powers of the soul in My Name.”   <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">98</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p89"></a>In those abnormal types of personality to which we  give the name of genius, we seem to detect a hint of the relations  which may exist between these deep levels of being and the crust of  consciousness. In the poet, the musician, the great mathematician or  inventor, powers lying below the threshold, and hardly controllable by  their owner’s conscious will, clearly take a major part in the  business of perception and conception. In all creative acts, the  larger share of the work is done subconsciously: its emergence is in a  sense automatic. This is equally true of mystics, artists,  philosophers, discoverers, and rulers of men. The great religion,  invention, work of art, always owes its inception to some sudden  uprush of intuitions or ideas for which the superficial self cannot  account; its execution to powers so far beyond the control of that  self, that they seem, as their owner sometimes says, to “come  from beyond.” This is “inspiration”; the opening of  the sluices, so that those waters of truth in which all life is bathed  may rise to the level of consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p90"></a>The great teacher, poet, artist, inventor, never aims  deliberately at his effects. He obtains them he knows not how: perhaps  from a contact of which he is unconscious with that creative plane of  being which the Sufis call the Constructive Spirit, and the Kabalists  Yesod, and which both postulate as lying next behind the world of  sense. “Sometimes,” said the great Alexandrian Jew Philo,  <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_64"></a> “when I have come to my work  empty, I have suddenly become full; ideas being in an invisible manner  showered upon me, and implanted in me from on high; so that through  the influence of divine inspiration, I have become greatly excited,  and have known neither the place in which I was, nor those who were  present, nor myself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was writing;  for then I have been conscious of a richness of interpretation, an  enjoyment of light, a most penetrating insight, a most manifest energy  in all that was to be done; having such an effect on my mind as the  clearest ocular demonstration would have on the eyes.”   <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">99</font></a>
     This is a true creative ecstasy, strictly parallel to the state in  which the mystic performs his mighty works.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p92"></a>To let oneself go, be quiet, receptive, appears to be  the condition under which such contact with the Cosmic Life may be  obtained. “I have noticed that when one paints one should think  of nothing: everything then comes better,” says the young  Raphael to Leonardo da Vinci.   <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">100</font></a>
     The superficial self must here acknowledge its own insufficiency,  must become the humble servant of a more profound and vital  consciousness. The mystics are of the same opinion. “Let the  will quietly and wisely understand,” says St. Teresa,  “that it is not by dint of labour on our part that we can  converse to any good purpose with God.”   <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">101</font></a>
     “The best and noblest way in which thou mayst come into this  Life,” says Eckhart, “is by keeping silence and letting  God work and speak. Where all the powers are withdrawn from their work  and images, there is this word spoken . . . the more thou canst draw  in all thy powers and forget the creature the nearer art thou to this,  and the more receptive.”   <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">102</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p96"></a>Thus Boehme says to the neophyte,   <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a>
     “When both thy intellect and will are quiet and passive to the  expressions of the eternal Word and Spirit, and when thy soul is  winged up above that which is temporal, the outward senses and the  imagination being locked up by holy abstraction,   <i>then</i>    the eternal Hearing, Seeing, and Speaking will be revealed in thee.  Blessed art thou therefore if thou canst stand still from self  thinking and self willing, and canst stop the wheel of thy imagination  and senses.” Then, the conscious mind being passive, the more  divine mind below the threshold—organ of our free creative  life—can emerge and present its reports. In the words of an  older mystic, “The soul, leaving all things and forgetting  herself, is immersed in the ocean <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_65"></a> of  Divine Splendour, and illuminated by the Sublime Abyss of the  Unfathomable Wisdom.”   <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">104</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p99"></a>The “passivity” of contemplation, then, is  a necessary preliminary of spiritual energy: an essential clearing of  the ground. It withdraws the tide of consciousness from the shores of  sense, stops the “wheel of the imagination.” “The  Soul,” says Eckhart again, “is created in a place between  Time and Eternity: with its highest powers it touches Eternity, with  its lower Time.”   <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a>
     These, the worlds of Being and Becoming, are the two “stages of  reality” which meet in the spirit of man. By cutting us off from  the temporal plane, the lower kind of reality, Contemplation gives the  eternal plane, and the powers which can communicate with that plane,  their chance. In the born mystic these powers are great, and lie very  near the normal threshold of consciousness. He has a genius for  transcendental—or as he would say, divine—discovery in  much the same way as his cousins, the born musician and poet, have a  genius for musical or poetic discovery. In all three cases, the  emergence of these higher powers is mysterious, and not least so to  those who experience it. Psychology on the one hand, theology on the  other, may offer us diagrams and theories of this proceeding: of the  strange oscillations of the developing consciousness, the fitful  visitations of a lucidity and creative power over which the self has  little or no control, the raptures and griefs of a vision by turns  granted and withdrawn. But the secret of genius still eludes us, as  the secret of life eludes the biologist.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p101"></a>The utmost we can say of such persons is, that reality  presents itself to them under abnormal conditions and in abnormal  terms, and that subject to these conditions and in these terms they  are bound to deal with it. Thanks to their peculiar mental make up,  one aspect of the universe is for them focussed so sharply that in  comparison with it all other images are blurred, vague, and unreal.  Hence the sacrifice which men of genius—mystics, artists,  inventors—make of their whole lives to this one Object, this one  vision of truth, is not self-denial, but rather self-fulfilment. They  gather themselves up from the unreal, in order to concentrate on the  real. The whole personality then absorbs or enters into communion with  certain rhythms or harmonies existent in the universe, which the  receiving apparatus of other selves cannot take up. “Here is the  finger of God, a flash of the Will that can!” exclaims Abt  Vogler, as the sounds grow under his hand. “The numbers <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_66"></a>   <i>came!“</i>    says the poet. He knows not how, certainly not by deliberate  intellection.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p102"></a>So it is with the mystic. Madame Guyon states in her  autobiography, that when she was composing her works she would  experience a sudden and irresistible inclination to take up her pen;  though feeling wholly incapable of literary composition, and not even  knowing the subject on which she would be impelled to write. If she  resisted this impulse it was at the cost of the most intense  discomfort. She would then begin to write with extraordinary  swiftness; words, elaborate arguments, and appropriate quotations  coming to her without reflection, and so quickly that one of her  longest books was written in one and a half days. “In writing I  saw that I was writing of things which I had never seen: and during  the time of this manifestation, I was given light to perceive that I  had in me treasures of knowledge and understanding which I did not  know that I possessed.”   <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p104"></a>Similar statements are made of St. Teresa, who  declared that in writing her books she was powerless to set down  anything but that which her Master put into her mind.   <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>
     So Blake said of “Milton” and “Jerusalem,”  “I have written the poems from immediate dictation, twelve or  sometimes twenty or thirty lines at a time, without premeditation and  even against my will. The time it has taken in writing was thus  rendered non-existent, and an immense poem exists which seems to be  the labour of a long life, all produced without labour or  study.”   <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">108</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p107"></a>These are, of course, extreme forms of that strange  power of automatic composition, in which words and characters arrive  and arrange themselves in defiance of their authors’ will, of  which most poets and novelists possess a trace. Such composition is  probably related to the automatic writing of “mediums” and  other sensitives; in which the often disorderly and incoherent  subliminal mind seizes upon this channel of expression. The subliminal  mind of the great mystic, however, is not disorderly. It is abnormally  sensitive, richly endowed and keenly observant—a treasure house,  not a lumber room—and becomes in the course of its education, a  highly disciplined and skilled instrument of knowledge. When,  therefore, its contents emerge, and are presented to the normal  consciousness in the form of lucidity, “auditions,”  visions, automatic writing, or any other translations of the  supersensible <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_67"></a> into the terms of sensible  perception, they cannot be discredited because the worthless  unconscious region of feebler natures sometimes manifests itself in  the same way. Idiots are often voluble: but many orators are sane.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p108"></a>Now, to sum up: what are the chief characteristics  which we have found to concern us in this sketch-map of the mental  life of man?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p109"></a>(1) We have divided that life, arbitrarily enough,  along the fluctuating line which psychologists call the  “threshold of his consciousness” into the surface life and  the unconscious deeps.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p110"></a>(2) In the surface life, though we recognized its  essential wholeness, we distinguished three outstanding and  ever-present aspects: the Trinity in Unity of feeling, thought, and  will. Amongst these we were obliged to give the primacy to feeling, as  the power which set the machinery of thought and will to work.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p111"></a>(3) We have seen that the expression of this life  takes the two complementary forms of   <i>conation,</i>    or outgoing action and   <i>cognition,</i>    or indwelling knowledge; and that the first, which is dynamic in  type, is largely the work of the will stimulated by the emotions;  whilst the second, which is passive in type, is the business of the  intellect. They answer to the two main aspects which man discerns in  the universal life: Being and Becoming.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p112"></a>(4) Neither conation nor cognition—action nor  thought—as performed by this surface mind, concerned as it is  with natural existence and dominated by spatial conceptions, is able  to set up any relations with the Absolute or transcendental world.  Such action and thought deal wholly with material supplied directly or  indirectly by the world of sense. The testimony of the mystics,  however, and of all persons possessing an “instinct for the  Absolute,” points to the existence of a further  faculty—indeed, a deeper self—in man; a self which the  circumstances of diurnal life usually keep “below the  threshold” of his consciousness, and which thus becomes one of  the factors of his “subliminal life.” This hidden self is  the primary agent of mysticism, and lives a “substantial”  life in touch with the real or transcendental world.   <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">109</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p114"></a>(5) Certain processes, of which contemplation has been  taken as a type, can so alter the state of consciousness as to permit  the emergence of this deeper self; which, according as it enters more  or less into the conscious life, makes man more or less a mystic.  <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_68"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p115"></a>The mystic life, therefore, involves the emergence  from deep levels of man’s transcendental self; its capture of  the field of consciousness; and the “conversion” or  rearrangement of his feeling, thought, and will—his  character—about this new centre of life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p116"></a>We state, then, as the conclusion of this chapter,  that the object of the mystic’s adventure, seen from within, is  the apprehension of, or direct communion with, that transcendental  Reality which we tried in the last section to define from without.  Here, as in the fulfilment of the highest earthly love, knowledge and  communion are the same thing; we must be “oned with bliss”  if we are to be aware of it. That aspect of our being by which we may  attain this communion—that “marrow of the Soul,” as  Ruysbroeck calls it—usually lies below the threshold of our  consciousness; but in certain natures of abnormal richness and  vitality, and under certain favourable conditions, it may be liberated  by various devices, such as contemplation. Once it has emerged,  however, it takes up, to help it in the work, aspects of the conscious  self. The surface must co-operate with the deeps, and at last merge  with those deeps to produce that unification of consciousness upon  high levels which alone can put a term to man’s unrest. The  heart that longs for the All, the mind that conceives it, the will  that concentrates the whole self upon it, must all be called into  play. The self must be surrendered: but it must not be annihilated, as  some Quietists have supposed. It only dies that it may live again.  Supreme success,—the permanent assurance of the mystic that  “we are more verily in heaven than in earth,”—says  the Lady Julian, in a passage which anticipates the classification of  modern psychology, “cometh of the natural Love of our soul, and  of the clear light of our Reason, and of the steadfast Mind.”   <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">110</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.iii-p118"></a>But what is the order of precedence which these three  activities are to assume in the work which is   <i>one</i>   ?All, as we have seen, must do their part; for we are concerned with  the response of man in his wholeness to the overwhelming attraction of  God. But which shall predominate? The ultimate nature of the  self’s experience of reality will depend on the answer she gives  to this question. What, here, are the relative values of Mind and  Heart? Which will bring her closest to the Thought of God; the real  life in which she is bathed? Which, fostered and made dominant, is  most likely to put her in harmony with the Absolute? The Love of God,  which is ever in the heart and often on the lips of the Saints, is the  passionate desire for this harmony; the “malady of  thought” is its intellectual equivalent. Though we may seem to  escape God, we cannot escape some form of this craving; except at the  price of utter stagnation. <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_69"></a> We go back,  therefore, to the statement with which this chapter opened: that of  the two governing desires which share the prison of the self. We see  them now as representing the cravings of the intellect and the  emotions for the only end of all quests. The disciplined  will—the “conative power”—with all the dormant  faculties which it can wake and utilize, can come to the assistance of  one of them. Which? The question is a crucial one, for the destiny of  the self depends on the partner which the will selects.</p>   <a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></a> <a name="an_iii.iii-Page_70"></a>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.iii-p42"></a>         <i>Note to the 12th Edition.</i>      During the eighteen years which have elapsed since this chapter was    written, much work has been done on the psychology of mysticism.    After suffering severely at the hands of the “new    psychologists” the contemplative faculty is once more taken    seriously; and there is even some disposition to accept or restate    the account of it given by the mystics. Thus Bremond    (“Prière et Poésie” and “Introduction    à la Philosophie de la Prière”) insists on the    capital distinction between the surface-mind, capable of rational    knowledge, and the deeper mind, organ of mystical knowledge, and    operative in varying degrees in religion poetic, and Esthetic    apprehensions.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.iii-p83"></a>         Boyce Gibson (“God with Us,” cap. iii.) has drawn a    striking parallel between the ferment and “interior    uproar” of adolescence and the profound disturbances which    mark man’s entry into a conscious spiritual life. His remarks    are even more applicable to the drastic rearrangement of personality    which takes place in the case of the mystic, whose spiritual life is    more intense than that of other men.</p>

It might reasonably be objected that    Madame Guyon does not rank high among the mystics and her later    history includes some unfortunate incidents. This is true.    Nevertheless she exhibit such a profusion of mystical phenomena and    is so candid in her self-disclosures, that she provides much    valuable material for the student.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.iii-p113"></a>         This insistence on the twofold character of human personality is    implicit in the mystics. “It is” says Bremond,    “the fundamental dogma of mystical psychology—the    distinction between the two selves:     <i>Animus,</i>      the surface self;     <i>Anima</i>     , the deep self;     <i>Animus</i>     , rational knowledge; and     <i>Anima</i>     , mystical or poetic knowledge . . . the I, who feeds on notions and    words, and enchants himself by doing so; the Me, who is united to    realities” (Bremond “Prière et Poésie,”    cap. xii.).</p>
