 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p1"></a>What<a name="an_iv.x-p1.1"></a> is the Unitive Life? We have referred to it often enough in the  course of this inquiry. At last we are face to face with the necessity  of defining its nature if we can. Since the normal man knows little  about his own true personality and nothing at all about that of Deity,  the orthodox description of it as “the life in which man’s  will is united with God,” does but echo the question in an  ampler form, and conveys no real meaning to the student’s  mind.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p2"></a>That we should know, by instinct, its character from  within—as we know, if we cannot express, the character of our  own normal human lives—is of course impossible. We deal here  with the final triumph of the spirit, the flower of mysticism,  humanity’s top note: the consummation towards which the  contemplative life, with its long slow growth and costly training, has  moved from the first. We look at a small but ever-growing group of  heroic figures, living at transcendent levels of reality which we  immersed in the poor life of illusion, cannot attain: breathing an  atmosphere whose true quality we cannot even conceive. Here, then, as  at so many other points in our study of the spiritual consciousness,  we must rely for the greater part of our knowledge upon the direct  testimony of the mystics; who alone can tell the character of that  “more abundant life” which they enjoy. <a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="green">p. 414</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_414"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p3"></a>Yet we are not wholly dependent on this source of  information. It is the peculiarity of the Unitive Life that it is  often lived, in its highest and most perfect forms, in the world; and  exhibits its works before the eyes of men. As the law of our bodies is  “earth to earth” so, strangely enough, is the law of our  souls. The spirit of man having at last come to full consciousness of  reality, completes the circle of Being; and returns to fertilize those  levels of existence from which it sprang. Hence, the enemies of  mysticism, who have easily drawn a congenial moral from the  “morbid and solitary” lives of contemplatives in the  earlier and educative stages of the Mystic Way, are here confronted  very often by the disagreeable spectacle of the mystic as a pioneer of  humanity, a sharply intuitive and painfully practical person: an  artist, a discoverer, a religious or social reformer, a national hero,  a “great active” amongst the saints. By the superhuman  nature of that which these persons accomplish, we can gauge something  of the super-normal vitality of which they partake. The things done,  the victories gained over circumstances by St. Bernard or St. Joan of  Arc, by St. Catherine of Siena, St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Teresa,  George Fox, are hardly to be explained unless these great spirits had  indeed a closer, more intimate, more bracing contact than their  fellows with that Life “which is the light of men.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p4"></a>Use have, then, these two lines of investigation open  to us: first, the comparison and elucidation of that which the mystics  tell us concerning their transcendent experience, secondly, the  testimony which is borne by their lives to the existence within them  of supernal springs of action, contact set up with deep levels of  vital power. In the third place, we have such critical machinery as  psychology has placed at our disposal; but this, in dealing with these  giants of the spirit, must be used with peculiar caution and  humility.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p5"></a>The Unitive Life, though so often lived in the world,  is never of it. It belongs to another plane of being, moves securely  upon levels unrelated to our speech; and hence eludes the measuring  powers of humanity. We, from the valley, can only catch a glimpse of  the true life of these elect spirits, transfigured upon the mountain.  They are far away, breathing another air: we cannot reach them. Yet it  is impossible to over-estimate their importance for the race. They are  our ambassadors to the Absolute. They vindicate humanity’s claim  to the possible and permanent attainment of Reality; bear witness to  the practical qualities of the transcendental life. In Eucken’s  words, they testify to “the advent of a triumphing Spiritual  Power, as distinguished from a spirituality which merely lays the  foundations of life or struggles to maintain <a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="green">p. 415</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_415"></a>  them”:   <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">842</font></a>
     to the actually life-enhancing power of the Love of God, once the  human soul is freely opened to receive it.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p7"></a>Coming first to the evidence of the mystics  themselves, we find that in their attempts towards describing the  Unitive Life they have recourse to two main forms of symbolic  expression, both very dangerous, and liable to be misunderstood, both  offering ample opportunity for harsh criticism to hostile  investigators of the mystic type. We find also, as we might expect  from our previous encounters with the symbols used by contemplatives  and ecstatics, that these two forms of expression belong respectively  to mystics of the transcendent-metaphysical and of the  intimate-personal type: and that their formulae if taken alone, appear  to contradict one another.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p8"></a>(1) The metaphysical mystic, for whom the Absolute is  impersonal and transcendent, describes his final attainment of that  Absolute as   <i>deification,</i>    or the utter transmutation of the self in God. (2) The mystic for  whom intimate and personal communion has been the mode under which he  best apprehended Reality speaks of the consummation of this communion,  its perfect and permanent form, as the   <i>Spiritual Marriage</i>    of his soul with God. Obviously, both these terms are but the  self’s guesses concerning the intrinsic character of a state  which it has felt in its wholeness rather than analysed: and bear the  same relation to the ineffable realities of that state, as our clever  theories concerning the nature and meaning of life bear to the vital  processes of men. It is worth while to examine them but we shall not  understand them till we have also examined the life which they profess  to explain.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p9"></a>The language of “deification” and of  “spiritual marriage,” then, is temperamental language: and  is related to subjective experience rather than to objective fact. It  describes on the one hand the mystic’s astonished recognition of  a profound change effected in his own personality   <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">843</font></a>
    —the transmutation of his salt, sulphur, and mercury into  Spiritual Gold—on the other, the rapturous consummation of his  love. Hence by a comparison of these symbolic reconstructions, by the  discovery and isolation of the common factor latent in each, we may  perhaps learn something of the fundamental fact which each is trying  to portray.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p15"></a>Again, the mystics describe certain symptoms either as  the <a name="page_416"><font size="1" color="green">p. 416</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_416"></a> necessary preliminaries or as the marks and  fruits of the Unitive State: and these too may help us to fix its  character.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p16"></a>The chief, in fact the one essential, preliminary is  that pure surrender of selfhood, or “self-naughting,”  which the trials of the Dark Night tended to produce.  “This,” says Julian of Norwich, “is the cause why  that no soul is rested till it is naughted of all things that are  made. When it is willingly made naught for love to have Him that is  all, then is it able to receive spiritual rest.”   <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">844</font></a>
     Only the thoroughly detached, “naughted soul” is  “free,” says “The Mirror of Simple Souls,” and  the Unitive State is essentially a state of free and filial  participation in Eternal Life. The capital marks of the state itself  are (1) a complete absorption in the interests of the Infinite, under  whatever mode It is apprehended by the self; (2) a consciousness of  sharing Its strength, acting by Its authority, which results in a  complete sense of freedom, an invulnerable serenity, and usually urges  the self to some form of heroic effort or creative activity; (3) the  establishment of the self as a “power for life,” a centre  of energy, an actual parent of spiritual vitality in other men. By  assembling these symptoms and examining them, and the lives of those  who exhibit them, in the light of psychology, we can surely get some  news—however fragmentary—concerning the transcendent  condition of being which involves these characteristic states and  acts. Beyond this even Dante himself could not go:</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.x-p17.1"></a> ‘Transumanar significar   <i>per verba</i>  <br>   non si poria.”   <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">845</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p19"></a>We will then consider the Unitive Life (1) As it  appears from the standpoint of the psychologist. (2) As it is  described to us by those mystics who use (a) the language of  Deification, (b) that of Spiritual Marriage. (3) Finally, we will turn  to those who have lived it; and try, if we can, to realize it as an  organic whole.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p20"></a>(1) From the point of view of the pure psychologist,  what do the varied phenomena of the Unitive Life, taken together, seem  to represent? He would probably say that they indicate the final and  successful establishment of that higher form of consciousness which  has been struggling for supremacy during the whole of the Mystic Way.  The deepest, richest levels of human personality have now attained to  light and freedom. The self is remade, transformed, has at last  unified itself; and with the cessation of stress, power has been  liberated for new purposes.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p21"></a>“The beginning of the mystic life,” says  Delacroix, “introduced into the personal life of the subject a  group of states which are distinguished by certain characteristics,  and which form, so to <a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="green">p. 417</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_417"></a> speak, a special  psychological system. At its term, it has, as it were, suppressed the  ordinary self, and by the development of this system has established a  new personality with a new method of feeling and of action. Its growth  results in the transformation of personality: it abolishes the  primitive consciousness of selfhood, and substitutes for it a wider  consciousness, the total disappearance of selfhood in the divine, the  substitution of a Divine Self for the primitive self.”   <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">846</font></a>
     We give a philosophic content to this conception if we say further  that man, in this Unitive State, by this substitution of the divine  for the “primitive” self, has at last risen to true  freedom; “entered on the fruition of reality.”   <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">847</font></a>
     Hence he has opened up new paths for the inflow of that Triumphing  Power which is the very substance of the Real; has remade his  consciousness, and in virtue of this total regeneration is  “transplanted into that Universal Life, which is yet not alien  but our own.”   <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_847"><font size="1">848</font></a>
     From contact set up with this Universal Life, this “Energetic  Word of God, which nothing can contain”—from those deep  levels of Being to which his shifting, growing personality is fully  adapted at last—he draws that amazing strength, that immovable  peace, that power of dealing with circumstance, which is one of the  most marked characteristics of the Unitive Life. “That secret  and permanent personality of a superior type”   <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_848"><font size="1">849</font></a>
     which gave to the surface-self constant and ever more insistent  intimations of its existence at every stage of the mystic’s  growth—his real, eternal self—has now consciously realized  its destiny: and begins at last fully to   <i>be.</i>    In the travail of the Dark Night it has conquered and invaded the  last recalcitrant elements of character. It is no more limited to acts  of profound perception, overpowering intuitions of the Absolute: no  more dependent for its emergence on the psychic states of  contemplation and ecstasy.   <i>Anima</i>    and   <i>Animus</i>    are united. The mystic has at last resolved the Stevensonian paradox;  and is not truly two, but truly   <i>one.</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p26"></a>(2) The mystic, I think, would acquiesce in these  descriptions, so far as they go: but he would probably translate them  into his own words and gloss them with an explanation which is beyond  the power and province of psychology. He would say that his  long-sought correspondence with Transcendental Reality, his union with  God, has now been finally established: that his self, though intact,  is wholly penetrated—as a sponge by the sea—by the Ocean  of Life and Love to which he has attained. “I live, yet not I  but God in me.” He is conscious that he is now at length  cleansed <a name="page_418"><font size="1" color="green">p. 418</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_418"></a> of the last stains of separation, and has  become, in a mysterious manner, “that which he  beholds.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p27"></a>In the words of the Sufi poet, the mystic’s  journey is now prosecuted not only   <i>to</i>    God but   <i>in</i>    God. He has entered the Eternal Order, attained here and now the  state to which the Magnet of the Universe draws every living thing.  Moving through periods of alternate joy and anguish, as his spiritual  self woke, stretched, and was tested in the complementary fires of  love and pain, he was inwardly conscious that he moved towards a  definite objective. In so far as he was a great mystic, he was also  conscious that this objective was no mere act of knowing, however  intense, exultant, and sublime, but a condition of being, fulfilment  of that love which impelled him, steadily and inexorably, to his own  place. In the image of the alchemists, the Fire of Love has done its  work: the mystic Mercury of the Wise—that little hidden  treasure, that scrap of Reality within him—has utterly  transmuted the salt and sulphur of his mind and his sense. Even the  white stone of illumination, once so dearly cherished, he has resigned  to the crucible. Now, the great work is accomplished, the last  imperfection is gone, and he finds within himself the “Noble  Tincture”—the gold of spiritual humanity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p28"></a>(A) We have said that the mystic of the impersonal  type—the seeker of a Transcendent Absolute—tends to  describe the consummation of his quest in the language of   <i>deification.</i>    The Unitive Life necessarily means for him, as for all who attain it,  something which infinitely transcends the sum total of its symptoms:  something which normal men cannot hope to understand. In it he  declares that he “partakes directly of the Divine Nature,”  enjoys the fruition of reality. Since we “only behold that which  we are,” the doctrine of deification results naturally and  logically from this claim.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p29"></a>“Some may ask,” says the author of the  “Theologia Germanica” “what is it to be a partaker  of the Divine Nature, or a Godlike [<a name="an_iv.x-p29.1"></a>   <i>vergottet</i>     <i>,</i>    literally deified] man? Answer: he who is imbued with or illuminated  by the Eternal or Divine Light and inflamed or consumed with Eternal  or Divine Love, he is a deified man and a partaker of the Divine  Nature.”   <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_849"><font size="1">850</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p31"></a>Such a word as “deification” is not, of  course, a scientific term. It is a metaphor, an artistic expression  which tries to hint at a transcendent fact utterly beyond the powers  of human understanding, and therefore without equivalent in human  speech: that fact of which Dante perceived the “shadowy  preface” when he saw the saints as petals of the Sempiternal  Rose.   <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_850"><font size="1">851</font></a>
     Since we know not <a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="green">p. 419</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_419"></a> the Being of God, the mere  statement that a soul is transformed in Him may convey to us an  ecstatic suggestion, but will never give exact information: except of  course to those rare selves who have experienced these supernal  states. Such selves, however—or a large proportion of  them—accept this statement as approximately true. Whilst the  more clear-sighted are careful to qualify it in a sense which excludes  pantheistic interpretations, and rebuts the accusation that extreme  mystics preach the annihilation of the self and regard themselves as  co-equal with the Deity, they leave us in no doubt that it answers to  a definite and normal experience of many souls who attain high levels  of spiritual vitality. Its terms are chiefly used by those mystics by  whom Reality is apprehended as a state or place rather than a Person:   <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_851"><font size="1">852</font></a>
     and who have adopted, in describing the earlier stages of their  journey to God, such symbols as those of rebirth or transmutation.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p34"></a>The blunt and positive language of these  contemplatives concerning deification has aroused more enmity amongst  the unmystical than any other of their doctrines or practices. It is  of course easy, by confining oneself to its surface sense, to call  such language blasphemous: and the temptation to do so has seldom been  resisted. Yet, rightly understood, this doctrine lies at the heart,  not only of all mysticism, but also of much philosophy and most  religion. It pushes their first principles to a logical end. Christian  mysticism, says Delacroix with justice, springs from “that  spontaneous and half-savage longing for deification which all religion  contains.”   <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_852"><font size="1">853</font></a>
     Eastern Christianity has always accepted it and expressed it in her  rites. “The Body of God deifies me and feeds me,” says  Simeon Metaphrastes, “it deifies my spirit and it feeds my soul  in an incomprehensible manner.”   <a name="fr_853"></a><a href="#fn_853"><font size="1">854</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p37"></a>The Christian mystics justify this dogma of the  deifying of man, by exhibiting it as the necessary corollary of the  Incarnation—the humanizing of God. They can quote the authority  of the Fathers in support of this argument. “He became man that  we might be made God,” says St. Athanasius.   <a name="fr_854"></a><a href="#fn_854"><font size="1">855</font></a>
     “I heard,” says St. Augustine, speaking of his  pre-converted period, “Thy voice from on high crying unto me,  ‘I am the Food of the fullgrown: grow, and then thou shalt feed  on Me. Nor shalt thou change Me into thy substance as thou changest  the food of thy flesh, but thou shalt be changed into  Mine.’”   <a name="fr_855"></a><a href="#fn_855"><font size="1">856</font></a>
     Eckhart therefore did no more than expand the patristic view when he  wrote, “Our Lord says to every living <a name="page_420"><font size="1" color="green">p. 420</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_420"></a> soul,  ‘I became man for you. If you do not become God for me, you do  me wrong.’”   <a name="fr_856"></a><a href="#fn_856"><font size="1">857</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p41"></a>If we are to allow that the mystics have ever attained  the object of their quest, I think we must also allow that such  attainment involves the transmutation of the self to that state which  they call, for want of exact language, “deified.” The  necessity of such transmutation is an implicit of their first  position: the law that “we behold that which we are, and are  that which we behold.” Eckhart, in whom the language of  deification assumes its most extreme form, justifies it upon this  necessity. “If,” he says, “I am to know God  directly, I must become completely He and He I: so that this He and  this I become and are one I.”   <a name="fr_857"></a><a href="#fn_857"><font size="1">858</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p43"></a>God, said St. Augustine, is the Country of the soul:  its Home, says Ruysbroeck. The mystic in the unitive state is living  in and of his native land; no exploring alien, but a returned exile,  now wholly identified with it, part of it, yet retaining his  personality intact. As none know the spirit of England but the  English; and they know it by intuitive participation, by mergence, not  by thought; so none but the “deified” know the secret life  of God. This, too, is a knowledge conferred only by participation: by  living a life, breathing an atmosphere, “union with that same  Light by which they see, and which they see.”   <a name="fr_858"></a><a href="#fn_858"><font size="1">859</font></a>
     It is one of those rights of citizenship which cannot be artificially  conferred. Thus it becomes important to ask the mystics what they have  to tell us of their life lived upon the bosom of Reality: and to  receive their reports without prejudice, however hard the sayings they  contain.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p45"></a>The first thing which emerges from these reports, and  from the choice of symbols which we find in them, is that the great  mystics are anxious above all things to establish and force on us the  truth that by   <i>deification</i>    they intend no arrogant claim to identification with God, but as it  were a transfusion of their selves by His Self: an entrance upon a new  order of life, so high and so harmonious with Reality that it can only  be called divine. Over and over again they assure us that personality  is not lost, but made more real. “When,” says St.  Augustine, “I shall cleave to Thee with all my being, then shall  I in nothing have pain and labour; and my   <i>life shall be a real life,</i>    being wholly full of Thee.”   <a name="fr_859"></a><a href="#fn_859"><font size="1">860</font></a>
     “My life shall be a real life” because it is “full  of Thee.” The achievement of reality, and deification, are then  one and the same thing: necessarily so, since we know that only the  divine is the real.   <a name="fr_860"></a><a href="#fn_860"><font size="1">861</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p48"></a>Mechthild of Magdeburg, and after her Dante, saw Deity  as a <a name="page_421"><font size="1" color="green">p. 421</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_421"></a> flame or river of fire that filled the  Universe, and the “deified” souls of the saints as ardent  sparks therein, ablaze with that fire, one thing with it, yet  distinct.   <a name="fr_861"></a><a href="#fn_861"><font size="1">862</font></a>
     Ruysbroeck, too, saw “Every soul like a live coal, burned up by  God on the heart of His Infinite Love.”   <a name="fr_862"></a><a href="#fn_862"><font size="1">863</font></a>
     Such fire imagery has seemed to many of the mystics a peculiarly  exact and suggestive symbol of the transcendent state which they are  struggling to describe. No longer confused by the dim Cloud of  Unknowing, they have pierced to its heart, and there found their goal:  that uncreated and energizing Fire which guided the children of Israel  through the night. By a deliberate appeal to the parallel of such  great impersonal forces—to Fire and Heat, Light, Water,  Air—mystic writers seem able to bring out a perceived aspect of  the Godhead, and of the transfigured soul’s participation  therein, which no merely personal language, taken alone, can touch.  Thus Boehme, trying to describe the union between the Word and the  soul, says, “I give you an earthly similitude of this. Behold a  bright flaming piece of iron, which of itself is dark and black, and  the fire so penetrateth and shineth through the iron, that it giveth  light. Now, the iron doth not   <i>cease to be,</i>    it is iron still: and the source (or property) of the fire retaineth  its own propriety: it doth not take the iron into it, but it  penetrateth (and shineth) through the iron; and it is iron then as  well as before,   <i>free</i>    in itself: and so also is the source or property of the   <i>fire.</i>    In such a manner is the soul set in the Deity; the Deity penetrateth  through the soul, and dwelleth in the soul, yet the soul doth not  comprehend the Deity, but the Deity comprehendeth the soul, but doth  not alter it (from being a soul) but only giveth it the divine source  (or property) of the Majesty.”   <a name="fr_863"></a><a href="#fn_863"><font size="1">864</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p52"></a>Almost exactly the same image of deification was used,  five hundred years before Boehme’s day, by Richard of St.  Victor; a mystic whom he is hardly likely to have read. “When  the soul is plunged in the fire of divine love,” he says,  “like iron, it first loses its blackness, and then growing to  white heat, it becomes like unto the fire itself. And lastly, it grows  liquid, and losing its nature is transmuted into an utterly different  quality of being.” “As the difference between iron that is  cold and iron that is hot,” he says again, “so is the  difference between soul and soul: between the tepid soul and the soul  made incandescent by divine love.”   <a name="fr_864"></a><a href="#fn_864"><font size="1">865</font></a>
    Other contemplatives say that the deified soul is transfigured by the  inundations of the Uncreated Light: that it is like a brand blazing in  the furnace, transformed to the likeness of the fire. “These  souls,” says the Divine voice to St. Catherine of Siena, <a name="page_422"><font size="1" color="green">p. 422</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_422"></a> “thrown into the furnace of My charity, no part of  their will remaining outside but the whole of them being inflamed in  Me, are like a brand, wholly consumed in the furnace, so that no one  can take hold of it to extinguish it, because it has become fire. In  the same way no one can seize these souls, or draw them outside of Me,  because they are made   <i>one thing</i>    with Me through grace, and I never withdraw Myself from them by  sentiment, as in the case of those whom I am leading on to  perfection.”   <a name="fr_865"></a><a href="#fn_865"><font size="1">866</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p55"></a>For the most subtle and delicate descriptions of the  Unitive or Deified State, understood as self-loss in the “Ocean  Pacific” of God, we must go to the great genius of Ruysbroeck.  He alone, whilst avoiding all its pitfalls, has conveyed the  suggestion of its ineffable joys in a measure which seems, as we read,  to be beyond all that we had supposed possible to human utterance. Awe  and rapture, theological profundity, keen psychological insight, are  here tempered by a touching simplicity. We listen to the report of one  who has indeed heard “the invitation of love” which  “draws interior souls towards the One” and says  “Come home.” A humble receptivity, a meek self-naughting  is with Ruysbroeck, as with all great mystics, the gate of the City of  God. “Because they have abandoned themselves to God in doing, in  leaving undone, and in suffering,” he says of the deified souls,  “they have steadfast peace and inward joy, consolation and  savour, of which the world cannot partake; neither any dissembler, nor  the man who seeks and means himself more than the glory of God.  Moreover, those same inward and enlightened men have before them in  their inward seeing, whenever they will, the Love of God as something  drawing or urging them into the Unity; for they see and feel that the  Father with the Son through the Holy Ghost, embrace Each Other and all  the chosen, and draw themselves back with eternal love into the unity  of Their Nature. Thus the Unity is ever drawing to itself and inviting  to itself everything that has been born of It, either by nature or by  grace. And therefore, too, such enlightened men are, with a free  spirit, lifted up above reason into a bare and imageless vision,  wherein lives the eternal indrawing summons of the Divine Unity; and,  with an imageless and bare understanding, they pass through all works,  and all exercises, and all things, until they reach the summit of  their spirits. There, their bare understanding is drenched through by  the Eternal Brightness, even as the air is drenched through by the  sunshine. And the bare, uplifted will is transformed and drenched  through by abysmal love, even as iron is by fire. And the bare,  uplifted memory feels itself enwrapped and established in an abysmal  Absence of Image. And thereby the created image <a name="page_423"><font size="1" color="green">p. 423</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_423"></a> is  united above reason in a threefold way with its Eternal Image, which  is the origin of its being and its life. . . . Yet the creature does  not become God, for the union takes place in God through grace and our  homeward-turning love: and therefore the creature in its inward  contemplation feels a distinction and an otherness between itself and  God. And though the union is without means, yet the manifold works  which God works in heaven and on earth are nevertheless hidden from  the spirit. For though God gives Himself as He is, with clear  discernment, He gives Himself in the essence of the soul, where the  powers of the soul are simplified above reason, and where, in  simplicity, they suffer the transformation of God. There all is full  and overflowing, for the spirit feels itself to be one truth and one  richness and one unity with God. Yet even here there is an essential  tending forward, and therein is an essential distinction between the  being of the soul and the Being of God; and this is the highest and  finest distinction which we are able to feel.”   <a name="fr_866"></a><a href="#fn_866"><font size="1">867</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p57"></a>“When love has carried us above and beyond all  things,” he says in another place, “above the light, into  the Divine Dark, there we are wrought and transformed by the Eternal  Word Who is the image of the Father; and as the air is penetrated by  the sun, thus we receive in idleness of spirit the Incomprehensible  Light, enfolding us and penetrating us. And this flight is nothing  else but an infinite gazing and seeing. We behold that which we are,  and we are that which be behold; because our thought, life and being  are uplifted in simplicity and made one with the Truth which is  God.”   <a name="fr_867"></a><a href="#fn_867"><font size="1">868</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p59"></a>Here the personal aspect of the Absolute seems to be  reduced to a minimum: yet all that we value in personality—love,  action, will—remains unimpaired. We seem caught up to a plane of  vision beyond the categories of the human mind: to the contemplation  of a Something Other—our home, our hope, and our passion, the  completion of our personality, and the Substance of all that Is. Such  an endless contemplation, such a dwelling within the substance of  Goodness, Truth and, Beauty, is the essence of that Beatific Vision,  that participation of Eternity, “of all things most delightful  and desired, of all things most loved by them who have it,”   <a name="fr_868"></a><a href="#fn_868"><font size="1">869</font></a>
     which theology presents to us as the objective of the soul.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p61"></a>Those mystics of the metaphysical type who tend to use  these impersonal symbols of Place and Thing often see in the Unitive  Life a foretaste of the Beatific Vision: an entrance here and now  <a name="page_424"><font size="1" color="green">p. 424</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_424"></a> into that absolute life within the Divine Being,  which shall be lived by all perfect spirits when they have cast off  the limitations of the flesh and re-entered the eternal order for  which they were made. For them, in fact, the “deified  man,” in virtue of his genius for transcendental reality, has  run ahead of human history: and attained a form of consciousness which  other men will only know when earthly life is past.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p62"></a>In the “Book of Truth” Suso has a  beautiful and poetic comparison between the life of the blessed  spirits dwelling within the Ocean of Divine Love, and that approximate  life which is lived on earth by the mystic who has renounced all  selfhood and merged his will in that of the Eternal Truth. Here we  find one of the best of many answers to the ancient but apparently  immortal accusation that the mystics teach the total annihilation of  personality as the end and object of their quest. “Lord, tell  me,” says the Servitor, “what remains to a blessed soul  which has wholly renounced itself.” Truth says, “When the  good and faithful servant enters into the joy of his Lord, he is  inebriated by the riches of the house of God; for he feels, in an  ineffable degree, that which is felt by an inebriated man. He forgets  himself, he is no longer conscious of his selfhood; he disappears and  loses himself in God, and becomes one spirit with Him, as a drop of  water which is drowned in a great quantity of wine. For even as such a  drop disappears, taking the colour and the taste of wine, so it is  with those who are in full possession of blessedness. All human  desires are taken from them in an indescribable manner, they are rapt  from themselves, and are immersed in the Divine Will. If it were  otherwise, if there remained in the man some human thing that was not  absorbed, those words of Scripture which say that God must be all in  all would be false.   <i>His being remains, but in another form, in another glory, and in  another power.</i>    And all this is the result of entire and complete renunciation. . . .  Herein thou shalt find an answer to thy question; for the true  renunciation and veritable abandonment of a man to the Divine Will in  the temporal world is an imitation and reduction of that  self-abandonment of the blessed, of which Scripture speaks: and this  imitation approaches its model more or less, according as men are more  or less united with God and become more or less one with God. Remark  well that which is said of the blessed: they are stripped of their  personal initiative, and changed into another form, another glory,  another power. What then is this other form, if it be not the Divine  Nature and the Divine Being whereinto they pour themselves, and which  pours Itself into them, and becomes one thing with them? And what is  that other glory, if it be not to be illuminated and made shining in  the Inaccessible Light? What is <a name="page_425"><font size="1" color="green">p. 425</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_425"></a> that other power,  if it be not that by means of his union with the Divine Personality,  there is given to man a divine strength and a divine power, that he  may accomplish all which pertains to his blessedness and omit all  which is contrary thereto? And thus it is that, as has been said, a  man comes forth from his selfhood.”   <a name="fr_869"></a><a href="#fn_869"><font size="1">870</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p64"></a>All the mystics agree that the stripping off of the I,  the Me, the Mine, utter renouncement, or  “self-naughting”—self-abandonment to the direction  of a larger Will—is an imperative condition of the attainment of  the unitive life. The temporary denudation of the mind, whereby the  contemplative made space for the vision of God, must now be applied to  the whole life. Here, they say, there is a final swallowing up of that  wilful I-hood, that surface individuality which we ordinarily  recognize as ourselves. It goes for ever, and something new is  established in its room. The self is made part of the mystical Body of  God; and, humbly taking its place in the corporate life of Reality,  would “fain be to the Eternal Goodness what his own hand is to a  man.”   <a name="fr_870"></a><a href="#fn_870"><font size="1">871</font></a>
     That strange “hunger and thirst of God for the soul,”  “at once avid and generous,” of which they speak in their  profoundest passages, here makes its final demand and receives its  satisfaction. “All that He has, all that He is He gives: all  that we have, all that we are, He takes.”   <a name="fr_871"></a><a href="#fn_871"><font size="1">872</font></a>
     The self, they declare, is devoured, immersed in the Abyss;  “sinks into God, Who is the deep of deeps.” In their  efforts towards describing to us this, the supreme mystic act, and the  new life to which it gives birth, they are often driven to the use of  images which must seem to us grotesque, were it not for the flame  which burns behind: as when Ruysbroeck cries, “To eat and be  eaten! this is Union! . . . Since His desire is without measure, to be  devour of of Him does not greatly amaze me.”   <a name="fr_872"></a><a href="#fn_872"><font size="1">873</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p68"></a>(B) At this point we begin to see that the language of  deification, taken alone, will not suffice to describe the  soul’s final experience of Reality. The personal and emotional  aspect of man’s relation with his Source is also needed if that  which he means by “union with God” is to be even partially  expressed. Hence, even the most “transcendental” mystic is  constantly compelled to fall back on the language of love in the  endeavour to express the content of his metaphysical raptures: and  forced in the end to acknowledge that the perfect union of Lover and  Beloved cannot be suggested in the precise and arid terms of religious  philosophy. Such arid language eludes the most dangerous aspects of  “divine union,” the pantheistic on one hand, the  “amoristic” on the other; but it also fails to express the  most splendid side of that amazing <a name="page_426"><font size="1" color="green">p. 426</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_426"></a> experience. It  needs some other, more personal and intimate vision to complete it:  and this we shall find in the reports of those mystics of the  “intimate” type to whom the Unitive Life has meant not  self-loss in an Essence, but self-fulfilment in the union of heart and  will.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p69"></a>The extreme form of this kind of apprehension of  course finds expression in the well-known and heartily abused  symbolism of the Spiritual Marriage between God and the Soul: a  symbolism which goes back to the Orphic Mysteries, and thence  descended via the Neoplatonists into the stream of Christian  tradition. But there are other and less concrete embodiments of it,  wholly free from the dangers which are supposed to lurk in  “erotic” imagery of this kind. Thus Jalalu ‘d Din,  by the use of metaphors which are hardly human yet charged with  passionate feeling, tells, no less successfully than the writer of the  Song of Songs, the secret of “his union in which “heart  speaks to heart.”</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.x-p69.1"></a> With Thy Sweet Soul, this soul of mine<br>   Hath mixed as Water doth with Wine.<br>   Who can the Wine and Water part,<br>   Or me and Thee when we combine?<br>   Thou art become my greater self;<br>   Small bounds no more can me confine.<br>   Thou hast my being taken on,<br>   And shall not I now take on Thine?<br>   Me Thou for ever hast affirmed<br>   That I may ever know Thee mine<br>   Thy Love has pierced me through and through,<br>   Its thrill with Bone and Nerve entwine.<br>   I rest a Flute laid on Thy lips;<br>   A lute, I on Thy breast recline.<br>   Breathe deep in me that I may sigh;<br>   Yet strike my strings, and tears shall shine.”   <a name="fr_873"></a><a href="#fn_873"><font size="1">874</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p71"></a>What the mystic here desires to tell us is, that his  new life is not only a free and conscious participation in the life of  Eternity—a fully-established existence on real and  transcendental levels—but also the conscious sharing of an  inflowing   <i>personal life</i>    greater than his own; a tightening of the bonds of that companionship  which has been growing in intimacy and splendour during the course of  the Mystic Way. This companionship, at once the most actual and most  elusive fact of human experience, is utterly beyond the resources of  speech. So too are those mysteries of the communion of love, whereby  the soul’s humble, active and ever-renewed self-donation becomes  the occasion of her glory: and “by her love she is made the  equal of Love”—the beggar maid sharing Cophetua’s  throne.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p72"></a>Thus the anonymous author of the “Mirror”  writes, in one of <a name="page_427"><font size="1" color="green">p. 427</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_427"></a> his most daring passages,  “‘I am God,’ says Love, ‘for Love is God, and  God is Love. And this soul is God by condition of love: but I am God  by Nature Divine. And this [state] is hers by righteousness of love,  so that this precious beloved of me is learned, and led of Me without  her [working]. . . . This [soul] is the eagle that flies high, so  right high and yet more high than doth any other bird; for she is  feathered with fine love.’”   <a name="fr_874"></a><a href="#fn_874"><font size="1">875</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p74"></a>The simplest expression of the Unitive Life, the  simplest interpretation which we can put on its declarations, is that  it is the complete and conscious fulfilment here and now of this  Perfect Love. In it certain elect spirits, still in the flesh,  “fly high and yet more high,” till “taught and led  out of themselves,” they become, in the exaggerated language of  the “Mirror,” “God by condition of love.”  Home-grown English mysticism tried as a rule to express the  inexpressible in homelier, more temperate terms than this. “I  would that thou knew,” says the unknown author of the  “Epistle of Prayer,” “what manner of working it is  that knitteth man’s soul to God, and that maketh it one with Him  in love and accordance of will after the word of St. Paul, saying  thus: <a name="an_iv.x-p74.1"></a>‘  <i>Qui</i>      <i>adhaeret Deo, unus spiritus est cum illo</i>   ’  <i>;</i>    that is to say: ‘Whoso draweth near to God as it is by such a  reverent affection touched before, he is one spirit with God.’  That is, though all that God and he be two and sere in kind,  nevertheless yet in grace they are so knit together that they are but  one in spirit; and all this is one for onehead of love and accordance  of will; and in this onehead is the marriage made between God and the  soul the which shall never be broken, though all that the heat and the  fervour of this work cease for a time, but by a deadly sin. In the  ghostly feeling of this onehead may a loving soul both say and sing  (if it list) this holy word that is written in the Book of Songs in  the Bible, <a name="an_iv.x-p74.2"></a>  <i>‘Dilectus meus mihi et ego illi,</i>     <i>’</i>    that is, My loved unto me, and I unto Him; understanding that God  shall be knitted with the ghostly glue of grace on His party, and the  lovely consent in gladness of spirit on thy party.”   <a name="fr_875"></a><a href="#fn_875"><font size="1">876</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p76"></a>I think no one can deny that the comparison of the  bond between the soul and the Absolute to “ghostly glue,”  though crude, is wholly innocent. Its appearance in this passage as an  alternative to the symbol of wedlock may well check the uncritical  enthusiasm of those who hurry to condemn at sight all  “sexual” imagery. That it has seemed to the mystics  appropriate and exact is proved by its reappearance in the next  century in the work of a greater contemplative. “Thou givest  me,” says Petersen, <a name="page_428"><font size="1" color="green">p. 428</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_428"></a> “Thy whole Self to  be mine whole and undivided, if at least I shall be Thine whole and  undivided. And when I shall be thus all Thine, even as from  everlasting Thou hast loved Thyself, so from everlasting Thou hast  loved me: for this means nothing more than that Thou enjoyest Thyself  in me, and that I by Thy grace enjoy Thee in myself and myself in  Thee. And when in Thee I shall love myself, nothing else but Thee do I  love, because   <i>Thou art in me and I in Thee, glued together as one and the  selfsame thing,</i>    which henceforth and forever cannot be divided.”   <a name="fr_876"></a><a href="#fn_876"><font size="1">877</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p78"></a>From this kind of language to that of the Spiritual  Marriage, as understood by the pure minds of the mystics, is but a  step.   <a name="fr_877"></a><a href="#fn_877"><font size="1">878</font></a>
     They mean by it no rapturous satisfactions, no dubious spiritualizing  of earthly ecstasies, but a life-long bond “that shall never be  lost or broken,” a close personal union of will and of heart  between the free self and that “Fairest in Beauty” Whom it  has known in the act of contemplation.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p80"></a>The Mystic Way has been a progress, a growth in love:  a deliberate fostering of the inward tendency of the soul towards its  source, an eradication of its disorderly tendencies to “temporal  goods.” But the only proper end of love is union: “a  perfect uniting and coupling together of the lover and the loved into  one.”   <a name="fr_878"></a><a href="#fn_878"><font size="1">879</font></a>
     It is “a unifying principle,” the philosophers say:   <a name="fr_879"></a><a href="#fn_879"><font size="1">880</font></a>
     life’s mightiest agent upon every plane. Moreover, just as  earthly marriage is understood by the moral sense less as a  satisfaction of personal desire, than as a part of the great process  of life—the fusion of two selves for new purposes—so such  spiritual marriage brings with it duties and obligations. With the  attainment of a new order, the new infusion of vitality, comes a new  responsibility, the call to effort and endurance on a new and mighty  scale. It is not an act but a state. Fresh life is imparted, by which  our lives are made complete: new creative powers are conferred. The  self, lifted to the divine order, is to be an agent of the divine  fecundity: an energizing centre, a parent of transcendental life.  “The last perfection,” says Aquinas, “to supervene  upon a thing, is its becoming the cause of other things. While then a  creature tends by many ways to the likeness of God, the last way left  open to it is to seek the divine likeness by being the cause of other  things, according to what the Apostle says, <a name="an_iv.x-p82.1"></a>    <i>Dei enim sumus adjutores</i>     <i>.”</i>    <a name="fr_880"></a><a href="#fn_880"><font size="1">881</font></a>
     <a name="page_429"><font size="1" color="green">p. 429</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_429"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p84"></a>We find as a matter of fact, when we come to study the  history of the mystics, that the permanent Unitive State, or spiritual  marriage, does mean for those who attain to it, above all else such an  access of creative vitality. It means man’s small derivative  life invaded and enhanced by the Absolute Life: the appearance in  human history of personalities and careers which seem superhuman when  judged by the surface mind. Such activity, such a bringing forth of  “the fruits of the Spirit,” may take many forms: but where  it is absent, where we meet with personal satisfactions, personal  visions or raptures—however sublime and  spiritualized—presented as marks of the Unitive Way, ends or  objects of the quest of Reality, we may be sure that we have wandered  from the “strait and narrow road” which leads, not to  eternal rest, but to Eternal Life. “The fourth degree of love is  spiritually fruitful,”   <a name="fr_881"></a><a href="#fn_881"><font size="1">882</font></a>
     said Richard of St. Victor. Wherever we find a sterile love, a  “holy passivity,” we are in the presence of quietistic  heresy; not of the Unitive Life. “I hold it for a certain  truth,” says St. Teresa, “that in giving these graces our  Lord intends, as I have often told you, to strengthen our weakness so  that we may imitate Him by suffering much. . . . Whence did St. Paul  draw strength to support his immense labours? We see clearly in him  the effects of visions and contemplations which come indeed from our  Lord, and not from our own imagination or the devil’s fraud. Do  you suppose St. Paul hid himself in order to enjoy in peace these  spiritual consolations, and did nothing else? You know that on the  contrary he never took a day’s rest so far as we can learn, and  worked at night in order to earn his bread. . . . Oh my sisters! how  forgetful of her own ease, how careless of honours, should she be  whose soul God thus chooses for His special dwelling place! For if her  mind is fixed on Him, as it ought to be, she must needs forget  herself; all her thoughts are bent on how to please Him better, and  when and how she may show Him her love.   <i>This</i>    is the end and aim of prayer, my daughters;   <i>this</i>    is the object of that spiritual marriage whose children are always  good works.   <i>Works</i>    are the best proof that the favours which we receive have come from  God.”   <a name="fr_882"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">883</font></a>
     “To give our Lord a perfect hospitality” she says in the  same chapter, “Mary and Martha must combine.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p87"></a>When we look at the lives of the great theopathetic  mystics, the true initiates of Eternity—inarticulate as these  mystics often are—we find ourselves in the presence of an  amazing, a superabundant vitality: of a “triumphing force”  over which circumstance has no power. The incessant production of good  works seems indeed <a name="page_430"><font size="1" color="green">p. 430</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_430"></a> to be the object of that Spirit,  by Whose presence their interior castle is now filled.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p88"></a>We see St. Paul, abruptly enslaved by the First and  Only Fair, not hiding himself to enjoy the vision of Reality, but  going out single-handed to organize the Catholic Church. We ask how it  was possible for an obscure Roman citizen, without money, influence,  or good health, to lay these colossal foundations: and he answers  “Not I, but Christ in me.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p89"></a>We see St. Joan of Arc, a child of the peasant class,  leaving the sheepfold to lead the armies of France. We ask how this  incredible thing can be: and are told “Her Voices bade  her.” A message, an overpowering impulse, came from the  supra-sensible: vitality flowed in on her, she knew not how or why.  She was united with the Infinite Life, and became Its agent, the  medium of Its strength, “what his own hand is to a  man.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p90"></a>We see St. Francis, “God’s  troubadour,” marked with His wounds, inflamed with His  joy—obverse and reverse of the earnest-money of  eternity—or St. Ignatius Loyola, our Lady’s knight, a  figure at once militant and romantic, go out to change the spiritual  history of Europe. Where did they find—born and bred to the most  ordinary of careers, in the least spiritual of atmospheres—that  superabundant energy, that genius for success which triumphed best in  the most hopeless situations? Francis found it before the crucifix in  St. Damiano, and renewed it in the ineffable experience of La Verna;  when “by mental possession and rapture he was transfigured of  God.” Ignatius found it in the long contemplations and hard  discipline of the cave of Manresa, after the act of surrender in which  he dedicated his knighthood to the service of the Mother of God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p91"></a>We see St. Teresa, another born romantic, pass to the  Unitive State after long and bitter struggles between her lower and  higher personality. A chronic invalid over fifty years of age,  weakened by long ill-health and the mortifications of the Purgative  Way she deliberately breaks with her old career in obedience to the  inward Voice, leaves her convent, and starts a new life: coursing  through Spain, and reforming a great religious order in the teeth of  the ecclesiastical world. Yet more amazing, St. Catherine of Siena, an  illiterate daughter of the people, after a three years’ retreat  consummates the mystic marriage, and emerges from the cell of  self-knowledge to dominate the politics of Italy. How came it that  these apparently unsuitable men and women, checked on every side by  inimical environment, ill-health, custom, or poverty achieved these  stupendous destinies? The explanation can only lie in the fact that  all these persons were great mystics, living upon high levels the  theopathetic life. In each a character of the <a name="page_431"><font size="1" color="green">p. 431</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_431"></a>  heroic type, of great vitality, deep enthusiasms, unconquerable will,  was raised to the spiritual plane, remade on higher levels of  consciousness. Each by surrender of selfhood, by acquiescence in the  large destinies of life, had so furthered that self’s natural  genius for the Infinite that their human limitations were overpassed.  Hence they rose to freedom and attained to the one ambition of the  “naughted soul,” “I would fain be to the Eternal  Goodness what his own hand is to a man.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p92"></a>Even Madame Guyon’s natural tendency to passive  states breaks down with her entrance on the Unitive Way. Though she  cannot be classed amongst the greatest of its initiates, she too felt  its fertilizing power, was stung from her “holy  indifference” to become, as it were, involuntarily true to  type.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p93"></a>“The soul,” she says of the self entering  upon Union—and we cannot doubt that as usual she is describing  her own carefully docketed “states”—“feels a  secret vigour taking more and more strongly possession of all her  being: and little by little she receives a new life, never again to be  lost, at least so far as one can be assured of anything in this life.  . . . This new life is not like that which she had before. It is a  life in God. It is a perfect life. She no longer lives or works of  herself: but God lives, acts and works in her, and this grows little  by little till she becomes perfect with God’s perfection, is  rich with His riches, and loves with His love.” . . .   <a name="fr_883"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">884</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p95"></a>This new, intense, and veritable life has other and  even more vital characteristics than those which lead to “the  performance of acts” or “the incessant production of good  works.” It is, in an actual sense, as Richard of St. Victor  reminded us, fertile, creative, as well as merely active. In the  fourth degree of love, the soul brings forth its children. It is the  agent of a fresh outbirth of spiritual vitality into the world; the  helpmate of the Transcendent Order, the mother of a spiritual progeny.  The great unitive mystics are each of them the founders of spiritual  families, centres wherefrom radiates new transcendental life. The  “flowing light of the Godhead” is focussed in them, as in  a lens, only that it may pass through them to spread out on every  side. So, too, the great creative seers and artists are the parents,  not merely of their own immediate works, but also of whole schools of  art, whole groups of persons who acquire or inherit their vision of  beauty or truth. Thus within the area of influence of a Paul, a  Francis, an Ignatius, a Teresa, an atmosphere of reality is created;  and new and vital spiritual personalities gradually appear, meet for  the work which these great founders set in hand. The real witness to  St. Paul’s ecstatic life in God, is the train of Christian  churches by which his journeyings are marked. Wherever Francis passed,  he left <a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="green">p. 432</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_432"></a> Franciscans, “fragrant with a  wondrous aspect,” where none had been before.   <a name="fr_884"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">885</font></a>
     The Friends of God spring up, individual mystics, here and there  through the Rhineland and Bavaria. Each becomes the centre of an ever  widening circle of transcendent life, the parent of a spiritual  family. They are come like their Master, that men may have life more  abundantly: from them new mystic energy is actually born into the  world. Again, Ignatius leaves Manresa a solitary: maimed, ignorant,  and poor. He comes to Rome with his company already formed, and ablaze  with his spirit; veritably his children, begotten of him, part and  parcel of his life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p97"></a>Teresa finds the order of Mount Carmel hopelessly  corrupt: its friars and nuns blind to reality, indifferent to the  obligations of the cloistered life. She is moved by the Spirit to  leave her convent and begin, in abject poverty, the foundation of new  houses, where the most austere and exalted life of contemplation shall  be led. She enters upon this task to the accompaniment of an almost  universal mockery. Mysteriously, as she proceeds, novices of the  spiritual life appear and cluster around her. They come into  existence, one knows not how, in the least favourable of atmospheres:  but one and all are salted with the Teresian salt. They receive the  infection of her abundant vitality: embrace eagerly and joyously the  heroic life of the Reform. In the end, every city in Spain has within  it Teresa’s spiritual children: a whole order of contemplatives,  as truly born of her as if they were indeed her sons and daughters in  the flesh. Well might the Spiritual Alchemists say that the true  <a name="an_iv.x-p97.1"></a>“Lapis  Philosophorum” is a   <i>tinging stone:</i>    which imparts its goldness to the base metals brought within its  sphere of influence.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p98"></a>This reproductive power is one of the greatest marks  of the theopathetic life: the true “mystic marriage” of  the individual soul with its Source. Those rare personalities in whom  it is found are the   <i>media</i>    through which that Triumphing Spiritual Life which is the essence of  reality forces an entrance into the temporal order and begets  children; heirs of the superabundant vitality of the transcendental  universe.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p99"></a>But the Unitive Life is more than the sum total of its  symptoms: more than the heroic and apostolic life of the “great  active”: more than the divine motherhood of new “sons and  daughters of the Absolute.” These are only its outward signs,  its expression in time and space. I have first laid stress upon that  expression, because it is the side which all critics and some friends  of the mystics persistently ignore. The contemplative’s power of  living this intense and creative life within the temporal order,  however, is tightly bound up with that other life in which he attains  to <a name="page_433"><font size="1" color="green">p. 433</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_433"></a> complete communion with the Absolute Order, and  submits to the inflow of its supernal vitality. In discussing the  relation of the mystical experience to philosophy,   <a name="fr_885"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">886</font></a>
     we saw that the complete mystic consciousness, and therefore, of  course, the complete mystic world, had a twofold character which could  hardly be reconciled with the requirements of monism. It embraced a  Reality which seems from the human standpoint at once static and  dynamic, transcendent and immanent, eternal and temporal: accepted  both the absolute World of Pure Being and the unresting World of  Becoming as integral parts of its vision of Truth, demanding on its  side a dual response. All through the Mystic Way we caught glimpses of  the growth and exercise of this dual intuition of the Real. Now, the  mature mystic, having come to his full stature, passed through the  purifications of sense and of spirit and entered on his heritage, must  and does take up as a part of that heritage not merely (  <i>a</i>   ) a fruition of the Divine Goodness, Truth, and Beauty, his place  within the Sempiternal Rose, nor (  <i>b</i>   ) the creative activity of an agent of the Eternal Wisdom, still  immersed in the River of Life: but both together—the twofold  destiny of the spiritual man, called to “incarnate the Eternal  in time.” To use the old scholastic language, he is at once  patient and agent: patient as regards God, agent as regards the  world.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p101"></a>In a deep sense it may be said of him that he now  participates according to his measure in that divine-human life which  mediates between man and the Eternal, and constitutes the  “salvation of the world.” Therefore, though his outward  heroic life of action, his divine fecundity, may seem to us the best  evidence of his state, it is the inner knowledge of his mystical  sonship whereby “we feel eternal life in us above all other  thing,”   <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">887</font></a>
     which is for him the guarantee of absolute life. He has many ways of  describing this central fact; this peculiar consciousness of his own  transcendence, which coexists with, and depends on, a complete  humility. Sometimes he says that whereas in the best moments of his  natural life he was but the “faithful servant” of the  eternal order, and in the illuminated way became its “secret  friend,” he is now advanced to the final, most mysterious state  of “hidden child.” “How great,” says  Ruysbroeck, “is the difference between the secret friend and the  hidden child! For the friend makes only loving, living, but measured  ascents towards God. But the child presses on to lose his own life  upon the summits, in that simplicity which knoweth not itself. . . .  When we transcend ourselves and become in our ascent towards God so  simple that the bare supreme Love can lay hold of us, then we cease,  and we and all our selfhood <a name="page_434"><font size="1" color="green">p. 434</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_434"></a> die in God. And in this  death we become the hidden children of God, and find a new life within  us.”   <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">888</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p104"></a>Though the outer career of the great mystic, then, be  one of superhuman industry, a long fight with evil and adversity, his  real and inner life dwells securely upon the heights; in the perfect  fruition which he can only suggest to us by the paradoxical symbols of  ignorance and emptiness. He dominates existence because he thus  transcends it: is a son of God, a member of the eternal order, shares  its substantial life. “Tranquillity according to His essence,  activity according to His Nature: absolute repose, absolute  fecundity”: this, says Ruysbroeck again, is the twofold property  of Godhead: and the secret child of the Absolute participates in this  dual character of Reality—“for this dignity has man been  made.”   <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">889</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p106"></a>Those two aspects of truth which he has so clumsily  classified as static and dynamic, as Being and Becoming, now find  their final reconciliation within his own nature: for that nature has  become conscious in all its parts, has unified itself about its  highest elements. That strange, tormenting vision of a perfect peace,  a joyous self-loss, annihilation in some mighty Life that overpassed  his own, which haunts man throughout the whole course of his history,  and finds a more or less distorted expression in all his creeds, a  justification in all his ecstasies, is now traced to its source: and  found to be the inevitable expression of an instinct by which he  recognized, though he could not attain, the noblest part of his  inheritance. This recognition of his has of necessity been imperfect  and oblique. It has taken in many temperaments an exaggerated form,  and has been further disguised by the symbolic language used to  describe it. The tendency of Indian mysticism to regard the Unitive  Life wholly in its passive aspect, as a total self-annihilation, a  disappearance into the substance of the Godhead, results, I believe,  from such a distortion of truth. The Oriental mystic “presses on  to lose his life upon the heights”; but he does not come back  and bring to his fellow-men the life-giving news that he has  transcended mortality in the interests of the race. The temperamental  bias of Western mystics towards activity has saved them as a rule from  such one-sided achievement as this; and hence it is in them that the  Unitive Life, with its “dual character of activity and  rest,” has assumed its richest and noblest forms.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p107"></a>Of these Western mystics none has expressed more  lucidly or splendidly than Ruysbroeck the double nature of man’s  reaction to Reality. It is the heart of his vision of truth. In all  his books he returns to it again and again: speaking, as none familiar  with his <a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="green">p. 435</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_435"></a> writings can doubt, the ardent, joyous,  vital language of firsthand experience, not the platitudes of  philosophy. He might say with Dante, his forerunner into the  Empyrean:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.x-p107.1"></a> “La forma universal di questo nodo<br>   credo ch’ io vidi, perchè più di  largo<br>   dicendo questo, mi sento ch’ io godo.”   <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">890</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p109"></a>It is then from Ruysbroeck that I shall make my  quotations: and if they be found somewhat long and difficult of  comprehension, their unique importance for the study of man’s  spiritual abilities must be my excuse.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p110"></a>First, his vision of God:—</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p111"></a>“The Divine Persons,” he says, “Who  form one sole God, are in the fecundity of their nature ever active:  and in the simplicity of their essence they form the Godhead and  eternal blessedness. Thus God according to the Persons is Eternal  Work: but according to the essence and Its perpetual stillness, He is  Eternal Rest. Now love and fruition live between this activity and  this rest. Love would ever be active: for its nature is eternal  working with God. Fruition is ever at rest, for it consists above all  will and all desire, in the embrace of the well-beloved by the  well-beloved in a simple and imageless love; wherein the Father,  together with the Son, enfolds His beloved ones in the fruitive unity  of His Spirit, above the fecundity of nature. And that same Father  says to each soul in His infinite loving kindness, ‘Thou art  Mine and I am thine: I am thine and thou art Mine, for I have chosen  thee from all eternity.’”   <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">891</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p113"></a>Next the vision of the self’s destiny:  “Our activity consists in loving God and our fruition in  enduring God and being penetrated by His love. There is a distinction  between love and fruition, as there is between God and His Grace. When  we unite ourselves to God by love, then we are spirit: but when we are  caught up and transformed by His Spirit, then we are led into  fruition. And the spirit of God Himself breathes us out from Himself  that we may love, and may do good works; and again He draws us into  Himself, that we may rest in fruition. And this is Eternal Life; even  as our mortal life subsists in the indrawing and outgoing of our  breath.”   <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">892</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p115"></a>“Understand,” he says again, “God  comes to us incessantly, both with means and without means; and He  demands of us both action and fruition, in such away that the action  never hinders the fruition, nor the fruition the action, but they  strengthen one <a name="page_436"><font size="1" color="green">p. 436</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_436"></a> another. And this is why the  interior man [  <i>i.e.,</i>    the contemplative] lives his life according to these two ways; that  is to say, in rest and in work. And in each of them he is wholly and  undividedly; for he dwells wholly in God in virtue of his restful  fruition and wholly in himself in virtue of his active love. And God,  in His communications, perpetually calls and urges him to renew both  this rest and this work. And because the soul is just, it desires to  pay at every instant that which God demands of it; and this is why  each time it is irradiated of Him, the soul turns inward in a manner  that is both active and fruitive, and thus it is renewed in all  virtues and ever more profoundly immersed in fruitive rest. . . . It  is active in all loving work, for it sees its rest. It is a pilgrim,  for it sees its country. For love’s sake it strives for victory,  for it sees its crown. Consolation, peace, joy, beauty and riches, all  that can give delight, all this is shown to the mind illuminated in  God, in spiritual similitudes and without measure. And through this  vision and touch of God, love continues active. For such a just man  has built up in his own soul, in rest and in work, a veritable life  which shall endure for ever, but which shall be transformed after this  present life to a state still more sublime. Thus this man is just, and  he goes   <i>towards</i>    God by inward love, in eternal work, and he goes in God by his  fruitive inclination in eternal rest. And he dwells in God; and yet he  goes out towards all creatures, in a spirit of love towards all  things, in virtue and in works of righteousness.   <i>And this is she supreme summit of the inner life</i>   .”   <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">893</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p117"></a>Compare this description with the careers of the  theopathetic mystics, in whom, indeed, “action has not injured  fruition, nor fruition action,” who have by some secret  adjustment contrived to “possess their lives in rest and in  work” without detriment to inward joy or outward industry. Bear  in mind as you read these words—Ruysbroeck’s supreme  effort to tell the true relation between man’s created spirit  and his God—the great public ministry of St. Catherine of Siena,  which ranged from the tending of the plague-stricken to the reforming  of the Papacy; and was accompanied by the inward fruitive  consciousness of the companionship of Christ. Remember the humbler but  not less beautiful and significant achievement of her Genoese  namesake: the strenuous lives of St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius,  St. Teresa, outwardly cumbered with much serving, observant of an  infinitude of tiresome details, composing rules, setting up  foundations, neglecting no aspect of their business which could  conduce to its practical success, yet “altogether dwelling in  God in restful fruition.” Are not all these supreme examples of  the state in which the self, at last fully conscious, knowing Reality  because she is wholly real, <a name="page_437"><font size="1" color="green">p. 437</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_437"></a> pays her debt? Unable  to rest entirely either in work or in fruition, she seizes on this  twofold expression of the superabundant life by which she is  possessed: and, on the double wings of eagerness and effort, takes  flight towards her Home.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p118"></a>In dwelling, as we have done, on the ways in which the  great mystic makes actual to himself the circumstances of the Unitive  State, we must not forget that this state is, in essence, a fulfilment  of love; the attainment of a “heart’s desire.” By  this attainment, this lifting of the self to free union with the  Real—as by the earthly marriage which dimly prefigures  it—a new life is entered upon, new powers, new responsibilities  are conferred. But this is not all. The three prime activities of the  normal self, feeling, intellect, and will, though they seem to be  fused, are really carried up to a higher term. They are unified, it is  true, but still present in their integrity; and each demands and  receives full satisfaction in the attainment of this fillal  “honour for which man has been made.” The intellect is  immersed in that mighty vision of truth, known now not as a vision but  as a home; where St. Paul saw things which might not be uttered, St.  Teresa found the “perpetual companionship of the Blessed  Trinity,” and Dante, caught to its heart for one brief moment,  his mind smitten by the blinding flash of the Uncreated light, knew  that he had resolved Reality’s last paradox: the unity of  <a name="an_iv.x-p118.1"></a>  <i>“cerchio”</i>   and <a name="an_iv.x-p118.2"></a>  <i>“imago”</i>     <i>—</i>   the infinite and personal aspects of God.   <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">894</font></a>
     The enhanced will, made over to the interests of the Transcendent,  receives new worlds to conquer, new strength to match its exalted  destiny. But the heart too here enters on a new order, begins to live  upon high levels of joy. “This soul, says Love, swims in the sea  of joy: that is, in the sea of delight, the stream of divine  influences.”   <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">895</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p121"></a><a name="an_iv.x-p121.1"></a>  <i>“Amans volat, currit et laetatur: liber est et non  tenetur</i>   ,”   <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">896</font></a>
    said à Kempis: classic words, which put before us once and for  ever the inward joyousness and liberty of the saints. They “fly,  run, and rejoice”—those great, laborious souls, often  spent with amazing mortifications, vowed to hard and never-ending  tasks. They are “free, and nothing can hold them,” though  they seem to the world fenced in by absurd renunciations and  restrictions, deprived of that cheap licence which it knows as  liberty.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p123"></a>That fruition of joy of which Ruysbroeck speaks in  majestic phrases, as constituting the interior life of mystic souls  immersed in the Absolute—the translation of the Beatific Vision  into the terms of a supernal feeling-state—is often realized in  the secret experience of those same mystics, as the perennial  possession of a childlike gaiety, an inextinguishable gladness of  heart. The <a name="page_438"><font size="1" color="green">p. 438</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_438"></a> transfigured souls move to the measures  of a “love dance” which persists in mirth without  comparison, through every outward hardship and tribulation. They enjoy  the high spirits peculiar to high spirituality: and shock the world by  a delicate playfulness, instead of exhibiting the morose resignation  which it feels to be proper to the “spiritual life.” Thus  St. Catherine of Siena, though constantly suffering, “was always  jocund and of a happy spirit.” When prostrate with illness she  overflowed with gaiety and gladness, and “was full of laughter  in the Lord, exultant and rejoicing. “   <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">897</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p125"></a>Moreover, the most clear-sighted amongst the mystics  declare such joy to be an implicit of Reality. Thus Dante, initiated  into Paradise, sees the whole Universe laugh with delight as it  glorifies God:   <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">898</font></a>
     and the awful countenance of Perfect Love adorned with smiles.   <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">899</font></a>
     Thus the souls of the great theologians dance to music and laughter  in the Heaven of the Sun;   <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">900</font></a>
     the loving seraphs, in their ecstatic joy, whirl about the Being of  God.   <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">901</font></a>
     <a name="an_iv.x-p129.1"></a>“O   <i>luce sterna che . . . ami ed arridi,</i>   ” exclaims the pilgrim, as the Divine Essence is  at last revealed to him,   <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">902</font></a>
     and he perceives love and joy as the final attributes of the Triune  God. Thus Beatrice with   <i>“suoi occhi ridenti”</i>—  so different from the world’s idea of a suitable demeanour for  the soul’s supreme instructress—laughs as she mounts with  him the ladder to the stars. So, if the deified soul has indeed run  ahead of humanity and “according to his fruition dwells in  heaven,” he too, like Francis, will run, rejoice and make merry:  join the eager dance of the Universe about the One. “If,”  says Patmore, “we may credit certain hints contained in the  lives of the saints, love raises the spirit above the sphere of  reverence and worship into one of laughter and dalliance: a sphere in  which the soul says:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.x-p130.1"></a> “‘Shall I, a gnat which dances in Thy  ray,<br>     <i>Dare</i>    to be reverent?’”   <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">903</font></a>
   <br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p132"></a>Richard Rolle has expressed this exultant  “spirit of dalliance” with peculiar insight and delicacy.  “Among the delights which he tastes in so sweet love  burning,” he says of the true lover who “in the bond of  the lovers’ will stably is confirmed,” “a heavenly  privity inshed he feels, that no man can know but he that has received  it, and in himself bears the electuary that anoints and makes happy  all joyful lovers in Jesu; so that they cease not to hie in heavenly  seats to sit, endlessly their Maker to enjoy. Hereto truly they yearn  in heavenly sights abiding; and inwardly set <a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="green">p. 439</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_439"></a> afire,  all their inward parts are glad with pleasant shining in light. And  themselves they feel gladdened with merriest love, and in joyful song  wonderfully melted. . . . But this grace generally and to all is not  given, but to the holy soul imbued with the holiest is taught; in whom  the excellence of love shines, and songs of lovely loving, Christ  inspiring, commonly burst up, and being made as it were a pipe of  love, in sight of God more goodly than can be said, joying sounds. The  which (soul) the mystery of love knowing, with great cry to its Love  ascends, in wit sharpest, and in knowledge and in feeling subtle; not  spread in things of this world but into God all gathered and set, that  in cleanness of conscience and shining of soul to Him it may serve  Whom it has purposed to love, and itself to Him to give. Surely the  clearer the love of the lover is, the nearer to him and the more  present God is. And thereby more clearly in God he joys, and of the  sweet Goodness the more he feels, that to lovers is wont Itself to  inshed, and to mirth without comparison the hearts of the meek to  turn.”   <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">904</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p134"></a>The state of burning love, said Rolle, than which he  could conceive no closer reaction to Reality, was the state of  Sweetness and Song: the welling up of glad music in the simple soul,  man’s natural expression of a joy which overpasses the  descriptive powers of our untuneful speech. In the gay rhythms of that  primordial art he may say something of the secret which the more  decorous periods of religion and philosophy will never let him tell:  something, too, which in its very childishness, its freedom from the  taint of solemnity and self-importance, expresses the quality of that  inward life, that perpetual youth, which the “secret  child” of the Transcendent Order enjoys. “As it were a  pipe of love” in the sight of God he “joying  sounds.” The music of the spheres is all about him: he is a part  of the great melody of the Divine. “Sweetest forsooth,”  says Rolle again, “is the rest which the spirit takes whilst  sweet goodly sound comes down, in which it is delighted: and in most  sweet song and playful the mind is ravished to sing likings of love  everlasting.”   <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">905</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p136"></a>When we come to look at the lives of the mystics, we  find it literally true that such “songs of lovely loving  commonly burst up” whenever we can catch them unawares; see  behind the formidable and heroic activities of reformer, teacher, or  leader of men the <a name="an_iv.x-p136.1"></a>  <i>vie intime</i>    which is lived at the hearth of Love. “What are  the servants of the Lord but His minstrels?” said St. Francis,   <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">906</font></a>
     who saw nothing inconsistent between the Celestial Melodies and the  Stigmata of Christ. Moreover the songs of such troubadours, as <a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="green">p. 440</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_440"></a> the hermit of Hampole learned in his wilderness, are not  only sweet but playful. Dwelling always in a light of which we hardly  dare to think, save in the extreme terms of reverence and awe, they  are not afraid with any amazement: they are at home.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p138"></a>The whole life of St. Francis of Assisi, that spirit  transfigured in God, who “loved above all other birds a certain  little bird which is called the lark,”   <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">907</font></a>
     was one long march to music through the world. To sing seemed to him  a primary spiritual function: he taught his friars in their preaching  to urge all men to this.   <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">908</font></a>
     It appeared to him appropriate and just to use the romantic language  of the troubadours in praise of the perfect Love which had marked him  as Its own. “Drunken with the love and compassion of Christ,  blessed Francis on a time did things such as these. For the most sweet  melody of spirit boiling up within him, frequently broke out in French  speech, and the veins of murmuring which he heard secretly with his  ears broke forth into French-like rejoicing. And sometimes he picked  up a branch from the earth, and laying it on his left arm, he drew in  his right hand another stick like a bow over it, as if on a viol or  other instrument, and, making fitting gestures, sang with it in French  unto the Lord Jesus Christ.”   <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">909</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p142"></a>Many a time has the romantic quality of the Unitive  Life—its gaiety, freedom, assurance, and joy—broken out in  “French-like rejoicings”; which have a terribly frivolous  sound for worldly ears, and seem the more preposterous as coming from  people whose outward circumstances are of the most uncomfortable kind.  St. John of the Cross wrote love songs to his Love. St. Rose of Lima  sang duets with the birds. St. Teresa, in the austere and  poverty-stricken seclusion of her first foundation, did not disdain to  make rustic hymns and carols for her daughters’ use in the  dialect of Old Castile. Like St. Francis, she had a horror of  solemnity. It was only fit for hypocrites, thought these rejuvenators  of the Church. The hard life of prayer and penance on Mount Carmel was  undertaken in a joyous spirit to the sound of many songs. Its great  Reformer was quick to snub the too-spiritual sister who “thought  it better to contemplate than to sing”: and was herself heard,  as she swept the convent corridor, to sing a little ditty about the  most exalted of her own mystical experiences: that ineffable  transverberation, in which the fiery arrow of the seraph pierced her  heart.   <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">910</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p144"></a>But the most lovely and real, most human and near to  us, of all these descriptions of the celestial exhilaration which  mystic surrender brings in its train, is the artless, unintentional  self-revelation <a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="green">p. 441</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_441"></a> of St. Catherine of Genoa, whose  inner and outer lives in their balanced wholeness provide us with one  of our best standards by which to judge the right proportions of the  Mystic Way. Here the whole essence of the Unitive Life is summed up  and presented to us by one who lived it upon heroic levels: and who  was, in fruition and activity, in rest and in work, not only a great  active and a great ecstatic, but one of the deepest gazers into the  secrets of Eternal Love that the history of Christian mysticism  contains. Yet perhaps there is no passage in the works of these same  mystics which comes to so unexpected, so startling a conclusion as  this; in which St. Catherine, with a fearless simplicity, shows to her  fellow-men the nature of the path that she has trodden and the place  that she has reached.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p145"></a>“When,” she says, in one of her reported  dialogues—and though the tone be impersonal it is clearly  personal experience which speaks—“the loving kindness of  God calls a soul from the world, He finds it full of vices and sins;  and first He gives it an instinct for virtue, and then urges it to  perfection, and then by infused grace leads it to true self-naughting,  and at last to true transformation. And this noteworthy order serves  God to lead the soul along the Way: but when the soul is naughted and  transformed, then of herself she neither works nor speaks nor wills,  nor feels nor hears nor understands, neither has she of herself the  feeling of outward or inward, where she may move. And in all things it  is God Who rules and guides her, without the mediation of any  creature. And the state of this soul is then a feeling of such utter  peace and tranquillity that it seems to her that her heart, and her  bodily being, and all both within and without is immersed in an ocean  of utmost peace; from when she shall never come forth for anything  that can befall her in this life. And she stays immovable,  imperturbable, impassible. So much so, that it seems to her in her  human and her spiritual nature, both within and without, she can feel  no other thing than sweetest peace. And she is so full of peace that  though she press her flesh, her nerves, her bones, no other thing  comes forth from them than peace. Then says she all day for joy such  rhymes as these, making them according to her manner:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.x-p145.2"></a>  “‘Vuoi tu che tu mostr’io<br>    Presto che cosa è Dio?<br>    Pace non trova chi da lui si  partiò.’” <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">911</font></a>
 <br>  </blockquote>     <a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="green">p. 442</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_442"></a>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p151"></a>“Then says she all day for joy such rhymes as  these”—nursery rhymes, one might almost call them: so  infantile, so naive is their rhythm. Who would have suspected this to  be the secret manner of communion between the exalted soul of  Catherine and her Love? How many of those who actually saw that great  and able woman labouring in the administration of her  hospital—who heard that profound and instinctive Christian  Platonist instructing her disciples, and declaring the law of  universal and heroic love—how many of these divined that  “questa santa benedetta” who seemed to them already  something more than earthly, a matter of solemn congratulation and  reverential approach, went about her work with a heart engaged in no  lofty speculations on Eternity; no outpourings of mystic passion for  the Absolute; but “saying all day for joy,” in a spirit of  childlike happiness, gay and foolish little songs about her Love?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p152"></a>Standing at the highest point of the mystic ladder  which can be reached by human spirits in this world of time and space,  looking back upon the course of that slow interior alchemy, that  “noteworthy order” of organic transformation, by which her  selfhood had been purged of imperfection, raised to higher levels,  compelled at last to surrender itself to the all-embracing,  all-demanding life of the Real; this is St. Catherine’s  deliberate judgment on the relative and absolute aspects of the mystic  life. The “noteworthy order” which we have patiently  followed, the psychic growth and rearrangement of character, the  visions and ecstasies, the joyous illumination and bitter  pain—these but “served to lead the soul along the  way.” In the mighty transvaluation of values which takes place  when that way has at last been trod, these “abnormal  events” sink to insignificance. For us, looking out wistfully  along the pathway to reality, they stand out, it is true, as supreme  landmarks, by which we may trace the homeward course of pilgrim man.  Their importance cannot be overrated for those who would study the way  to that world from this. But the mystic, safe in that silence where  lovers lose themselves, “his cheek on Him Who for his coming  came,” remembers them no more. In the midst of his active work,  his incessant spiritual creation, joy and peace enfold him. He needs  no stretched and sharpened intuition now: for he dwells in that  “most perfect form of contemplation” which “consists  in simple and perceived contact of the substance of the soul with that  of the divine.”   <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">912</font></a>
     <a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="green">p. 443</font></a> <a name="an_iv.x-Page_443"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p154"></a>The wheel of life has made its circle. Here, at the  last point of its revolution, the extremes of sublimity and simplicity  are seen to meet. It has swept the soul of the mystic through periods  of alternate stress and glory; tending ever to greater transcendence,  greater freedom, closer contact with “the Supplier of true  life.” He emerges from that long and wondrous journey to find  himself in rest and in work, a little child upon the bosom of the  Father. In that most dear relation all feeling, will, and thought  attain their end. Here all the teasing complications of our separated  selfhood are transcended. Hence the eager striving, the sharp vision,  are not wanted any more. In that mysterious death of selfhood on the  summits which is the medium of Eternal Life, heights meet the deeps:  supreme achievement and complete humility are one.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p155"></a>In a last brief vision, a glimpse as overpowering to  our common minds as Dante’s final intuition of reality to his  exalted and courageous soul, we see the triumphing spirit, sent out  before us the best that earth can offer, stoop and strip herself of  the insignia of wisdom and power. Achieving the highest, she takes the  lowest place. Initiated into the atmosphere of Eternity, united with  the Absolute, possessed at last of the fullness of Its life, the soul,  self-naughted becomes as a little child: for of such is the kingdom of  heaven.</p>

 <p><a name="an_iv.x-p150"></a>Here, in spite of the many revisions to    which the Vita has been subjected, I cannot but see an authentic    report of St. Catherine’s inner mind; highly characteristic of    the personality which “came joyous and rosy-faced” from    its ecstatic encounters with Love. The very unexpectedness of its    conclusion, so unlike the expressions supposed to be proper to the    saints, is a guarantee of its authenticity. On the text of the    “Vita” see Von Hügel, “The Mystical Element    of Religion,” vol. i., Appendix.</p>
