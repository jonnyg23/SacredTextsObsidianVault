   <h4 align="center">ODE 3. THE <i>K</i>Î ȜUI.</h4>  <h4>RESPONSIVE TO THE LAST:--THE UNCLES AND BRETHREN OF THE KING EXPRESS THEIR SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS, AND THEIR WISHES FOR HIS HAPPINESS, MOSTLY IN THE WORDS IN WHICH THE PERSONATORS OF THE DEPARTED ANCESTORS HAD CONVEYED THEIR SATISFACTION WITH THE SACRIFICE OFFERED TO THEM, AND PROMISED TO HIM THEIR BLESSING.</h4>  
 <p>You have made us drink to the full of your spirit; You have satiated us with your kindness. May you enjoy, O our lord,, myriads of years! May your bright happiness (ever) be increased!</p>  
 <p>You have made us drink to the full of your spirits; Your viands were set out before us. May you enjoy, O our lord, myriads of years! May your bright intelligence ever be increased!</p>  
 <p>May your bright intelligence become perfect, High and brilliant, leading to a good end! That good end has (now) its beginning:--The personators of your ancestors announced it in their blessing.</p>  
 <p>What was their announcement? '(The offerings) in your dishes of bamboo and wood are clean and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_402"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 402</font></a></p>  
 <p>fine. Your friends <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_544"><font size="1">1</font></a>, assisting in the service, Have done their part with reverent demeanour.</p>  
 <p>'Your reverent demeanour was altogether what the occasion required; And also that of your filial son <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_545"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For such filial piety, continued without ceasing, There will ever be conferred blessings upon you.'</p>  
 <p>What will the blessings be? 'That along the passages of your palace, You shall move for ten thousand years, And there will be granted to you for ever dignity and posterity.'</p>  
 <p>How as to your posterity? 'Heaven invests you with your dignity; Yea, for ten thousand years, The bright appointment is attached (to your line).'</p>  
 <p>How is it attached? 'There is given you a heroic wife. There is given you a heroic wife, And from her shall come the (line of) descendants.'</p>
