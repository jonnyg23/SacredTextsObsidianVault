   <h4 align="center">ODE 2. THE TÂ MING.</h4>  <h4>HOW THE APPOINTMENT OF HEAVEN OR GOD CAME FROM HIS FATHER TO KING WĂN, AND DESCENDED TO HIS SON, KING WÛ, WHO OVERTHREW THE DYNASTY OF SHANG BY HIS VICTORY AT MÛ; CELEBRATING ALSO THE MOTHER AND WIFE OF KING WĂN.</h4>  
 <p>The illustration of illustrious (virtue) is required below, And the dread majesty is or, high <a name="fr_497"></a><a href="#fn_480"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Heaven is not readily to be relied on; It is not easy to be king. Yin's rightful heir to the heavenly seat Was not permitted to possess the kingdom.</p>  
 <p><i>Z</i>ăn, the second of the princesses of <i>K</i>ih <a name="fr_498"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">3</font></a>, From (the domain of) Yin-shang, Came to be married to (the prince of) <i>K</i>âu, And became his wife in his</p>

 <p>capital. Both she and king <i>K</i>î Were entirely virtuous. (Then) Thâi-<i>z</i>ăn became pregnant, And gave birth to our king Wăn.</p>  
 <p>This king Wăn, Watchfully and reverently, With entire intelligence served God, And so secured the great blessing. His virtue was without deflection; And in consequence he received (the allegiance of) the states from all quarters.</p>  
 <p>Heaven surveyed this lower world; And its appointment lighted (on king Wăn). In his early years, It made for him a mate <a name="fr_499"></a><a href="#fn_482"><font size="1">1</font></a>;--On the north of the Hsiâ, On the banks of the Wei. When king Wăn would marry, There was the lady in a large state <a name="fr_500"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In a large state was the lady, Like a fair denizen of heaven. The ceremonies determined the auspiciousness (of the union) <a name="fr_501"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">3</font></a>, And in person he met her on the Wei. Over it he made a bridge of boats; The glory (of the occasion) was illustrious.</p>  
 <p>The favouring appointment was from Heaven, Giving the throne to our kin Wăn, In the capital of <i>K</i>âu. The lady-successor was from Hsin, Its eldest daughter, who came to marry him. She was blessed to give birth to king Wû, Who was preserved, and helped, and received (also) the. appointment,</p>

 <p>The troops of Yin-shang Were collected like a forest, And marshalled in the wilderness of Mû. We rose (to the crisis); 'God is with you,' (said Shang-fû to the king), 'Have no doubts in your heart <a name="fr_502"></a><a href="#fn_485"><font size="1">1</font></a>.'</p>  
 <p>The wilderness of Mû spread out extensive; Bright shone the chariots of sandal; The teams of bays, black-maned and white-bellied, galloped along; The Grand-Master Shang-fû. Was like an eagle on the wing, Assisting king Wû, Who at one onset smote the great Shang. That morning's encounter was followed by a clear, bright (day).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_480"></a><a href="sbe03128.htm#fr_497">380:2</a> 'The first two lines,' says the commentator Yen <i>Ȝh</i>an, 'contain a general sentiment, expressing the principle that governs the relation between Heaven and men. According to line 1, the good or evil of a ruler cannot be concealed; according to 2, Heaven, in giving its favour or taking it away, acts with strict decision. When below there is the illustrious illustration (of virtue), that reaches up on high. When above there is the awful majesty, that exercises a survey below. The relation between Heaven and men ought to excite our awe.'</p>

She is called in the eighth line Thâi-<i>z</i>ăn, by which name she is still famous in China.
