   <h4 align="center">ODE 5. THE HAN LÛ.</h4>  <h4 align="center">IN PRAISE OF THE VIRTUE OF KING WĂN, BLESSED BY HIS ANCESTORS, AND RAISED TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY WITHOUT' SEEKING OF HIS OWN.</h4>  
 <p>Look at the foot of the Han <a name="fr_517"></a><a href="#fn_500"><font size="1">3</font></a>, How abundantly grow the hazel and arrow-thorn <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_501"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, In his pursuit of dignity (still) easy and self-possessed.</p>  
 <p>Massive is that libation-cup of jade, With the</p>

 <p>yellow liquid sparkling in it <a name="fr_519"></a><a href="#fn_502"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, The fit recipient of blessing and dignity.</p>  
 <p>The hawk flies up to heaven, The fishes leap in the deep <a name="fr_520"></a><a href="#fn_503"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Easy and self-possessed was our prince:--Did he not exert an influence on men?</p>  
 <p>His clear spirits were in the vessels; His red bull was ready <a name="fr_521"></a><a href="#fn_504"><font size="1">3</font></a>;--To offer, to sacrifice, To increase his bright happiness.</p>  
 <p>Thick grow the oaks and the buckthorn, Which the people use for fuel <a name="fr_522"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">4</font></a>. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, Cheered and encouraged by the spirits <a name="fr_523"></a><a href="#fn_505"><font size="1">4</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Luxuriant are the dolichos and other creepers, Clinging to the branches and stems. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, Seeking for happiness by no crooked ways.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_500"></a><a href="sbe03131.htm#fr_517">386:3</a> Where mount Han was cannot now be determined.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_501"></a><a href="sbe03131.htm#fr_518">386:4</a> As the foot of the hill was favourable to vegetable growth, so were king Wăn's natural qualities to his distinction and advancement.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_502"></a><a href="sbe03131.htm#fr_519">387:1</a> As a cup of such quality was the proper receptacle for the yellow, herb-flavoured spirits, so was the character of Wăn such that all blessing must accrue to him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_503"></a><a href="sbe03131.htm#fr_520">387:2</a> It is the nature of the hawk to fly and of fishes to swim, and so there went out an influence from Wăn unconsciously to himself.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_504"></a><a href="sbe03131.htm#fr_521">387:3</a> Red, we have seen, was the proper colour for victims in the ancestral temple of <i>K</i>âu.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_505"></a><a href="sbe03131.htm#fr_523">387:4</a> As it was natural for the people to take the wood and use it, so it was natural for the spirits of his ancestors, and spiritual beings generally, to bless king Wăn.</p>
