   <h4 align="center">ODE 6, STANZAS 5 AND 6. THE HSIANG PO.</h4>  <h4>A EUNUCH, HIMSELF THE VICTIM OF SLANDER, COMPLAINS OF HIS FATE, AND WARNS AND DENOUNCES HIS ENEMIES; APPEALING AGAINST THEM, AS HIS LAST RESORT, TO HEAVEN.</h4>  
 <p>The proud are delighted, And the troubled are in sorrow. O azure Heaven! O azure Heaven! Look on those proud men, Pity those who are troubled.</p>  
 <p>Those slanderers! Who devised their schemes for them? I would take those slanderers, And throw them to wolves and tigers. If these refused to devour them, I would cast them into the north <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">1</font></a>. If the north refused to receive them, I would throw them into the hands of great (Heaven) <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_427"></a><a href="sbe03117.htm#fr_441">361:2</a> 'Great Heaven;' 'Heaven' has to be supplied here, but there <a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a> is no doubt as to the propriety of doing so; and, moreover, the peculiar phraseology of the line shows that the poet did not rest in the thought of the material heavens.</p>
