   <h5 align="center">ODE 8. THE ȜÂI HSIEN.</h5>  <h5 align="center">APPROPRIATE TO AN OCCASION WHEN THE FEUDAL PRINCES HAD BEEN ASSISTING KING <i>KH</i>ĂNG AT A SACRIFICE TO HIS FATHER.</h5>  
 <p>They appeared before their sovereign king, To seek from him the rules (they were to observe). With their dragon-emblazoned banners, flying bright, The bells on them and their front-boards tinkling, And with the rings on the ends of the reins glittering, Admirable was their majesty and splendour.</p>  
 <p>He led them to appear before his father shrined on the left <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">2</font></a>, Where he discharged his filial duty, and presented his offerings;--That he might have granted to him long life, And ever preserve (his dignity). Great and many are his blessings. They are the brilliant and accomplished princes, Who cheer him with his many sources of happiness,</p>
