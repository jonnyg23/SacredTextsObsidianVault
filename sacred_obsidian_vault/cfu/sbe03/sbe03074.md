   <h5 align="center">ODE 5. THE THIEN ȜO.</h5>  <h5 align="center">APPROPRIATE TO A SACRIFICE TO KING THÂI.</h5>  
 <p><font size="-1">We cannot tell what the sacrifice was; and the Preface, indeed, says that the piece was used in the seasonal sacrifices to all the former king., s and dukes of the House of <i>K</i>âu. King Thâi was the grandfather of king Wăn, and, before he received that title, was known as 'the ancient duke Than-fû.' In B.C. 1327, he moved with his followers from Pin, an earlier seat of his House, and settled in the plain of <i>Kh</i>î, about fifty lî to the north-east of the present district city of <i>Kh</i>î-shan, in Shen-hsî.</font></p>

He made the commencement with it, And king Wăn tranquilly (carried on the work), (Till) that rugged (mount) <i>Kh</i>î Had level roads leading to it. May their descendants ever preserve it!</p>
