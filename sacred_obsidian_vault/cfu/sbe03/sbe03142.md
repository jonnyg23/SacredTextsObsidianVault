   <h4 align="center">ODE 9, STANZA 1. THE MIN LÂO.</h4>  <h4>IN A TIME OF DISORDER AND SUFFERING, SOME OFFICER OF, DISTINCTION CALLS ON HIS FELLOWS TO JOIN WITH HIM TO EFFECT A REFORMATION IN THE CAPITAL, AND PUT AWAY THE PARTIES WHO WERE THE CAUSE OF THE PREVAILING MISERY.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">With the <i>Kh</i>üan Â, what are called the 'correct' odes of Part III, or those belonging to a period of good government, and the composition of which is ascribed mainly to the duke of <i>K</i>âu, come to an end; and those that follow are the 'changed' Major Odes of the Kingdom, or those belonging to a degenerate period, commencing with this. Some among them, however, are equal to any of the former class. The Min Lâo has been assigned to duke Mû of Shâo, a descendant of duke Khang, the Shih of the Shû, the reputed author of the <i>Kh</i>üan Â, and was directed against king Lî, B.C. 878 to 828.</font></p>  
 <p>The people indeed are heavily burdened, But perhaps a little relief may be got for them. Let us cherish this centre of the kingdom, To secure the repose of the four quarters of it. Let us give no indulgence to the wily and obsequious, In order to make the unconscientious careful, And to repress robbers and oppressors, Who have no fear of the clear will (of Heaven) <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Then let us show kindness to those who are distant, And help those who are near,--Thus establishing (the throne of) our king.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_549"></a><a href="sbe03142.htm#fr_569">407:1</a> 'The clear will,' according to <i>K</i>û Hsî, is 'the clear appointment of Heaven;' according to <i>K</i>û Kung-<i>kh</i>ien, 'correct principle.' They both mean the law of human duty, as gathered from the nature of man's moral constitution conferred by Heaven.</p>
