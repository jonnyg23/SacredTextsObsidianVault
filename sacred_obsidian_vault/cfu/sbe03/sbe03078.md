 <p><font size="-1">The Chinese critics differ in the interpretation of this ode, the Preface and older scholars restricting it to a sacrifice to king Wû, while <i>K</i>û Hsî and others find reference in it, as to me also seems most natural, to <i>Kh</i>ăng and Khang, who succeeded him.</font></p>  
 <p>The arm of king Wû was full of strength; Irresistible was his ardour. Greatly illustrious were <i>Kh</i>ăng and Khang <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">1</font></a>, Kinged by God.</p>  
 <p>When we consider how <i>Kh</i>ăng and Khang Grandly held all within the four quarters (of the kingdom), How penetrating was their intelligence!</p>  
 <p>The bells and drums sound in harmony; The sounding-stones and flutes blend their notes; Abundant blessing is sent down.</p>  
 <p>Blessing is sent down in large measure. Careful and exact is all our deportment; We have drunk, and we have eaten, to the fall; Our happiness and dignity will be prolonged.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_353"></a><a href="sbe03078.htm#fr_365">319:1</a> If the whole piece be understood only of a sacrifice to Wû, this line will have to be translated--'How illustrious was he, who completed (his great work), and secured its tranquillity.' We must deal similarly with the next line. This construction is very forced; nor is the text clear on the view of <i>K</i>û Hsî.</p>
