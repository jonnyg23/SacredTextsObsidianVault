 <p>THIS piece, it is said, was made by Kung <i>K</i>iang, the widow of Kung-po, son of the marquis Hsî of Wei (B.C. 855-814). Kung-po having died an early death, her parents (who must have been the marquis of <i>Kh</i>î and his wife or one of the ladies of his harem) wanted to force her to a second marriage, against which she protests. The ode was preserved, no doubt, as an example of</p>

 <p>It floats about, that boat of cypress wood, There by the side of the Ho. With his two tufts of hair falling over his forehead, He was my only one; And I swear that till death I will not do the evil thing. O mother, O Heaven, Why will you not understand me?</p>

 <p><a name="fn_600"></a><a href="sbe03161.htm#fr_620">435:1</a> These allusive lines, probably, indicate the speaker's widowhood, Which left her like 'a boat floating about on the water.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_601"></a><a href="sbe03161.htm#fr_621">435:2</a> Such was the mode in which the hair was kept, while a boy or young man's parents were alive, parted into two tufts from the pia mater, and brought down as low as the eyebrows on either side of the forehead.</p>

There seems rather to be in the term a wild, and not very intelligent, appeal to the supreme Power in heaven.</p>
