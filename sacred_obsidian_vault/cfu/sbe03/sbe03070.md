They belong mostly to the time of king Wăn, the founder of the <i>K</i>âu dynasty, and to the reigns of his son and grandson, kings Wû and <i>Kh</i>ăng. The decades are named from the name of the first piece in each.</p>  <h4 align="center">The First Decade, or that of <i>Kh</i>ing Miâo.</h4>  <h5 align="center">ODE 1.
