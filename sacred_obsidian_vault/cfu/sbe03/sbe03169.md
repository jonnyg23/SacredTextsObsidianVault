   <h3 align="center">BOOK X. THE ODES OF THANG.</h3>  
 <p>THE odes of Thang were really the odes of Ȝin, the greatest of the fiefs of <i>K</i>âu until the rise of <i>Kh</i>in. King <i>Kh</i>ăng, in B.C. 1107, invested his younger brother, called Shû-yü, with the territory where Yâo was supposed to have ruled anciently as the marquis of Thang, in the present department of Thâi-yüan, Shan-hsî, the fief retaining that ancient name. Subsequently the name of the state was changed to Ȝin, from the river Ȝin in the southern part of it.</p>
