 <p><font size="-1">THE Books of Yü is the name of this Part of the Shû Yü being the dynastic designation of Shun, as Thang was that of Yâo. It does not appear so clearly, however, how it came to be so. Yü must be the name of a state, and is commonly identified with the present district of An-yî, in <i>K</i>ieh <i>K</i>âu, Shan-hsî. Some think that Yâo, after marrying his two daughters to Shun, appointed him lord of this state; but in the first mention of him to Yâo in the last Book, he is called Shun of Yü. It is. generally said that Shun's ancestors had been lords of the principality of Yü up to the time of his father, who lost his patrimony and was reduced to the rank of a private man. But after what has been said, in the Introduction, on the Books in the first two Parts of the Shû, it will not be thought surprising that much in the accounts about Yâo and Shun should be open to suspicion. According to Mencius, IV, Part ii, ch. 1, Shun was from the country of the wild tribes on the east. Sze-mâ <i>Kh</i>ien makes him to have been descended from Hwang-Tî, in which case he and his wives, the daughters of Yâo, would have had the same ancestor. Nothing more injurious to the fame of Yâo and Shun, according to Chinese notions of propriety, could be alleged against them.</font></p>  
 <p>Shun is the subject of this Canon, as Yâo was of the former. As it now stands, we may divide it into six chapters:--the first, describing Shun's virtues and gradual advancement; the second, Yâo's satisfaction with his administration of affairs, and associating of Shun with himself on the throne; the third, the acts of Shun in that position; the fourth, the demise of Yâo, and Shun's accession as sole monarch; the fifth, his choice of ministers and complete organization of his government; and the sixth, his death.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>1. Examining into antiquity, (we find that) the Tî Shun <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">1</font></a> was styled <i>Kh</i>ung-hwâ <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">2</font></a>. His character was entirely conformed to (that of): the (former) Tî, he was profound, wise, accomplished, and intelligent. He was mild and courteous, and truly sincere. The report of his mysterious virtue was heard on high, and he was appointed to office.</p>  
 <p>2. (Shun) carefully set forth the beauty of the five cardinal duties, and they came to be (universally) observed. Being appointed to be General Regulator, the affairs of every (official) department were arranged in their proper seasons. (Being charged) to receive (the princes) from the four quarters of the land, they were all docilely submissive. Being sent to the great plains at the foot of the mountains, notwithstanding the tempests of wind, thunder, and rain, he did not go astray.</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Come, you Shun. I have consulted you on (all) affairs, and examined your words, and found that they can be carried into practice;--(now) for three years. Do you ascend the seat of the Tî.' Shun wished to decline in favour of some one more virtuous, and not to consent to be (Yâo's) successor. On the first day of the first month, (however), he received (Yâo's) retirement (from his duties) in the temple of the Accomplished Ancestor <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">3</font></a>.*</p>  
 <p>3. He examined the pearl-adorned turning sphere,</p>

 </p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>with its transverse tube of jade, and reduced to a harmonious system (the movements of) the Seven Directors <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>Thereafter, he sacrificed specially, but with the ordinary forms, to God; sacrificed with reverent purity to the Six Honoured Ones; offered their appropriate sacrifices to the hills and rivers; and extended his worship to the host of spirits <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">2</font></a>.*</p>  
 <p>He called in (all) the five jade-symbols of rank; and when the month was over, he gave daily audience to (the President of) the Four Mountains, and all the Pastors <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">3</font></a>, (finally) returning their symbols to the various princes.</p>  
 <p>In the second month of the year he made a tour of inspection eastwards, as far as Thâi-ȝung <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">4</font></a>, where he presented a burnt-offering to Heaven, and sacrificed in order to the hills and rivers.* Thereafter he gave audience to the princes of the east. He set in accord their seasons and months, and regulated the days; he made uniform the standard-tubes, with the measures of length and of capacity, and the steelyards, he regulated the five (classes of) ceremonies, with (the various) articles of introduction,--the five</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>symbols of jade, the three kinds of silk, the two living (animals) and the one dead one. As to the five instruments of rank, when all was over, he returned them. In the fifth month he made a similar tour southwards, as far as the mountain of the south <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a>, where he observed the same ceremonies as at Thâi. In the eighth month he made a tour westwards, as far as the mountain of the west <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a>, where he did as before. In the eleventh month he made a tour northwards, as far as the mountain of the north', where he observed the same ceremonies as in the west. He (then) returned (to the capital), went to (the temple of) the Cultivated Ancestor <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and sacrificed a single bull.*</p>  
 <p>In five years there was one tour of inspection, and there were four appearances of the princes at court. They gave a report (of their government) in words, which was clearly tested by their works. They received chariots and robes according to their merits.</p>  
 <p>He instituted the division (of the land) into twelve provinces <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">3</font></a>, raising altars upon twelve hills in them.* He (also) deepened the rivers.</p>  
 <p>He exhibited (to the people) the statutory punishments, enacting banishment as a mitigation of the five (great) inflictions <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">4</font></a>; with the whip to be employed in the magistrates' courts, the stick to be</p>  
 <p>

 <p>employed in schools <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and money to be received for redeemable offences. Inadvertent offences and those which could be ascribed to misfortune were to be pardoned, but those who transgressed presumptuously and repeatedly were to be punished with death. 'Let me be reverent! Let me be reverent!' (he said to himself.) 'Let compassion rule in punishment!'</p>  
 <p>He banished the Minister of Works to Yû island; confined Hwan-tâu on mount <i>Kh</i>ung; drove (the chief of) San-miâo (and his people) into San-wei, and kept them there; and held Khwăn a prisoner till death on mount Yü. These four criminals being thus dealt with, all under heaven acknowledged the justice (of Shun's administration) <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>4. After twenty-eight years the Tî deceased, when the people mourned for him as for a parent for three years. Within the four seas all the eight kinds of instruments of music were stopped and hushed. On the first day of the first month (of the) next year, Shun went to (the temple of) the Accomplished Ancestor.*</p>  
 <p>
 
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. He deliberated with (the President of) the Four Mountains how to throw open the doors (of communication between himself and the) four (quarters of the land), and how he could see with the eyes, and hear with the ears of all.</p>  
 <p>He consulted with the twelve Pastors <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and said to them, 'The food!--it depends on observing the seasons. Be kind to the distant, and cultivate the ability of the near. Give honour to the virtuous, and your confidence to the good, while you discountenance the artful;--so shall the barbarous tribes lead on one another to make their submission.'</p>  
 <p>Shun said, 'Ho! (President of) the Four Mountains, is there any one who can with vigorous service attend to all the affairs of the Tî, whom I may appoint to be General Regulator, to assist me in (all) affairs, managing each department according to its nature?' All (in the court) replied, 'There is Po-yü <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Minister of Works.' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! Yü, you have regulated the water and the land. In this (new office) exert yourself.' Yü did obeisance with his head to the ground, and wished to decline in favour of the Minister of Agriculture, or Hsieh, or Kâo-yâo. The Tî said, 'Yes, but do you go (and undertake the duties).'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, '<i>Kh</i>î <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">3</font></a>, the black-haired people are (still) suffering from famine. Do you, O prince, as</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Minister of Agriculture, (continue to) sow (for them) the various kinds of grain.'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Hsieh <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the people are (still) wanting in affection for one another, and do not docilely, observe the five orders of relationship. It is yours, as the Minister of Instruction, reverently, to set forth the lessons of duty belonging to those five orders. Do so with gentleness.'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Kâo-yâo <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the barbarous tribes trouble our great land. There are (also) robbers, murderers, insurgents, and traitors. It is yours, as the Minister of Crime, to use the five punishments to deal with their offences. For the infliction of these there are the three appointed places. There are the five cases in which banishment in the appropriate places is to be resorted to, to which places, though five, three localities are assigned. Perform your duties with intelligence, and you will secure a sincere (submission).'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Who can superintend my works, as they severally require?' All (in the court) replied, 'Is there not <i>Z</i>ui <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">3</font></a>?' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! <i>Z</i>ui, you must be Minister of Works.' <i>Z</i>ui did obeisance with his head to the ground, and wished to decline in favour of Shû, <i>Kh</i>iang, or Po-yü. The</p>

 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Tî said, 'Yes, but do you go (and undertake the duties). Effect a harmony (in all the departments).' The Tî said, 'Who can superintend, as the nature of the charge requires, the grass and trees, with the birds and beasts on my hills and in my marshes?' All (in the court) replied, 'Is there not Yî <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a>?' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! Yî do you be my Forester.' Yî did obeisance with his head to the ground, and wished to decline in favour of <i>K</i>û, Hû, Hsiung, or Pî <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The Tî said, 'Yes, but do you go (and undertake the duties). You must manage them harmoniously.'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Ho! (President of the) Four Mountains, is there any one able to direct my three (religious) ceremonies <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">2</font></a>?' All (In the court) answered, 'Is there not Po-î <a name="fr_56"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">3</font></a>?' The Tî said, 'Yes. Ho! Po, you must be the Arranger in the Ancestral Temple. Morning and night be reverent. Be upright, be pure.' Po did obeisance with his head to the ground, and wished to decline in favour of Khwei or Lung. The Tî said, 'Yes, but do you go (and undertake the duties). Be reverential!'*</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Khwei <a name="fr_57"></a><a href="#fn_55"><font size="1">4</font></a>, I appoint you to be Director of Music, and to teach our sons, so that the straightforward shall yet be mild; the gentle, dignified: the strong, not tyrannical: and the impetuous,</p>

 <p>not arrogant. Poetry is the expression of earnest thought; singing is the prolonged utterance of that expression; the notes accompany that utterance, and they are harmonized themselves by the standard tubes. (In this way) the eight different kinds of musical instruments can be adjusted so that one shall not take from or interfere with another; and spirits and men are brought into harmony.' Khwei said, 'I smite the (sounding-) stone, I gently strike it, and the various animals lead on one another to dance.'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said ; 'Lung <a name="fr_58"></a><a href="#fn_56"><font size="1">1</font></a>, I abominate slanderous speakers and destroyers of the (right) ways, who agitate and alarm my people. I appoint you to be the Minister of Communication. Early and late give forth my orders and report to me, seeing that everything is true.'</p>  
 <p>The Tî said, 'Ho! you, twenty and two men, be reverent; so shall you. be helpful to the business (entrusted to me by) Heaven.'*</p>  
 <p>Every three years there was an examination of merits, and after three examinations the undeserving were degraded, and the deserving advanced. (By this arrangement) the duties of all the departments were fully discharged; the (people of) San-miâo (also) were discriminated and separated.</p>  
 <p>6. In the thirtieth year of his age, Shun was called to employment. Thirty years he was on the throne (with Yâo). Fifty years afterwards he went on high and died <a name="fr_59"></a><a href="#fn_57"><font size="1">2</font></a>.*</p>

An-kwo thought they were, 'the seasons, cold and heat, the sun, the moon, the stars, and drought,' that is, certain spirits, supposed to rule over these phenomena and things, and residing probably in different stars.

 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_43">40:3</a> As Yü, according to Part III, i, divided the land into nine provinces, this division of it into twelve must have been subsequent to the completion of Yü's work. See on the Tribute of Yü.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_43"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_44">40:4</a> Those five great inflictions were-branding on the forehead; cutting off the nose; cutting off the feet; castration; and death, inflicted in various ways.</p>

 </p><p><a name="fn_45"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_46">41:2</a> The Minister of Works, Hwan-tâu, and Khwăn are mentioned in the former Canon. Yû island, or Yû <i>K</i>âu, was in the extreme north of the present district of Mî-yun, department Shun-thien, <i>K</i>ih-lî.</p>  
 <p>Mount Khung was in the district of Yung-ting, Lî <i>K</i>âu, Hu-nan. San-miâo was the name of a territory, embracing the present departments of Wû-<i>kh</i>ang in Hû-pei, Yo-<i>k</i>âu in Hu-nan, and <i>K</i>iû-kiang in <i>K</i>iang-hsî. San-wei was a tract of country round a mountain of the same name in the present department of An-hsî, Kan-sû. Mount Yü was in the present district of Than-<i>kh</i>ăng, Shan-tung.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_47"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_48">42:2</a> Po-yü is the great Yü, the founder of the Hsiâ dynasty. Po denotes, probably, his order as the eldest among his brothers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_48"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_49">42:3</a> <i>Kh</i>î was the name of the Minister of Agriculture, better known in the Shih and other books as Hû-<i>k</i>î, the progenitor of the kings of <i>K</i>âu. See the legend about him in the Shih, Part III, ii, Ode 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_49"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_50">43:1</a> Hsieh was honoured by the kings of the Shang dynasty as their progenitor. See the Shih, Part IV, iii, Odes 3 and 4.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_51"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_52">43:3</a> <i>Z</i>ui was not claimed by any great family as its progenitor, but he was handed down by tradition as a great artificer. See a reference to him in Part V, xxii, 2. Shû and <i>Kh</i>iang must have been named from their skill in making halberds and axes. The Yü (quite different from the name of the great Yü) in Po-yü gives us no indication of the skill of that individual.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_52"></a><a href="sbe03009.htm#fr_54">44:1</a> For Yî, see the preliminary note to Book iv. He wishes here to decline his appointment in favour of <i>K</i>û ('The Cedar'), Hû ('The Tiger'), Hsiung ('The Bear'), or Pî ('The Grisly Bear').</p>
