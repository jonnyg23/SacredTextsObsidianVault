   <h4 align="center">ODE 6. THE SZE <i>K</i>ÂI.</h4>  <h4 align="center">THE VIRTUE OF WĂN, WITH HIS FILIAL PIETY AND CONSTANT REVERENCE, AND THEIR WONDERFUL EFFECTS. THE EXCELLENT CHARACTER OF HIS MOTHER AND WIFE.</h4>  
 <p>Pure and reverent was Thâi <i>Z</i>ăn <a name="fr_524"></a><a href="#fn_506"><font size="1">5</font></a>, The mother of king Wăn. Loving was she to <i>K</i>âu <i>K</i>iang <a name="fr_525"></a><a href="#fn_507"><font size="1">6</font></a>;--</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> A wife becoming the House of <i>K</i>âu. Thâi Sze <a name="fr_526"></a><a href="#fn_508"><font size="1">1</font></a> inherited her excellent fame, And from her came a hundred sons <a name="fr_527"></a><a href="#fn_509"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>He conformed to the example of his ancestors, And their spirits had no occasion for complaint. Their spirits had no occasion for dissatisfaction; And his example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and states.</p>  
 <p>Full of harmony was he in his palace; Full of reverence in the ancestral temple. Unseen (by men), he still felt that he was under inspection <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_510"><font size="1">3</font></a>: Unweariedly he maintained his virtue.</p>  
 <p>Though he could not prevent (some) great calamities, His brightness and magnanimity were without stain. Without previous instruction he did what was right; Without admonition he went on (in the path of goodness).</p>  
 <p>So, grown up men became virtuous (through him), And young men made (constant) attainments. (Our) ancient prince never felt weariness, And from him were the fame and eminence of his officers.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_509"></a><a href="sbe03132.htm#fr_527">388:2</a> We are not to suppose that Thâi Sze had herself a hundred sons. She had ten, and her freedom from jealousy so encouraged the fruitfulness of the harem, that all the sons born in it are ascribed to her.</p>
