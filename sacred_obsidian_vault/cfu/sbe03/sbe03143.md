   <h4 align="center">ODE 10. THE PAN.</h4>  <h4>AN OFFICER OF EXPERIENCE MOURNS OVER THE PREVAILING MISERY; COMPLAINS OF THE WANT OF SYMPATHY WITH HIM SHOWN BY OTHER OFFICERS; ADMONISHES THEM, AND SETS FORTH THE DUTY REQUIRED OF THEM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ANGRY MOOD IN WHICH IT MIGHT SEEM THAT HEAVEN WAS.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">This piece, like the last, is assigned to the time of king Lî.</font></p>  
 <p>God has reversed (his usual course of procedure) <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">1</font></a>, And the lower people are full of distress. The words which you utter are not right; The plans which you form are not far-reaching. As there are not sages, you think you have no guidance;--You have no real sincerity. (Thus) your plans do not reach far, And I therefore strongly admonish you.</p>  
 <p>Heaven is now sending down calamities;--Do not be so complacent. Heaven is now producing such movements;--Do not be so indifferent. If your words were harmonious, The people would become united. If your words were gentle and kind, The people would be settled.</p>  
 <p>Though my duties are different from yours, I am your fellow-servant. I come to advise with you, And you hear me with contemptuous indifference, My words are about the (present urgent) affairs;--Do not think them matter for laughter. The ancients had a saying:--'Consult the gatherers of grass and firewood <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">2</font></a>.'</p>

 <p>Heaven is now exercising oppression;--Do not in such a way make a mock of things. An old man, (I speak) with entire sincerity; But you, my juniors, are full of pride. It is not that my words are those of age, But you make a joke of what is sad. But the troubles will multiply like flames, Till they are beyond help or remedy.</p>  
 <p>Heaven is now displaying its anger;--Do not be either boastful or flattering, Utterly departing from all propriety of demeanour, Till good men are reduced to personators of the dead <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The people now sigh and groan, And we dare not examine (into the causes of their trouble). The ruin and disorder are exhausting all their means of living, And we show no kindness to our multitudes.</p>  
 <p>Heaven enlightens the people <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">2</font></a>, As the bamboo flute responds to the earthen whistle; As two half-maces form a whole one; As you take a thing, and bring it away in your hand, Bringing it away, without any more ado. The enlightenment of the people is very easy. They have (now) many perversities;--Do not you set up your perversity before them.</p>  
 <p>Good men are a fence; The multitudes of the people are a wall; Great states are screens; Great families are buttresses;--The cherishing of virtue</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_410"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 410</font></a></p>  
 <p>secures repose; The circle of (the king's) relatives is a fortified wall. We must not let the fortified wall get destroyed; We must not let (the king) be solitary and consumed with terrors.</p>  
 <p>Revere the anger of Heaven, And presume not to make sport or be idle. Revere the changing moods of Heaven, And presume not to drive about (at your pleasure). Great Heaven is intelligent, And is with you in all your goings. Great Heaven is clear-seeing, And is with you in your wanderings and indulgences.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_550"></a><a href="sbe03143.htm#fr_570">408:1</a> The proof of God's having reversed his usual course of procedure was to be found in the universal misery of the people, whose good He was understood to desire, and for the securing of which government by righteous kings was maintained by him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_551"></a><a href="sbe03143.htm#fr_571">408:2</a> If ancient worthies thought that persons in such mean employments were to he consulted surely, the advice of the writer deserved to be taken into account by his comrades.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe03143.htm#fr_572">409:1</a> During all the time of the sacrifice, the personators of the dead said not a word, but only ate and drank. To the semblance of them good men were now reduced.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="sbe03143.htm#fr_573">409:2</a> The meaning is, that Heaven has so attuned the mind to virtue, that, if good example were set before the people, they would certainly and readily follow it. This is illustrated by various instances of things, in which the one succeeded the other freely and as it necessarily; so that government by virtue was really very easy.</p>
