   <h4 align="center">ODE 4. THE HÛ Î.</h4>  <h4 align="center">AN ODE APPROPRIATE TO THE FEAST GIVEN TO THE PERSONATORS OF THE DEPARTED, ON THE DAY AFTER THE SACRIFICE IN THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLE.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">This supplementary sacrifice on the day after the principal service in the temple appeared in the ninth Book of the fourth Part of the Shû; and of the feast after it to the personators of the dead I have spoken on <a href="sbe03063.htm#page_301">p. 301</a>.</font></p>  
 <p>The wild-ducks and widgeons are on the <i>K</i>ing <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_546"><font size="1">3</font></a>;</p>

 <p><a name="page_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The personators of your ancestors feast and are happy. Your spirits are clear; Your viands are fragrant. The personators of your ancestors feast and drink;--Their happiness and dignity are made complete.</p>  
 <p>The wild-ducks and widgeons are on the sand; The personators of the dead enjoy the feast, their appropriate tribute. Your spirits are abundant; Your viands are good. The personators of your ancestors feast and drink;--Happiness and dignity lend them their aids.</p>  
 <p>The wild-ducks and widgeons are on the islets; The personators of your ancestors feast and enjoy themselves. Your spirits are strained; Your viands are in slices. The personators of your ancestors feast and drink;--Happiness and dignity descend on them.</p>  
 <p>The wild-ducks and widgeons are where the waters meet; The personators of your ancestors feast and are honoured. The feast is spread in the ancestral temple. The place where happiness and dignity descend. The personators of your ancestors feast and drink;--Their happiness and dignity are at the highest point.</p>  
 <p>The wild-ducks and widgeons are in the gorge; The personators of your ancestors rest, full of complacency. The fine spirits are delicious; Your meat, roast and broiled, is fragrant. The personators of your ancestors feast and drink;--No troubles will be theirs after this.</p>

The birds, feeling at home in its waters, on its sands, &amp;c., serve to introduce the parties feasted, in a situation where they might relax from the gravity of the preceding day, and be happy.</p>
