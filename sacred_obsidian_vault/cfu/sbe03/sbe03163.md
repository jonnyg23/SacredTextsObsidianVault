 <p><font size="-1">The state of Wei was reduced to extremity by an irruption of some northern hordes in B.C. 660, and had nearly disappeared from among the states of <i>K</i>âu. Under the marquis Wei, known in history as duke Wăn, its fortunes revived, and he became a sort of second founder of the state.</font></p>

 <p>its aspects by means of the sun. He built the palace at Khû. He planted about it hazel and chesnut trees, The Î, the Thung, the Ȝze, and the varnish tree. Which, when cut down, might afford materials for lutes.</p>  
 <p>He ascended those old walls, And thence surveyed (the site of) <i>Kh</i>û. He surveyed <i>Kh</i>û and Thang <a name="fr_627"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">1</font></a>, With the lofty hills and high elevations about. He descended and examined the mulberry trees. He then divined by the tortoise-shell, and got a favourable response <a name="fr_628"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">2</font></a>; And thus the issue has been truly good.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_605"></a><a href="sbe03163.htm#fr_625">436:3</a> Ting is the name of a small space in the heavens, embracing α Markab and another star of Pegasus. Its culminating at night-fall was the signal that the labours of husbandry were over for the year, and that building operations should be taken in hand. Great as was the urgency for the building of his new capital, duke Wăn would not take it in hand till the proper time for such a labour was arrived.</p>
