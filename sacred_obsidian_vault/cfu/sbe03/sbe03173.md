   <h4 align="center">ODE 6, STANZA 1. THE HWANG NIÂO.</h4>  <h4 align="center">LAMENT FOR THREE WORTHIES OF <i>KH</i>IN, WHO WERE BURIED IN THE SAME GRAVE WITH DUKE MÛ.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">There is no difficulty or difference in the interpretation of this piece; and it brings us down to B.C. 621. Then died duke Mû, after playing an important part in the north-west of China for thirty-nine years. The Ȝo <i>K</i>wan, under the sixth year of duke Wan, makes mention of Mû's requiring that the three brothers here celebrated should be buried with him, and of the composition of this piece in consequence. Sze-mâ <i>Kh</i>ien says that this barbarous practice began with Mû's predecessor, with whom sixty-six persons were buried alive, and that one hundred and seventy-seven in all were buried with Mû. The death of the last distinguished man of the House of <i>Kh</i>in, the emperor I, was subsequently celebrated by the entombment with him of all the inmates of his harem.</font></p>

 <p><a name="fn_621"></a><a href="sbe03173.htm#fr_641">443:1</a> It is difficult to see the relation between these two allusive lines and the rest of the stanza. Some say that it is this,--that the people loved the three victims as they liked the birds; others that the birds among the trees were in their proper place,--very different from the brothers in the grave of duke Mû.</p>
