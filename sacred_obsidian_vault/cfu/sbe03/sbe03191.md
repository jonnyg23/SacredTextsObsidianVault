   <h2 align="center">CHAPTER XI. FILIAL PIETY IN RELATION TO THE FIVE PUNISHMENTS.</h2>  
 <p>The Master said, 'There are three thousand offences against which the five punishments are directed <a name="fr_686"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and there is not one of them greater than being unfilial.</p>  
 <p>'When constraint is put upon a ruler, that is the disowning of his superiority; when the authority of the sages is disallowed, that is the disowning of (all) law; when filial piety is put aside, that is the disowning of the principle of affection. These (three things) pave the way to anarchy.'</p>
