 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">When</span> the sun rose I was still lying in bed;<br> An early oriole sang on the roof of my house.<br> For a moment I thought of the Royal Park at dawn<br> When the Birds of Spring greeted their Lord from his trees.<br> I remembered the days when I served before the Throne<br> Pencil in hand, on duty at the Ch‘ēng-ming; <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> At the height of spring, when I paused an instant from work,<br> Morning and evening, was <i>this</i> the voice I heard?<br> Now in my exile the oriole sings again<br> In the dreary stillness of Hsün-yang town…<br> The bird's note cannot really have changed;<br> All the difference lies in the listener's heart.<br> If he could but forget that he lives at the World's end,<br> The bird would sing as it sang in the Palace of old.</p>
