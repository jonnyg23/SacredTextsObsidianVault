 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> an idle hour I thought of former days;<br> And former friends seemed to be standing in the room.<br> And then I wondered "Where are they now?"<br> Like fallen leaves they have tumbled to the Nether Springs.<br> Han Yü <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a> swallowed his sulphur pills,<br> Yet a single illness carried him straight to the grave.<br> Yüan Chēn smelted autumn stone <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">2</font></a><br> But before he was old, his strength crumbled away.<br> Master Tu possessed the "Secret of Health":<br> All day long he fasted from meat and spice.<br> The Lord Ts‘ui, trusting a strong drug,<br> Through the whole winter wore his summer coat.<br> Yet some by illness and some by sudden death…<br> All vanished ere their middle years were passed.</p>  
 <p>Only I, who have never dieted myself<br> Have thus protracted a tedious span of age,<br>     I who in young days<br> Yielded lightly to every lust and greed;<br> Whose palate craved only for the richest meat<br> And knew nothing of bismuth or calomel.<br> When hunger came, I gulped steaming food;<br> When thirst came, I drank from the frozen stream.</p>

 <p>With verse I served the spirits of my Five Guts; <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> With wine I watered the three Vital Spots.<br> Day by day joining the broken clod<br> I have lived till now almost sound and whole.<br> There is no gap in my two rows of teeth;<br> Limbs and body still serve me well.<br> Already I have opened the seventh book of years;<br> Yet I eat my fill and sleep quietly;<br> I drink, while I may, the wine that lies in my cup,<br> And all else commit to Heaven's care.</p>
