 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> length of days and soundness of limb you and I are one;<br> Our eyes are not wholly blind, nor our ears quite deaf.<br> Deep drinking we lie together, fellows of a spring day;<br> Or gay-hearted boldly break into gatherings of young men.<br> When, seeking flowers, we borrowed his horse, the river-keeper was vexed;<br> When, to play on the water, we stole his boat, the Duke Ling was sore.<br> I hear it said that in Lo-yang, people are all shocked,<br> And call us by the name of "Liu and Po, those two mad old men."</p>
