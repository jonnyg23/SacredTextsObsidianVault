 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From</span> my high castle I look at the town below<br> Where the natives of Pa cluster like a swarm of flies.<br> How can I govern these people and lead them aright?<br> I cannot even understand what they say.<br> But at least I am glad, now that the taxes are in,<br> To learn that in my province there is no discontent.<br> I fear its prosperity is not due to me<br> And was only caused by the year's abundant crops,<br> The papers that lie on my desk are simple and few;<br> My house by the moat is leisurely and still.<br> In the autumn rain the berries fall from the eaves;<br> At the evening bell the birds return to the wood.<br> A broken sunlight quavers over the southern porch<br> Where I lie on my couch abandoned to idleness.</p>
