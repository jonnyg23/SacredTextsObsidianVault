 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I have</span> got patronage, but am too lazy to use it;<br> I have got land, but am too lazy to farm it.<br> My house leaks; I am too lazy to mend it.<br> My clothes are torn; I am too lazy to darn them.<br> I have got wine, but am too lazy to drink;<br> So it's just the same as if my cellar were empty.<br> I have got a harp, but am too lazy to play;<br> So it's just the same as if it had no strings.<br> My wife tells me there is no more bread in the house;<br> I want to bake, but am too lazy to grind.<br> My friends and relatives write me long letters;<br> I should like to read them, but they're such a bother to open.<br> I have always been told that Chi Shu-yeh <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">1</font></a><br> Passed his whole life in absolute idleness.<br> But he played the harp and sometimes transmuted metals,<br> So even <i>he</i> was not so lazy as I.</p>
