 <p><a name="fn_25"></a><a href="mtc40.htm#fr_27">70:1</a> "The Emperor Saga of Japan (reigned A. D. 810-23) one day quoted to his Minister, Ono no Takamura, the couplet:</p>  
 <p>"Through my closed doors I hear nothing but the morning and evening drum;<br> From my upper windows in the distance I see ships that come and go."</p>  
 <p>Takamura, thinking these were the Emperor's own verses, said: "If I may venture to criticize an august composition, I would suggest that the phrase "in the distance" be altered." The Emperor was delighted, for he had purposely changed "all I see" to "in the distance I see." At that time there was only one copy of Po Chü-i's poems in Japan and the Emperor, to whom it belonged, had allowed no one to see it."—From the <i>Kōdanshō</i> (twelfth century).</p>
