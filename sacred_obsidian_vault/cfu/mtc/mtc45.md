 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">We</span> had rode long and were still far from the inn;<br> My eyes grew dim; for a moment I fell asleep.<br> Under my right arm the whip still dangled;<br> In my left hand the reins for an instant slackened.<br> Suddenly I woke and turned to question my groom:<br> "We have gone a hundred paces since you fell asleep,"<br> Body and spirit for a while had exchanged place;<br> Swift and slow had turned to their contraries.<br> For these few steps that my horse had carried me<br> Had taken in my dream countless aeons of time!<br> True indeed is that saying of Wise Men<br> "A hundred years are but a moment of sleep."</p>
