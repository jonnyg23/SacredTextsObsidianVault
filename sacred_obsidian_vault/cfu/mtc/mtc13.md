 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">At</span> dawn I rode to escort the Doctors of Art;<br> In the eastern quarter the sky was still grey.<br> I said to myself, "You have started far too soon,"<br> But horses and coaches already thronged the road.<br> High and low the riders' torches bobbed;<br> Muffled or loud, the watchman's drum beat.<br> Riders, when I see you prick<br> To your early levee, pity fills my heart.<br> When the sun rises and the hot dust flies<br> And the creatures of earth resume their great strife,<br> You, with your striving, what shall you each seek?<br> Profit and fame, for that is all your care.<br> But I, you courtiers, rise from my bed at noon<br> And live idly in the city of Ch‘ang-an.<br> Spring is deep and my term of office spent;<br> Day by day my thoughts go back to the hills.</p>
