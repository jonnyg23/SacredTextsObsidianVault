 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">We</span> are growing old together, you and I,<br> Let us ask ourselves, what is age like?<br> The dull eye is closed ere night comes;<br> The idle head, still uncombed at noon.<br> Propped on a staff, sometimes a walk abroad;<br> Or all day sitting with closed doors.<br> One dares not look in the mirror's polished face;<br> One cannot read small-letter books.<br> Deeper and deeper, one's love of old friends;<br> Fewer and fewer, one's dealings with young men.<br> One thing only, the pleasure of idle talk,<br> Is great as ever, when you and I meet.</p>
