 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tillers</span> of the soil have few idle months;<br> In the fifth month their toil is double-fold.<br> A south-wind visits the fields at night:<br> Suddenly the hill is covered with yellow corn.<br> Wives and daughters shoulder baskets of rice;<br> Youths and boys carry the flasks of wine.<br> Following after they bring a wage of meat<br> To the strong reapers toiling on the southern hill,<br> Whose feet are burned by the hot earth they tread,<br> Whose backs are scorched by flames of the shining sky.<br> Tired they toil, caring nothing for the heat,<br> Grudging the shortness of the long summer day.<br> A poor woman follows at the reapers' side<br> With an infant child carried close at her breast.<br> With her right hand she gleans the fallen grain;<br> On her left arm a broken basket hangs.<br> And <i>I</i> to-day… by virtue of what right<br> Have I never once tended field or tree?<br> My government-pay is three hundred tons;<br> At the year's end I have still grain in hand.<br> Thinking of this, secretly I grew ashamed;<br> And all day the thought lingered in my head.</p>
