 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I dismount</span> from my horse at the Hsi-lin Temple;<br> I throw the porter my slender riding-whip.<br> In the morning I work at a Government office-desk;<br> In the evening I become a dweller in the Sacred Hills.<br> In the second month to the north of Kuang-lu<br> The ice breaks and the snow begins to melt.<br> On the southern plantation the tea-plant thrusts its sprouts;<br> Through the northern sluice the veins of the spring ooze.</p>  
 <p>This year there is war in An-hui,<br> In every place soldiers are rushing to arms.<br> Men of learning have been summoned to the Council Board;<br> Men of action are marching to the battle-line.<br> Only I, who have no talents at all,<br> Am left in the mountains to play with the pebbles of the stream.</p>
