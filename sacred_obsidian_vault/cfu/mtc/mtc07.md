 <p>"<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Life</span> in the World is but a big dream;<br> I will not spoil it by any labour or care."<br> So saying, I was drunk all the day,<br> Lying helpless at the porch in front of my door.<br> When I woke up, I blinked at the garden-lawn;<br> A lonely bird was singing amid the flowers.<br> I asked myself, had the day been wet or fine?<br> The Spring wind was telling the mango-bird.<br> Moved by its song I soon began to sigh,<br> And as wine was there I filled my own cup.<br> Wildly singing I waited for the moon to rise;<br> When my song was over, all my senses had gone.</p>
