 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> early summer, with two or three more<br> That were seeking fame in the city of Ch‘ang-an,<br> Whose low employ gave them less business<br> Than ever they had since first they left their homes,—<br> With these I wandered deep into the shrine of Tao,<br> For the joy we sought was promised in this place.<br> When we reached the gate, we sent our coaches back;<br> We entered the yard with only cap and stick.<br> Still and clear, the first weeks of May,<br> When trees are green and bushes soft and wet;<br> When the wind has stolen the shadows of new leaves<br> And birds linger on the last boughs that bloom.<br> Towards evening when the sky grew clearer yet<br> And the South-east was still clothed in red,<br> To the western cloister we carried our jar of wine;<br> While we waited for the moon, our cups moved slow.<br> Soon, how soon her golden ghost was born,<br> Swiftly, as though she had waited for us to come.<br> The beams of her light shone in every place,<br> On towers and halls dancing to and fro.<br> Till day broke we sat in her clear light<br> Laughing and singing, and yet never grew tired.<br> In Ch‘ang-an, the place of profit and fame, <br> Such moods as this, how many men know?</p>
