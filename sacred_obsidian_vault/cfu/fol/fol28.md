 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Death would have ravished her some hapless day<br> Even among the palaces of Han,<br> But she was never born to taste<br> The bitterness of fate so far away—<br> This pearl of beauty for whose sake did haste<br> The camels' golden-gleaming caravan.<br> To-day but dust and bones remain<br> Of her whose ransom threaded the cold steppes in vain.  
 <p>Night fell on chariots to the frontier ranged,<br> But horses champed, for none were fain to part.<br> Each cursed the lying hand, the traitor's heart.<br> The moon surprised us scattered round the tomb,<br> And all our tears were changed<br> To little piteous lights that ringed the gloom.</p></div>
