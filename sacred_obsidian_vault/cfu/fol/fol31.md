 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">One</span> of the greatest statesmen that China has produced. Po Chü-i comes nearer to our idea of a poet of the Romantic School than most Chinese writers. Yet even when he tells the story of the Emperor Ming Huang and the Lady Yang Kwei-fei—the one supreme love romance of China—he deals with issues that endure beyond the curtain-fall on tragedy. For him the final crisis is never attained. A wrong done has results beyond the reach of time. For a fuller account of this poet cf. <i>A Lute of Jade,</i> p. 73.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">IN YUNG-YANG</h3>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I was a child in Yung-yang,<br> A little child I waved farewell.<br> After long years again I dwell<br> In world-forgotten Yung-yang.<br> Yet I recall my play-time,<br> And in my dreams I see<br> The little ghosts of May-time<br> Waving farewell to me.  
 <p>My father's house in Yung-yang<br> Has fallen upon evil days.<br> No kinsmen o’er the crooked ways <br> Hail me as once in Yung-yang.</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">No longer stands the old Moot-hall,<br> Gone is the market from the town;<br> The very hills have tumbled down<br> And stoned the valleys in their fall.  
 <p>Only the waters of the Ch‘in and Wei<br> Roll green and changeless as in days gone by.</p>  
 <p>Yet I recall my play-time,<br> And in my dreams I see<br> The little ghosts of May-time<br> Waving farewell to me.</p></div>
