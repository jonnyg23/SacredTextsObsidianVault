 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A celebrated</span> poet and doctor who served two masters, the Emperor Ming Huang and the rebel general An Lu-Shan, and was eventually appointed governor of a province by the Emperor Su-tsung. It is recorded of An Lu-Shan that he once asked him what kind of animal a poet was, and what purpose he served. Wang Wei shortly afterwards had his revenge when, called upon to sing at a rebel banquet, he improvised verses in honour of his former patron Ming Huang.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">WHILE ROSES FALL</h3>
