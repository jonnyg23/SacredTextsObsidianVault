 <p>The east wind has returned. The green of the<br>       grass renews and I know that spring is here.<br> Streams unbound awake into the dance of life.<br> Softly the weeping willow waves its long slim<br>       boughs.<br> What sorrow is there in its movement!</p>  
 <p>Light of the sky, most fair, most tender blue!<br> Air of the sea, sweet-scented, fresh, green-tinged!<br> Bright colours on the emerald, dreaming off into<br>       the distance in a half-seen veil—such was the<br>       earth.<br> The little clouds hover lightly in the heights, each<br>       melting into the more radiant beyond.<br> Headlong waters are gathered in headlong streams.<br> My glance falls on the moss by the river-bend.<br>       How delicate and swift its movements in the<br>       wind!<br> Gauze of the wandering threads whirled here and<br>       there, my spirit is minded to escape and whirl <br>       along with you.<br> O air and light! I am drunk with you! I am<br>       dazed—and I am plunged in sorrow.</p>  
 <p>One who has hearkened to the waters roaring<br>       down from the heights of Lung, and faint<br>       voices from the land of Ch‘in; one who has<br>       listened to the cries of monkeys on the shores</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>      of the Yang-tse-Kiang, and the songs of the<br>       land of Pa; that renowned beauty Wang<br>       Chao-Chün, who saw before her the last<br>       jasper gate of her native land; that renowned<br>       Ch‘u poet singing the glories of the tinted<br>       maple wood—ah! these knew sorrow.<br> And if I ascend, and, mindful of them, look out<br>       across the blue horizon, I feel the keen pang<br>       of grief that, piercing through me, finds my <br>       heart.</p>  
 <p>The soul of man swells like a wave at the coming<br>       of spring.<br> But there is also the sadness of spring-time, which,<br>       like falling snow, distracts us.<br> Both sorrow and joy throbbing and pulsing—a<br>       countless crowd of feelings are stirred and<br>       mingle together in this festival of perfume.<br> What if I have a friend far away on the shores of<br>       the Hsiang! Clouds part us and hide us<br>       from each other.<br> Upon a little wave I shed the tears of separation,<br>       and—little wave going eastward, take to<br>       my friend my soul-felt love.<br> Oh! that I could grasp this golden light of<br>       spring, keep it and horde it—a treasure-trove<br>       of days for my fairest far-off friend.</p>
