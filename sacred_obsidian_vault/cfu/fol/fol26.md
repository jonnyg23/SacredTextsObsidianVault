 <p>Tsen-tsan and his brother delighted to dream in<br>    grand horizons,<br> They drew me down to the water's edge, their<br>    fellow wanderer.<br> Veiled was the sky and sombre the land, and<br>    sudden the change from daylight,<br> The wind rose and the storm-waves seemed to be<br>    rolling pale gems in the foam.</p>  
 <p>Our boat shot forth from its moorings and rippled<br>    into the movement,<br> Great was the scene, inspiring to song, but the<br>    dominant note was fear.</p>

 <p>How should I not be stirred with danger surging <br>    around me?<br> Treacherous wind and crested wave, is there no <br>    escaping you?</p>  
 <p>Lo now the captain unfurls the silken sail to the<br>    breezes<br> And the boatmen begin to rejoice as the last cloud<br>    flags away.<br> The wild-fowl rise with a roaring of wings, scared <br>    by the chant of oarsmen;<br> Lute and flute are astir; faint harmonies drip <br>    from the sky.</p>  
 <p>Bright are the water-lily's leaves as though the<br>    rains had burnished them.<br> The slack line slips through my hands that would<br>    fathom the soundless lake.<br> My gaze falls on the vast expanse of the limitless<br>    void before me,<br> Rearward menacing, dark, Chong-Nan towers out<br>    of sight.</p>  
 <p>Southward the mountains brood above the restless<br>    waters,<br> Their grim reflections, trembling, sink in deeps of<br>    darkening blue.<br> The sun sets, the boat glides by the<br>    cloud-pavilioned pagoda,<br> And soon the moon is mirrored in the dun dusk of<br>    the lake.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>’Tis then the black dragon, breathing pearls, looms<br>    out of the darkness.<br> ’Tis then the river-god beats the drum, and the<br>    shoaling monsters rise.<br> The naiads leave their dim retreats, faintly their<br>    revels find us,<br> And the pale streamers of their quickened lutes<br>    gleam for an instant far away.</p>
