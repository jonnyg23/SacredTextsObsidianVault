 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The rain's in the air<br> And the winds arouse,<br> Shaking the cinnamon boughs,<br> And the begonias' gay parterre;<br> Raising dust and wreathing mist,<br> Whirling all things where they list—<br> Leaves in many-coloured showers,<br> Bright petals of innumerable flowers.<br> Knocking at all doors their hustling<br> Sets the silken curtains rustling,<br> Till, as shrunken draughts, they creep<br> Into the shrouded halls of sleep,<br> Raise the hair and ruck the skin <br> Of the startled folk therein.  
 <p>I am grown weary of my lonely state,<br> Tired of the tongueless hours that wait,<br> Dreaming of her whom skies of blue<br> And twilight æons hid from view.</p></div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Swiftly the waters take their flight<br> Grandly the mountains rise,<br> Yon birds that taper to the skies<br> Why have they lost their plumage bright?<br> Would they might bear my messages of love!<br> Alas! the trackless heav’ns unroll above;<br> From west to east the river flows,<br> But the waves return not to my calling;<br> Once more the rare magnolia blows,<br> But hour by hour her flowers are falling.<br> My jasper lyre is laid apart,<br> Hushed for a while the lute of jade;<br> I hear the beating of my heart,<br> And watch the moon lean down the glade.  
 <p>Then, ere the shadows wane,<br> Out of the night's unrest<br> Ballad and old refrain<br> Lure me to seek again<br> The dream-built Isles of the Blest.</p></div>
