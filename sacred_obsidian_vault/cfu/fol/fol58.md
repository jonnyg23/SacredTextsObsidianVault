 <p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A native</span> of the province of Kiang-su, Yang Chi became a district magistrate and afterwards secretary to the Minister of War, by whom he was sent into the province of Shansi as Treasurer-General to the Forces. He suffered the fate of so many Chinese officials, being impeached and falsely accused and finally condemned to life-long exile, during which the following suggestive little poem was written.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">LINES WRITTEN IN EXILE</h3>  
 <p>As pure as autumn water falls the dew;<br> And cool of night is born when faintly sighs<br> The wind, that outcast of the twilight, dies,<br> And the green gloom of random grass anew<br> Covers the undulating shores. I see<br> Far out upon the lake an island gleaming<br> With a girdle of red nenuphar, and, dreaming,<br> I fill my sail o’ dreams in search of thee.<br> Cold eyes of strangers follow me, and fears<br> Start with the trumpet from the ramparts blown.<br> And on my darkened robes are sown<br> Two pearls, my tears.</p>
