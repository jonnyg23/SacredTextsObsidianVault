 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chêng Min;</i> narrative. Celebrating the virtues of Chung Shan-fu, who appears to have been one of the principal ministers of King Hsüan, and his dispatch to the east, to fortify the capital of the state of Ch‘i.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Heaven made the race of men, designed<br>   With nature good and large;<br> Functions of body, powers of mind,<br>   Their duties to discharge.<br> All men this normal nature own,<br> Its normal virtue all men crown<br>   With love sincere and true.<br> Heaven by our sovereign's course was moved, <a name="page_412"><font size="1" color="green">p. 412</font></a><br> And to aid him, its son approved,<br>   Gave birth to Chung Shan-fu.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Mild and admired, this chief displays<br>   Virtues that win the heart.<br> His air and looks a wondrous grace<br>   To all his ways impart.<br> His rule of life the ancient law,<br> To bear himself unmarred by flaw<br>   With earnest mind he aims.<br> In sympathy with our great Head,<br> Abroad the royal will to spread<br>   His constant service claims.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The king gave charge to Chung Shan-fu:—<br>   "Hear now what I direct.<br> As served your fathers, so serve you,<br>   And me, your king, protect.<br> Let all my lords your pattern see;<br> Publish among them each decree;<br>   Speak freely in my stead.<br> Of what goes on inform my mind. <a name="page_413"><font size="1" color="green">p. 413</font></a><br> Through you let all my measures find<br>   Obedience promptly paid."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Great was the charge. Our hero hears,<br>   And hastens to obey.<br> Among the princes he appears;<br>   Of each he marks the way.<br> Who good, who bad, throughout the land,<br> He clearly sees. With wisdom grand<br>   He guards his life and fame.<br> Nor day nor night he icily rests;<br> The king's, the one man's, high behests<br>   His soul with zeal inflame.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Among the people flies the word:<br>   "What's soft men swallow fast;<br> And what is for the teeth too hard<br>   Out of their mouths they cast."<br> But never yet did mortal trace<br> In Chung Shan such ignoble case;<br>   Nor soft nor hard he knows.<br> The strong and fierce he does not dread;<br> And on the poor or widowed head<br>   Insult he never throws. <a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="green">p. 414</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Again the people often say:—<br>   "Virtue is very light?<br> Light as a hair; yet few can bear<br>   The burden of its weight."<br> ’Tis so; but Chung Shan, as I think,<br> Needs not from virtue's weight to shrink,<br>   That other men defies.<br> Aid from my love his strength rejects.<br> If the king's measures have defects,<br>   What's needed he supplies.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>He asks the spirit of the path<br>   His blessing to send down.<br> His steeds are strong; each soldier hath<br>   A bravery like his own.<br> Eastward they march; his charge is there.<br> That city's bulwarks to repair,<br>   How ardently he hies!<br> List to the tinkling of his bells!<br> Of his steeds' constant tramp it tells;—<br>   The walls will soon arise. <a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="green">p. 415</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Yes, on to Ch‘i the hero went,<br>   With his four steeds so strong.<br> Their eight bells told his purpose bold;—<br>   He'll not be absent long!<br> I, Yin Chi-fu, this song now sing.<br> Like gentle breeze, O may it bring<br>   To his unresting mind,<br> ’Mid all his toils and cares, some cheer!<br> Yes, may our great Chung Shan find here<br>   The comfort I designed!</p></div>
