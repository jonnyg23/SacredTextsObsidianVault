 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chang Wu;</i> narrative. Celebrating an expedition of king Hsüan against the more northern tribes of the Huai,—its imposing progress and complete success.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Nan Chung's descendant, Huang the Great,<br>   Grand master, now draws near<br> Before the king, and to him straight<br>   The king's charge, loud and clear, <a name="page_424"><font size="1" color="green">p. 424</font></a><br> Comes thus:—"My armies six forth call;<br>   What war requires make ready all;—<br> South we our course direct.<br>   Your duties reverently fulfill,<br> And wary be lest our good will<br>   Those southern states reject."  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Next to the chief of Yin ’twas said:—<br>   "Charge Hsiu-fu, earl of Ch‘êng,<br> The ranks to range, and warning dread<br>   Make through the host to ring.<br> Our march along the Huai's bank lies;<br>   Against Hsü must our enterprise<br> Rapid and sure be made.<br>   Delay we brook not, nor to hold<br> The land we take, lest the threefold<br>   Work in the fields be stayed."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The son of Heaven calm, trustful was,<br>   Majestic in his strength.<br> His troops advanced, no crowded mass,<br>   Nor lines of broken length. <a name="page_425"><font size="1" color="green">p. 425</font></a><br> From stage to stage, as on they went,<br>   The land of Hsü with terror rent,<br> Its people all unmanned.<br>   As when men hear the thunder's roll,<br> Or sudden crash, and quake in soul,<br>   So now shook all the land.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The king aroused his martial might,<br>   As he were moved with rage.<br> His tiger chiefs he sent to fight;<br>   And eager to engage<br> Well named were they! Along Huai's banks<br>   Soon grandly moved the royal ranks.<br> A captive crowd was held.<br>   Securely kept the country round,<br> No rebel hosts a passage found,<br>   Succor to Hsü to yield.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Numerous the legions, moving fleet,<br>   As if on wings they flew;<br> Grand as the Chiang and Han, when meet<br>   Their mingled streams the view. <a name="page_426"><font size="1" color="green">p. 426</font></a><br> Solid as mountain mass they seemed,<br>   And brightly as the river gleamed,<br> Whose waters ceaseless rush.<br>   Continuous, in order sure,<br> Inscrutable, success secure,<br>   They marched revolt to crush.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>The king's plans truthful and sincere,<br>   Hsü's tribes at once sought peace.<br> Its chiefs assembled all; their prayer<br>   Was for the royal grace.<br> And quickly by the son of Heaven<br>   Was order to the country given;<br> In solemn court he shone.<br>   Before him came the chiefs, and swore<br> That they would break their faith no more.<br>   "The war," he said, "is done."</p></div>
