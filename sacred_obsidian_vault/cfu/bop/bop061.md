 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Mêng;</i> narrative, with the other elements interspersed. A woman, who had formed an improper connection, now cast off, relates and bemoans her sad case.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>A simple-looking lad you seemed,<br>   When first you met my eye,<br> By most a traveling merchant deemed,<br>   Raw silk for cloth to buy.<br> But your true aim was to propose<br>   That I should go with you;<br> And through the Ch‘i I went quite free,<br>   Until we reached Tun-ch‘iu.<br> ’Twas then I said, "It is not I,<br>   Who would the time delay;<br> Your go-between I have not seen,<br>   I must not run away.<br> I pray, sir, do not angry be;<br>   In autumn be the day."  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>When autumn came, then climbed I oft<br>   That ruined wall, and gazed<br> Towards Fu-kuan, my heart all soft,<br>   With expectation raised. <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a><br> When you came not, my hapless lot<br>   With streams of tears I mourned.<br> At last your longed-for form I saw,<br>   And tears to smiles were turned.<br> With words I strove to tell my love,<br>   While you averment made<br> That shell and seeds good answer gave<br>   "No more delay," I said.<br> "Your carriage bring; I'll go at once,<br>   My goods all in it laid."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>When on the mulberry tree the leaves<br>   All hang in glossy state,<br> The sight is fair. O dove, beware;<br>   Its fruits intoxicate.<br> Ah! thou, young maiden, too wilt find<br>   Cause for repentance deep,<br> If, by a lover's arts seduced,<br>   Thyself thou fail to keep.<br> A gentleman who hastes to prove<br>   The joys of lawless love,<br> For what is done may still atone;<br>   To thee they'll fatal prove.<br> Thou’lt try in vain excuse to feign,<br>   Lost like the foolish dove. <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>When sheds its leaves the mulberry tree,<br>   All yellow on the ground,<br> And sear they lie. Such fate have I<br>   Through my rash conduct found.<br> Three years with you in poverty<br>   And struggles hard I've passed;<br> And now with carriage curtains wet,<br>   Through flooded Ch‘i. I haste.<br> I always was the same, but you<br>   A double mind have shown.<br> ’Tis you, sir, base, the right transgress;<br>   Your conduct I have known.<br> Aye changing with your moods of mind,<br>   And reckless of my moan.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Three years of life I was your wife,<br>   And labored in your house;<br> I early rose, late sought repose,<br>   And so fulfilled my vows.<br> I never did, one morning's space,<br>   My willing work suspend, <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a><br> But me thus cruelly you treat,<br>   And from your dwelling send.<br> All this my brothers will not own,<br>   At me they'll only jeer,<br> And say I reap as I have sown;<br>   Reply they will not hear.<br> In heart I groan, and sad bemoan<br>   My fate with many a tear.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Together were we to grow old;—<br>   Old now, you make me pine.<br> The Ch‘i aye flows within its banks,<br>   Its shores the lake confine.<br> But you know neither bank nor shore,<br>   Your passions ne’er denied.<br> Back to my happy girlhood's time,<br>   With hair in knot still tied,<br> I wildly go; I'll never know<br>   Its smiles and chat again.<br> To me you clearly swore the faith,<br>   Which now to break you're fain.<br> Could I foresee so false you'd be?<br>   And now regret is vain.</p></div>
