 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Once the road was clear to Chou,<br> O’er it the rank grass grows now.<br> On my heart is sorrow's blight;<br> Ache my limbs as after fight.<br> Through the night, still dressed, I sigh;<br> Ere its time, old age comes nigh.<br> Homeless thus, I find no rest,<br> Head and heart alike distressed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Men with reverence always view<br> Trees that round their homesteads grew.<br> On their fathers all depend,<br> In their mothers have a friend.<br> From my father's loins I sprung,<br> On my mother's breast I hung;<br> Yet did Heaven my being give,<br> ’Neath a baleful star to live. <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></a></p>

I try in vain<br> Briefest rest from thought to gain.</p>
