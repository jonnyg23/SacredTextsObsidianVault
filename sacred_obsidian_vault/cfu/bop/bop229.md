 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The drums loud sound, the organ swells;<br>       Their flutes the dancers wave.<br> The other instruments and bells<br>       Join in the concert grave.<br> Thus with our music blends the dance,<br> The solemn service to enhance,<br>       Which to our sires is paid.<br> When rites, the greatest and the least,<br> Have been performed to grace the feast,<br>       Then to our king ‘tis said,<br> "Blessings on you your sires bestow."<br> With joy his sons and grandsons glow;<br> They feel inspired to show their care,<br> And reverently themselves to bear.<br> The guests then come, in order led,<br> By him who is their chief and head.<br> With those who represent the dead<br>       They drink in reverent style.<br> Attendants wait their cups to fill,<br> But order rules ’midst their good will.<br> Our cups are only drunk to cheer;<br> Our temple services are clear<br>       From all excesses vile. <a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>When to the mats the guests approach,<br>       Mild harmony holds rule.<br> These dare not upon those encroach,<br>       And no one plays the fool.<br> So long as in duo bounds they keep,<br>       Discreetly they behave;<br> But when those bounds they overleap,<br>       Then where are they,—so grave?<br> They leave the mats, and prance about;<br>       They caper round and round.<br> Their caution all is put to rout;<br>       Their wits fall to the ground.<br> Anon as still more drunk they grow,<br>       On rudeness they are set.<br> The cups their reason overthrow,<br>       And they themselves forget.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Yes, when the guests have drunk too much,<br>       They shout aloud and brawl.<br> The dishes get no gentle touch;<br>       Disorder fills the hall. <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></a><br> They dance about, now fast, now slow,<br>       Can hardly keep their feet.<br> What fools they are they do not know;<br>       No one resumes his seat.<br> Each cap, awry, will hardly stay<br>       Upon the giddy head;<br> But they keep on in madness’ way,<br>       And no exposure dread.<br> If, when their wits began to reel,<br>       They left the room at once,<br> Both host and guests would happier feel,<br>       Nor know the sad mischance.<br> But holding on, themselves they harm.<br>       The drinking feast is good<br> Only when guests their wills can arm<br>       Against misconduct rude.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Whene’er a drinking feast is set,<br> Some sober keep, some drunk will get.<br> One is appointed to preside,<br> With an assistant by his side,<br> Record to make, as they decide,<br>       Who praise deserve, who blame. <a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></a><br> But sots there are, in vice quite sunk,<br> Who, seeing some will not get drunk,<br>       Say, "We for you feel shame."<br> These, if they could get in a word,<br> Might counsel to the rest afford.<br> To fright them from their wild excess,<br> Sternly they might them thus address:—<br> "From such improper speech refrain;<br> Not called to speak, your tongues restrain.<br> You're drunk; if but a word you say,<br> We'll send you out this very day,<br> To find a thing which nature scorns,—<br> A ram full grown, yet wanting horns.<br> Drink but three cups, your memory's gone;<br> How can you drinking still go on?"</p></div>
