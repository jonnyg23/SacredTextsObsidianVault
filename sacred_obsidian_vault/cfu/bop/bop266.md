 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Sang Jou;</i> metaphorical, narrative, and allusive. The earl of Jui mourns over the disorder and misery of the times, with a view to reprehend the misgovernment of King Li,—especially his oppressions and listening to bad counselors.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>See the luxuriant mulberry tree,<br>   That threw far round its leafy shade,<br> Now by rude hands—sad sight to see!<br>   Stript of its leaves, a ruin made.<br> So on our multitudes descends<br>   Oppression's fierce and ruthless hand.<br> My heart beneath its sorrow bends.<br>   Great Heaven, take pity on the land!  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Eager and strong, the war steeds prance;<br>   Falcon and other banners fly.<br> Bristles the land with spear and lance;<br>   Wasted and peeled our regions lie.<br> Disorder grows, and peace is fled; .<br>   Where is the black-haired race of yore?<br> Beneath the sky with ruin red<br>   Chou's kingdom sinks to rise no more. <a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="green">p. 397</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Who can arrest the march of fate?<br>   Heaven nurtures not, but glows with ire.<br> No town presents a sheltering gate;<br>   Where can our hurrying feet retire?<br> When good men, sons of peace, bear sway,<br>   They smooth and knit the social state.<br> They are not here;—who paved the way<br>   For those through whom come strife and hate?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Sore anguish dwells within my heart;<br>   I brood upon the country's woes.<br> Why was I born to have my part<br>   Now when great Heaven its anger shows?<br> Throughout our coasts, from east to west,<br>   No quiet resting place is found.<br> I wander, desolate, distressed,<br>   And troubles rave our borders round.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>You plan, O king, and caution use?<br>   Lo! growing ills, dismembered land! <a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="green">p. 398</font></a><br> Your great concern should be to choose<br>   The best, around your throne to stand.<br> Be this your way! What burns and glows,<br>   Ere used, you in the water cool.<br> How can your methods bring repose?<br>   Ruin awaits you, and your rule.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>One struggles on against the wind,<br>   With breathless effort,—all in vain.<br> So they who fain would serve thee find<br>   A baffling force, and little gain.<br> They till the fields who might have shone<br>   High in official rank and power;<br> For now, ambition's impulse gone,<br>   They sow and reap, and seek no more.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Heaven thus inflicts death and unrest;<br>   And lo! we see a kingless throne!<br> And still there comes the insect pest,<br>   And farmers’ hopes are overthrown. <a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="green">p. 399</font></a><br> Woe! woe to our great central land!<br>   For all in peril heaves my sigh.<br> Bereft of strength, I sadly stand,<br>   And silent view the vault on high.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>See here a ruler, firm and good,<br>   Whom chiefs and people all revere!<br> He keeps his heart; his plans are shrewd;<br>   He seeks for helpers far and near.<br> See there one of a different kind,<br>   Who thinks none but himself is wise!<br> Within his narrow range confined,<br>   His actions only cause surprise.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_9">9</a></font></span>Lo! ’mongst the trees, the herds of deer<br>   In concord roam throughout the wood.<br> With us all friends are insincere;<br>   None cultivate the faithful mood.<br> "Advance! Retreat!" thus people say;<br> "There's equal danger either way." <a name="page_400"><font size="1" color="green">p. 400</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span>Here is a sage! His views and speech<br>   Go far beyond the present time.<br> There is a fool! With narrow reach,<br>   His smallest thoughts he counts sublime.<br> All this before I could have told.<br>   Oh! why did fear my tongue withhold?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_11">11</a></font></span>The good man see! His way is barred;<br>   He pines unused, or dwells unsought.<br> See now the man whose heart is hard!<br>   He's courted, and to honor brought.<br> Such government disorder breeds;<br>   The people haste to evil deeds.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_12">12</a></font></span>From the large valleys come the winds;<br>   There they collect, and thence they blow.<br> And thus the virtuous man one finds<br>   Doing what's good;—he must act so.<br> But he, whose nature scorns the right,<br>   His nature vile, ’gainst good will fight.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_13">13</a></font></span>By force of nature blows the wind;<br>   So men of greed will strive for pelf.<br> Would he but hear, I'd speak my mind;—<br>   As drunk, I mutter to myself. <a name="page_401"><font size="1" color="green">p. 401</font></a><br> He will not use the good; and I<br>   Deplore his course with moan and sigh.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_14">14</a></font></span>Ah! friends, these lines, I know full well,<br>   Will only wake your angry thought;<br> But random shot may sometimes tell,<br>   And bird on wing be hit and caught.<br> Your good, and that alone, I seek,<br>   Howe’er your anger you may wreak.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_15">15</a></font></span>Those hypocrites, adepts in lies,<br>   Produce the chaos of the land.<br> The more one's weak, the more he plies<br>   Whatever strength he can command.<br> The people hopelessly perverse!<br>   ’Tis their vile work has wrought this curse.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_16">16</a></font></span>The people show unrest, because<br>   Those artful villains on them prey.<br> They listen to you with applause;<br>   Behind your back what's bad they say.<br> Ah! friends, these charges you deny.<br>   My song is true! It does not lie.</p></div>
