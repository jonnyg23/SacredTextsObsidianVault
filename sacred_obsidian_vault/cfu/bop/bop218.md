They will reward<br> With myriad years his duty shown,<br> And sure maintain upon the throne<br>       His sons till time shall end. <a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></a></p>

Both your spirits rare<br> And viands rich your sires enjoy.<br> Blessings not few, without alloy,<br> They give;—each all that you could hope,<br> Each sure as law's unerring scope,<br> Exact in form, without delay,<br> Due reverence you have striven to pay.<br> From error free, discharged with care,<br> Your ceremonies all declare<br> Your filial heart. Your sires henceforth<br> Will favors grant of greatest worth,<br> For myriad years, and myriads more,<br> Nor time exhaust the boundless store."<br>       ’Tis this the wise priest says. <a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="green">p. 285</font></a></p>
