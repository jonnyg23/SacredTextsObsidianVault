For dullness where you find,<br> ’Tis from defect within the mind;<br> And if a wise man dull appear,<br> He wrongs his native character.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>What's mightiest is—the man to be.<br> This powerful everywhere we see.<br> Where from true virtue actions spring,<br> All their obedient homage bring.<br> Whose views are great, and fixed his aims;<br> Who in due time his will proclaims;<br> Whose plans reach far; whose reverent care<br> His outward bearing shall declare:—<br> Him a true chief the people call,<br> And hailed his pattern is by all.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Look at the present state of things!<br> Your conduct only chaos brings.<br> Low in the dust your virtue lies,<br> A drunken sot whom men despise<br> You seize the joy before you brought,<br> And give not to the past a thought. <a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="green">p. 391</font></a><br> Oh! bear in mind the kings of old,<br> And strive their statutes fast to hold.</p>

As flow<br> The waters from their spring, they go<br> To ruin all.—This lesson know.<br> Rise early, and go late to sleep;<br> Sprinkled and swept your courtyard keep;—<br> Thus to your people pattern be.<br> Well to your steeds and chariots see;<br> And bows and shafts, and weapons all,<br> Have ready at a moment's call.<br> So shall you stand prepared for war,<br> And keep the southern hordes afar.</p>

No, no!<br> There's none for you your tongue can guard.<br> O’er it yourself keep watch and ward.<br> Answers to every word will leap;<br> Good deeds their recompense shall reap<br> If friends from you with kindness meet,<br> And subjects as your sons you treat,<br> Your line from age to age shall live,<br> And subjects strict obedience give.</p>

Please here discern<br> Cause and effect together bound,<br> In certain sequence ever found.<br> Seek horns on lamb! It has not horns.<br> Your sense, my son, such seeking scorns.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_10">10</a></font></span>Ere you knew right from wrong, my son,<br> I held your hand, and led you on,<br> Showing what things were good, what bad;—<br> Such lessons from my lips you had.<br> And lest you should not clearly hear,<br> I held you gently by the ear.<br> A son since then your arms has filled;<br> And have you still a mind unskilled?<br> ’Tis self-sufficiency doth hold<br> The early taught still dark when old.</p>
