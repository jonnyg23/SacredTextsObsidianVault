 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chia Lo;</i> narrative. In praise of some king,—perhaps King Ch‘êng,—whose virtue secured to him the favor of Heaven; presaging for him all happiness, and especially a line of distinguished posterity. Probably the response of the personators of the departed to the preceding piece.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>What brilliant virtue does our king,<br>   Whom all admire and love, display!<br> People and officers all sing<br>   The praise of his impartial sway.<br> Heaven to his sires the kingdom gave,<br>   And him with equal favor views.<br> Heaven's strength and aid will ever save<br>   The throne whose grant it oft renews.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>By virtue sought, fresh honors shine;<br>   All other blessings follow sure. <a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="green">p. 370</font></a><br> Admired and reverent, lo! his line<br>   Through myriad ages shall endure.<br> From error free, to duty true,<br>   They rule the states, they fill the throne.<br> Nor shall they fail with homage due<br>   The olden statutes aye to own.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>A bearing high and self-restrained<br>   May they in all their conduct show!<br> And thus their virtuous fame unstained<br>   With lapse of time still brighter grow!<br> From jealousies and envies free,<br>   May they advance the good to place!<br> And blessings, boundless in degree,<br>   Their rule through all our regions grace!</p>  
 <p>4 When so those sons of Heaven shall sway,<br>   Nor greater cares their care withdraw<br> From smallest things, friends shall obey,<br>   And find repose beneath their law.<br>   Love shall around them cast its chain,<br> Kings who not idly fill their seat.<br>   The people restful peace shall gain,<br> And each king with their praises greet.</p></div>
