 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Lieh Tsu;</i> narrative. Appropriate, probably, like the last piece, to a sacrifice to Tang,—dwelling on the spirits, the soups, and the gravity of the service, and on the assisting princes.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">Ah! from our sire, whose merit vast we own,<br> What blessings ever upon us come down,<br> Abiding, oft-repeated, deeds of grace!<br> And you, O king, receive them in this place. <a name="page_480"><font size="1" color="green">p. 480</font></a><br> Here in our vessels shine the spirits clear,<br> And Tang himself, much wished for, shall appear.<br> Here too are set the soups of flavor rare,<br> Tempered, and mixed, with cunning and with care.<br> These offerings we set forth, without a word,<br> Without contention, and with one accord,<br> To beg the presence of the honored lord.<br> He will the eyebrows of long life confer,<br> And face of wrinkled age, and whitening hair.  
 <p>With yokes adorned, and naves with leather bound,<br> While at the bits the eight bells tinkling sound,<br> The feudal princes come, to take their part<br> In all the offerings made with rev'rent heart.<br> To us the mighty sovereignty was given;<br> And prosperous fortune long sent down from Heaven<br> Our fruitful harvests clearly prove. And now<br> Himself pleased with our service Tang will show,<br> And on us blessings without end bestow.<br> May Tang regard the rites his son thus pays,<br> As round the summer comes, and autumn days!</p></div>
