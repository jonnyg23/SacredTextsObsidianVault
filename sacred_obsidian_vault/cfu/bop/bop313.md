 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ch‘ang Fa;</i> narrative. Celebrating Ch‘i, the ancestor of the house of Shang; Hsiang-tu, his grandson; T‘ang, the founder of the dynasty; and I Yin, T‘ang's chief adviser.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>  The lords of Shang wisdom profound had shown,<br>   And omens of their greatness long were known.<br>   When the great flood its waters spread around,<br>   And Yü alone to curb its power was found,— <a name="page_483"><font size="1" color="green">p. 483</font></a><br>   Yü who the regions of the land defined,<br>   And to the great fiefs boundaries assigned,<br>   Till o’er the realm was plainly marked each state,—<br>   Even then the house of. Sung ’gan to be great.<br>   God viewed its daughter's son with favoring grace;—<br> He founded Shang; to him its kings their lineage trace.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>  He, the dark king, ruled with a powerful sway,<br>   Success attendant on his glorious way.<br>   First with a small state charged, then with a large,<br>   He failed not well his duties to discharge.<br>   His rules of conduct he himself obeyed,<br>   And prompt response all to his lessons made.<br>   Next came Hsiang-tu, the prince of ardent soul,<br>   And from Hsia's center, to the four seas’ goal,<br> Submissively all owned and bowed to his control.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>  God in His favor Shang's house would not leave,<br>   And then T‘ang rose that favor to receive.<br>   T‘ang's birth was not from Ch‘i too far removed.<br>   His sagely reverence daily greater proved.<br>   For long to Heaven his brilliant influence rose,<br>   And while his acts the fear of God disclose,<br> T‘ang as fit model God for the nine regions chose. <a name="page_484"><font size="1" color="green">p. 484</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>  To him gave up the princes, great and small,<br>   The ensigns of their rank; on hint they all,<br>   Like to the pendants of a banner, hung:—<br>   So from indulgent Heaven his greatness sprung!<br>   Tang used no violence, nor was he slow;<br>   Nor hard, nor soft, extremes he did not know.<br>   His royal rules abroad were gently spread;—<br> All dignities and wealth were gathered round his head.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>  To him from all the states their tribute flowed,<br>   And like a strong steed, he sustained the load.<br>   Such was the favor he received from Heaven!<br>   Proof of his valor through the realm was given.<br>   His steadfast soul ’mid terrors never quailed;<br>   Nor wavered he by troublous doubts assailed;—<br> On to the sovereign seat he struggled, and prevailed.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>  The martial king aloft his banner reared,<br>   And in the field against his foes appeared.<br>   He grasped his battle-ax with reverent hand;<br>   ’Gainst the attack his foes could make no stand. <a name="page_485"><font size="1" color="green">p. 485</font></a><br>   His progress was like march of blazing fire;<br>   None could resist the torrent of his ire.<br>   Like root with three shoots was the chiefest fore;—<br>   Advance none made he, and no growth could show.<br>   Of the nine regions Tang possession got;<br>   First with the lords of Wei and Ku he fought,<br> And then K‘un-wu’s strong chief, and Chieh of Hsia he smote.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>  In the mid time, between Hsiang-tu and T‘ang,<br>   A shaking came, and peril threatened Shang.<br>   But Heaven approved T‘ang as its chosen son,<br>   And gave for minister the great I Yin,—<br> A-hêng, who for the king a prosperous issue won.</p></div>
