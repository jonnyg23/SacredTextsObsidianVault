 <p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">IV</h4>  
 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chio Kung;</i> allusive, narrative, and metaphorical. Against the king's cold treatment of his relatives by consanguinity and affinity; the extensive and baneful influence of his example; the encouragement given by him to calumniators.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Whene’er we strongly bend a bow,<br>   Both string and ends we near us bring;<br> And when we let the tension go,<br>   From us with quick recoil they spring.<br> So when we show affection deep,<br>   Our kith and kin to us we draw;<br> But when from them aloof we keep,<br>   They shrink from us by nature's law.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>When you, O king, to kin are cold,<br>   Such coldness rules throughout the land.<br> You for their teacher all men hold;<br>   To learn your ways needs no command.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Brethren whose virtue stands the test,<br>   By bad example still unchanged,<br> Their generous feelings manifest,<br>   Nor grow among themselves estranged.<br> But if their virtue weakly fails<br>   The evil influence to withstand,<br> Then selfishness o’er love prevails,<br>   And troubles rise on every hand. <a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>When men in disputations fine<br>   To hear their consciences refuse,<br> Then ’gainst each other they repine,<br>   And each maintains his special views.<br> If one a place of rank obtain,<br>   And scorn humility to show,<br> The others view him with disdain,<br>   And, wrangling, all to ruin go.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>A colt the old horse deems himself,<br>   And vainly hastens to the race;<br> So thinks the mean man, bent on pelf,<br>   Himself fit for the highest place:<br> Stuffed to the full, he still shall feed,<br>   Nor own that he has had enough.<br> He drinks, and with insatiate greed,<br>   Knows not the time for leaving off.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>The monkeys by their nature know<br>   The way to climb a tree, untaught.<br> We need no mud on him to throw,<br>   Whom lying in the mud we've caught.<br> The nature of all meaner men<br>   Leads them to follow and obey.<br> Nor right, nor wrong the millions ken,<br>   But imitate the sovereign's way.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>The snow falls fast, and all the ground<br>   Hides with its masses, white and clear;<br> But when the sunbeams play around,<br>   It soon will melt and disappear. <a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></a><br> This fact, O king, you don't perceive;<br>   Those men who calumnies diffuse,<br> Not heeding, to themselves you leave,<br>   And your indulgence they abuse.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Yes, though the snow lie drifted deep,<br>   Away before the heat ’twill flow.<br> I for the king's neglect must weep;—<br>   Like Man or Mao those men will grow.</p></div>
