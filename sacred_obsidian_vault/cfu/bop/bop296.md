 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Fang Lo;</i> narrative. Seems to be a sequel to the preceding piece. The young king tells of his difficulties and incompetences; asks for counsel to help to copy the example of his father; states how he meant to do so; and concludes with an appeal or prayer to his father.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">At, the beginning of my sway,<br>   Counsel I seek to know<br> How in my shrinèd father's way<br>   My feet may surely go.  
 <p>Far-reaching were, his life proclaims,<br>   The plans of his great mind;<br> But how to carry out his aims<br>   I fail as yet to find. <a name="page_452"><font size="1" color="green">p. 452</font></a></p>  
 <p>When most my powers I shall have tried<br>   To reach to his grand height,<br> My steps will ever turn aside,<br>   Or to the left or right.</p>  
 <p>I'm but a child, how can I hope<br>   Aright my seat to fill,<br> Or with the many troubles cope<br>   That bode disturbance still?</p>  
 <p>O excellent and mighty sire,<br>   To help thy son now deign!<br> With thy high wisdom me inspire,<br>   And on thy throne maintain.</p>  
 <p>To thee, as ever near, I'll try<br>   My virtue true to prove.<br> In court, in house, before my eye,<br>   Thy form shall always move.</p></div>
