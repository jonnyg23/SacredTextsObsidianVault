 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The plants will ear; within their sheath confined,<br> The grains will harden, and be good in kind,<br> Nor darnel these, nor wolf's-tail grass infests;<br> From core and leaf we pick the insect pests,<br> And pick we those that eat the joints and roots:—<br> So do we guard from harm the growing fruits.<br> May the great spirit, whom each farmer names,<br> Those insects take, and cast them to the flames! <a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="green">p. 292</font></a></p>
