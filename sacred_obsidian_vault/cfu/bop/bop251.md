 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The king was walking in his wondrous park,<br>   Where lay the does, all sleek and clean.<br> ’Twas sweet to him their restfulness to mark,<br>   And see the white birds’ glistening sheen.<br> Then to his wondrous pond he took his way,<br> To view the fish their bounding life display.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Right in the middle of a circling pool,<br>   His hall, the place of joy, he reared.<br> For music there he made provision full.<br>   ’Twixt pillars finely carved appeared<br> Face boards, with tops of finest tracery,<br> ’Neath which large drums and bells were hanging free. <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="green">p. 353</font></a></p>
