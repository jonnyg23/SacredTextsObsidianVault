 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Han Yi</i>; narrative. Celebrating the marquis of Han:—his investitute and the king's charge to him; the gifts he received, and the parting feast; his marriage; the excellence of his territory; and his sway over the regions of the north.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Grand is the guardian hill of Han!<br> There the Great Yü his work began,<br>   The land from wreck to save.<br> Thence to the capital there leads<br> A noble road. See there the steeds<br> That draw Han's lord, as he proceeds<br>   Investitute to crave. <a name="page_416"><font size="1" color="green">p. 416</font></a><br> Called now his father's seat to fill,<br> He goes to hear the royal will.<br>   To him the king thus said:<br> "As served your fathers, so serve you.<br> Be careful my commands to do.<br> Early and late show active zeal;<br> With reverence seek the kingdom's weal.<br>   And thus your fealty paid<br> Shall strengthen the great fief I give;—<br> Marquis of Han you long shall live.<br> What princes come not to my court<br> Deal with, until they here resort,<br>   And thus your sovereign aid."  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Oh! noble was the marquis’ team.<br> Both long and large, the steeds beseem<br>   His youthful state and port.<br> His mace of rank he with him brought,<br> When audience of the king he sought,<br>   And bowed within his court.<br> The king his royal favor showed.<br> And on him princely gifts bestowed. <a name="page_417"><font size="1" color="green">p. 417</font></a><br> Those were—the dragon flag, whence streamed<br> Its pennon that with plumelets gleamed;<br> The brilliant yoke; the bamboo screen;<br> The robe with dragon on it seen;<br> Red slippers; and the hooks to shine<br> On his steeds’ breasts; the frontlets fine,<br> Whose carvings should their foreheads grace;<br> The board across his car to place;<br> The tiger's skin, to throw around<br> That leaning board with leather bound.<br> Then last there came the rein ends bright,<br> Tipt with gilt rings,—a splendid sight.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The court now leaving, home he hies;<br> But first he offers sacrifice,<br> And prays the spirit of the way<br> Guidance to give. That night to stay<br> At Too he planned. The parting feast<br> Hsien-fu there gives to speed the guest.<br> The court sends forth its many lords,<br> To taste the cheer the king affords.<br> An hundred vases stand around,<br> All with the choicest spirits crowned.<br> The mats roast turtle and fresh fish<br> Present, and many a lordly dish. <a name="page_418"><font size="1" color="green">p. 418</font></a><br> And bamboo sprouts, and tender shoots,<br> And sauces fine, and fragrant fruits,<br> With their rich perfume fill the air.<br> Oh! but it was a banquet rare!<br> It closed, and lo! before the gate,<br> With mighty steeds, a car of state!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Now back in Han, its lord must wed,<br>   And home a wife shall bring.<br> To Chüeh-fu's child his suit he paid,<br>   The niece of Fên, our king.<br> The union fixed, in grand array,<br> To Chüeh-fu's house he takes his way;<br>   An hundred cars attend.<br> The tinkling music falls and swells,<br> Emitted by their numerous bells,<br> As on their course they wend.<br> The glory of that day was great.<br> Lo! round the bride in fairest state,<br> The virgins, her companions, stand,<br> Close following her on either hand.<br> As lovely clouds that slowly sail,<br> And the moon's greater glory veil, <a name="page_419"><font size="1" color="green">p. 419</font></a><br>   So beautiful were they.<br> The marquis looked, with rapture thrilled.<br> Never was gate with splendor filled,<br>   As Chüeh-fu's gate that day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Great fame Chüeh-fu bas got in war,<br> And every state has seen his car;<br> But through the land, where’er he went,<br> To settle his dear child intent,<br>   No state like Han he saw.<br> Oh! pleasant is the state of Han!<br> Chüeh saw the mighty streams that ran<br> Through all its length, and then the lakes,<br> With forests girt and tangled brakes,<br>   That admiration draw.<br> Big bream and tench the waters fill,<br> And in the glades on every hill<br>   Are multitudes of deer.<br> In wilder parts the grisly bear,<br> Tigers and wild eats, make their lair.<br>   Hunters their prey find here.<br> Chüeh saw, and pleasure filled his breast,<br> And here his child found joy and rest. <a name="page_420"><font size="1" color="green">p. 420</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>The multitudes of Yen had reared<br>   Han's walls, and made them strong.<br> Its rulers then no foeman feared;<br> There had they dwelt for long.<br> The first of them a charge had got,<br> From Han, as from a central spot,<br>   To rule the tribes around.<br> The marquis now got wider charge,<br> His jurisdiction to enlarge<br>   O’er all the northern ground.<br> The Chuy and Mih to curb and awe,<br> And bring to own Chou's sovereign law,<br>   Would his first care require.<br> Then stronger walls and deeper moat<br> Would silence each rebellious note,<br>   And all with fear inspire.<br> The fields too he must now define,<br> And the fixed revenue assign,<br>   As in the king's domain.<br> His bearers shall to court repair,<br> With skins stript from the tawny bear,<br> The white fox and the panther red,<br> In yearly course a tribute paid,<br>   The king's trust to maintain.</p></div>
