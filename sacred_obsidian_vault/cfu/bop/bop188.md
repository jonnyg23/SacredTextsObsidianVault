 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ch‘ê Kung;</i> narrative. Celebrating a great hunting, presided over by King Hsüan, on occasion of his giving audience to the feudal princes at the eastern capital of Lu.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Our chariots were well built and firm,<br>   Well matched our steeds, and fleet and strong.<br> Four, sleek and large, each chariot drew,<br>   And eastward thus we drove along.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Our hunting cars were light and good,<br>   Each with its team of noble steeds.<br> Still further east we took the way<br>   To Fu mere's grassy plains that leads.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Loud-voiced, the masters of the chase<br>   Arranged the huntsmen, high and low. <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></a><br> While banners streamed, and oxtails flew,<br>   We sought the prey on distant Gaou.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Each with full team, the princes came,<br>   A lengthened train in bright array.<br> In gold-wrought slippers, kneecaps red,<br>   They looked as on an audience day.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Each right thumb wore the metal guard;<br>   On the left arm its shield was bound.<br> In unison the arrows flew;<br>   The game lay piled upon the ground.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>The leaders of the tawny teams<br>   Sped on their course, direct and true.<br> The drivers perfect skill displayed;<br>   Like blow well aimed each arrow flew.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Neighing and pleased, the steeds returned;<br>   The bannered lines back slowly came.<br> No jostling rude disgraced the crowd;<br>   The king declined large share of game.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>So did this famous hunt proceed!<br>   So free it was from clamorous sound!<br> Well does our king become his place,<br>   And high the deeds his reign have crowned!</p></div>
