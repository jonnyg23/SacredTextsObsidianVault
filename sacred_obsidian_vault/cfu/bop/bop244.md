 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Wên Wang;</i> narrative. Celebrating King Wên, dead and alive, as the founder of the dynasty of Chou, showing how his virtues drew to him the favoring regard of Heaven, and made him a bright pattern to his descendants and their ministers.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>The royal Wên now rests on high,<br> Enshrined in brightness of the sky.<br> Chou as a state had long been known,<br> And Heaven's decree at last was shown.<br> Its lords had borne a glorious name;<br> God kinged them when the season came.<br> King Wên ruled well when earth he trod;<br> Now moves his spirit near to God.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>A strong-willed, earnest king was Wên,<br> And still his fame rolls widening on. <a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></a><br> The gifts that God bestowed on Chou<br> Belong to Wên's descendants now.<br> Heaven blesses still with gifts divine<br> The hundred scions of his line;<br> And all the officers of Chou<br> From age to age more lustrous grow.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>More lustrous still-from age to age,<br> All reverent plans their zeal engage;<br> And brilliant statesmen owe their birth<br> To this much.-favored spot of earth.<br> They spring like products of the land,—<br> The men by whom the realm doth stand.<br> Such aid their numerous bands supply,<br> That Wan, rests tranquilly on high.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Deep were Wên's thoughts, sustained his ways;<br> His reverence lit its trembling rays.<br> Resistless came great Heaven's decree;<br> The sons of Shang must bend the knee;— <a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="green">p. 333</font></a><br> The sons of Shang, each one a king,<br> In numbers beyond numbering.<br> Yet as God spoke, so must it be:—<br> The sons of Shang all bent the knee.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Now each to Chou his homage pays,—<br> So dark and changing are Heaven's ways.<br> When we pour our libations here,<br> The officers of Shang appear,<br> Quick and alert to give their aid;—<br> Such is the service by them paid,<br> While still, they do not cast aside<br> The cap and broidered ax,—their pride.<br> Ye servants of our line of kings,<br> Remember him from whom it springs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Remember him from whom it springs;—<br> Let this give to your virtue wings.<br> Seek harmony with Heaven's great mind;—<br> So shall you surest blessing find.<br> Ere Shang had lost the nation's heart,<br> Its monarchs all with God had part<br> In sacrifice. From them you see<br> ’Tis hard to keep high Heaven's decree. <a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>’Tis hard to keep high Heaven's decree!<br> O sin not, or you cease to be.<br> To add true luster to your name,<br> See Shang expire in Heaven's dread flame.<br> For Heaven's high dealings are profound,<br> And far transcend all sense and sound.<br> From Wên your pattern you must draw,<br> And all the states will own your law.</p></div>
