 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Tsai Chien;</i> narrative. Appropriate to an occasion when the feudal princes were assisting King Ch‘êng at a sacrifice to King Wu.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">Before their sovereign king the lords appeared,<br>   To seek the rules that he for them ordains. <a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="green">p. 448</font></a><br> Their banners bright with dragon blazonry<br>   Waved grandly in the air. Upon their reins<br> Rings glittering shone, while on their broidered flags<br>   And carriage fronts bells gave a tinkling sound.<br> Thus full of majesty, they came to court,<br>   And splendid were their equipages found!  
 <p>The king then led them on the left, and laid,<br>   With filial heart, before his father's shrine,<br> His offerings, that long life he might obtain,<br>   And still preserve the honors of his line.<br> Favors he gets, both great and manifold.<br>   ’Tis from those brilliant and accomplished lords<br> They spring; and there shall long through them descend<br>   Blessings unmixed and bright that Heaven affords.</p></div>
