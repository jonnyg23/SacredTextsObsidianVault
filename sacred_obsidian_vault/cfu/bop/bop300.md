 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Liang Ssŭ;</i> narrative. Much akin to the preceding:—presumably an ode of thanksgiving in the autumn to the spirits of the land and grain.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">With sharp and well-shaped glittering share,<br> The toilers turn, with patient care,<br> The southern acres to prepare.  
 <p>The different kinds of grain they sow.<br> Each seed, though hid the earth below,<br> Its form of life will quickly show.</p>  
 <p>Behold their wives and children there!<br> These the cooked millet to them bear,<br> Carried in baskets round and square.</p>  
 <p>In light splint hats their hoes they speed,<br> Clearing the ground for fruitful seed,<br> And rooting out the noisome weed.</p>  
 <p>The weeds, uprooted, die away,<br> And feed the ground by their decay.<br> The millets grow from day to day. <a name="page_458"><font size="1" color="green">p. 458</font></a></p>  
 <p>And now the golden stalks and tall<br> Before the reapers, rustling, fall.<br> Straightway they're built up like a wall.</p>  
 <p>High as a wall the sheaves are placed,<br> Like comb teeth close, and interlaced.<br> Anon the grain is stored in haste.</p>  
 <p>Hundreds of houses hold the store;<br> The wives and children fret no more;<br> The labors of the year are o’er.</p>  
 <p>This black-lipped tawny bull we slay,<br> Whose horns the well-known curve display,<br> The rites of husbandry to pay.</p>  
 <p>Thus to the future hand we down<br> These rites long held in high renown,<br> Glad the ancestral ways to own.</p></div>
