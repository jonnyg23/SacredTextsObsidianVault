 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Kung Liu;</i> narrative. The story of Duke Liu:—how he made his first settlement in Pin, building there, laying out the ground, forming armies, arranging for a revenue, till even Pin became too small for all his people.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Duke Liu we sing, with generous ardor fired,<br> Whose breast his people's good alone inspired,<br> In their old seat no longer could he rest;<br> Its narrow limits forced him from the west.<br> The produce of the many fields he reaps;<br> What can be spared, in store he safely keeps.<br> Here in the barn, there in the field, it lies;<br> His forethought then wrapper and sack supplies,<br> This hoard of grain and dried meat to contain,<br> When they should move, a glorious fame to gain.<br> Then ready further with his weapons all,<br> Bows, arrows, shields, spears, axes great and small,<br> His people to the march he forth did call.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Duke Liu we sing, with generous ardor fired,<br> Whose breast his people's good alone inspired.<br> O’er all the plain he ranged with eager eye,<br> But could not space for thronging crowds descry. <a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="green">p. 372</font></a><br> In pity for the numbers thus confined,<br> He told to all the measure in his mind.<br> Loth to abandon their much-loved repose,<br> At first, but not for long, their murmurs rose.<br> Each lofty hilltop now the duke ascends;<br> Back to the plains he comes, and eastward bends<br> His course. Lo! at his girdle pendant seen,<br> The jade, and gems of yao, emit their sheen!<br> Sheathed in its glittering scabbard hangs the sword,<br> That safety from the foeman shall afford.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Duke Liu we sing, with generous ardor fired,<br> Whose breast his people's good alone inspired.<br> To Pin now come, where gush the hundred springs,<br> His followers all about him there he brings.<br> Round him there lay the bright and ample plain;<br> He climbs a ridge, a wider view to gain.<br> Behold! a spacious table-land he spies,<br> Where his new settlement may well arise.<br> For multitudes large space could be assigned,<br> And immigrants still room for booths would find. <a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="green">p. 373</font></a><br> Here then he dwelt, and would his plans unfold;<br> Here counsel took, and heard what others told.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Duke Liu we sing, with generous ardor fired,<br> Whose breast his people's good alone inspired.<br> When on the height his rest he thus had found,<br> His officers all stand in state around.<br> The mats are spread, with stools upon them set;<br> Both old and young, they here are joyous met.<br> From herd and pen the victims both are killed;<br> Dried gourds for cups are with the spirits filled.<br> So does the duke his friends and chieftains feast;<br> Him as their lord and ruler hails each guest.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Duke Liu we sing, with generous ardor fired,<br> Whose breast his people's good alone inspired.<br> When now his bounds extended far and wide,<br> He marked the shadows, thereby to decide<br> The east and west, the north and south, all round.<br> He clomb the ridges, and, observing, found<br> What tracts were in the light, what in the shade. <a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="green">p. 374</font></a><br> The springs and streams he carefully surveyed.<br> Three armies of defense were made. Each plain<br> And marsh was measured; and to till the grain<br> An equal system framed: the farmers wrought,<br> And shared the produce, after they had brought<br> The fair proportion for himself he sought.<br> West of the hills the land he also tilled,<br> And grandly Pin with men and wealth was filled,</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Duke Liu we sing, with generous ardor fired,<br> Whose breast his people's good alone inspired.<br> At first rude homes their purpose served in Pin;<br> Erelong the Wei in boats he crossed, to win<br> Whetstones and iron. Dwellings now they rear,<br> And makeshift huts before them disappear.<br> The houses good, their boundaries well defined,<br> The people multiply, and fortune kind<br> Attends their course. The vale of Huang they fill<br> On either side. The Kuo vale then they till.<br> Still grow their numbers; through the Jui they go;<br> Tracts widely spread now Liu's dominion know.</p></div>
