 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ching Chih;</i> narrative. The young king shows his sense of what was required of him to preserve the favor of Heaven, a constant judge; intimates his good purposes; and asks the help of his ministers to be enabled to fulfill them.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">With reverence I will go<br>   Where duty's path is plain.<br> Heaven's will I clearly know;<br>   Its favor to retain <a name="page_453"><font size="1" color="green">p. 453</font></a><br> Is hard. Let me not say<br>   Heaven is remote on high,<br> Nor notices men's way.<br>   There in the starlit sky<br> It round about us moves,<br>   Inspecting all we do,<br> And daily disapproves<br>   What is not just and true.  
 <p>Only a child am I.<br>   Treading in duty's way,<br> With effort vain I try<br>   Due reverence to display.<br> Each day throughout the year,<br>   How slight the progress seems!<br> But to the vision clear<br>   I'll pass from broken gleams.<br> Aid then my feeble youth<br>   To bear the heavy crown.<br> Teach me the right and truth<br>   Through all my life to own.</p></div>
