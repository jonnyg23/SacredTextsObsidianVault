 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>In grace and grandeur shone our prince and king.<br> At sacrifice his ministers all bring<br>   Their cups, each handle half a mace.<br> Solemn and grave, on left and right they stand,<br> And pour libations with a reverent hand;—<br>   Well do such men the service grace!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Upon the king the boats are borne along,<br> As to their oars the rowers bend, and strong<br>   Impel them to their utmost speed.<br> So marched our king in his avenging wrath,<br> His six hosts swiftly following on his path;—<br>   How could his plans fail to succeed?</p>
