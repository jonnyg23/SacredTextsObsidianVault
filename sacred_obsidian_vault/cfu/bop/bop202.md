 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Shih Yüeh Chih Chiao;</i> narrative. Lamentation of an officer over prodigies, celestial and terrestrial, betokening the ruin of Chou. He expounds the true causes of these and the abounding misery; names the chief culprits, and declares his own determination to remain at his post of duty.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>These bodies, erring, what is bad make known;—<br> Good men neglected; order all o’erthrown.<br> The moon eclipsed was what full oft takes place;<br> The sun's eclipse portends a sadder case.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>And flashing levin shows the want of rest.<br> With troubled streams, and tumbling mountain's crest.<br> Large heights subside to vales; deep vales grow hills.<br> Alas! how does the king not stop these ills?</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Among the ministers great Huang presides;<br> In all their duties Fan the people guides;<br> Chia-pai administers; Chung-yün is cook;<br> The king's decrees Tsou enters in his book;<br> Chüeh regulates the stud; the guards Yü's sphere;<br> The wife, in beauty blazing, has no fear. <a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Great Huang, determined his own course pursues,<br> Demands our service, nor inquires our views;<br> Unroofs our homes; our fields makes moor or marsh;<br> And "’Tis the law," he says, "I am not harsh."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Farseeing Huang has built himself a town.<br> Three ministers are there of wealth o’ergrown.<br> No single chief he left to guard our king,<br> While all its streets with hoof and chariot ring.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>I dare not my own services report;<br> But slanderous tongues my blameless life distort.<br> Our ills come not from Heaven, but fawning words<br> And hidden hate, which schemers wield like swords.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Far off my village, great my lack of peace,<br> And elsewhere I might go to seek for ease.<br> Others retire, but I shall not be driven<br> From this my post, though dark the way of Heaven.</p></div>
