 <p>The polished members of his train<br>   Are with him come in state.<br> With reverence and dignity,<br>   For his commands they wait.</p>

 <p>Bring forth the ropes to bind his steeds.<br>   Alas! he will not bide.<br> To him be every comfort given!<br>   A parting feast provide!</p>  
 <p>The greatest dignity is his.<br>   ’Tis right our noble guest<br> Should with their choicest favors be<br>   By men and spirits graced!</p></div>
