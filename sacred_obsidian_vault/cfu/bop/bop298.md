 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Hsiao Pi;</i> narrative. King Chêng acknowledges that he had erred, and states his purpose to be careful in the future; he will guard against the slight beginnings of evil, and is penetrated with a sense of his own incompetences.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">When of the past I think, myself I blame;<br> I'll guard in future ’gainst what caused me shame<br> I'll shun the wasp, nor do the foolish thing<br> By which I seemed to invite its painful sting.<br> It looked a wren, that I could hold unharmed;<br> It grew to a fierce bird, with talons armed!<br> Uneasy is my head which wears the crown,<br> And bitter trials press me sorely down.</div>
