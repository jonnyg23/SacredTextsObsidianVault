 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ts’ai Shu;</i> allusive and narrative. Responsive to the former;—celebrating the appearance of the feudal princes at the court, the splendor of their array, the propriety of their demeanor, and the favor conferred on them by the king.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>They pull the beans all o’er the ground,<br> To place in baskets square, and round. <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></a><br> So reap they what the fields produce,<br> For present and for future use.<br> When now themselves the princes show<br> No stores have I gifts to bestow,<br>       Befitting their great worth.<br> Yet a state carriage and its team<br> Will well a feudal prince beseem;—<br>       Let such be all brought forth.<br> And from the chambers let them bring<br>       The robes that princes wear.<br> From duke to baron, I, the king,<br>       On them will these confer.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The water bubbles from the spring,<br>       And round it grows the cress.<br> So when the princes see the king,<br>       Their coming they express<br> In various ways. Now here I see<br> Their flags, with dragon blazonry,<br>       All waving in the wind.<br> The gentle tinkling of their bells<br> Comes to my ear, and surely tells<br> They in their chariots, grandly drawn<br> By the four steeds of mighty brawn,<br>       Cannot be far behind. <a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The king soon gets a nearer view.<br>       The covers red he sees<br> Upon their knees, of brilliant hue,<br>       And buskins ’neath the knees.<br> A grave demeanor all display;<br>       The Son of Heaven approves.<br> What to such princes can he say,<br>       Whose presence rapture moves?<br> In admiration and delight,<br>       No grace can he withhold.<br> To some he grants new honors bright,<br>       To some confirms the old.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The oaks their branches wide extend,<br>       With leaves thick covered o’er,<br> Which thus the roots and trunk defend,<br>       And make them thrive the more.<br> So do these princes service do,<br> Throughout the land, while they pursue<br>       The charges to them given.<br> The various regions well they guard, <a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></a><br> Nor think they any labor hard,<br>       To aid the Son of Heaven.<br> All blessings on their heads collect.<br>       And now to court they've brought<br> Their ministers who nought neglect,<br>       Strong both in act and thought.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>The boat is by the rope held fast,<br>       Lest it should float away;<br> So round the princes there is cast<br>       The king's protective stay.<br> He looks on them with joy intense;<br> He scans their merits to dispense<br>       His favors and rewards.<br> He makes their happiness his charge;<br> Their territories to enlarge,<br>       As duty he regards.<br> To them it is a pleasure rare,<br>       A happy, joyous time,<br> When from their states they here repair,<br>       To see his court sublime.</p></div>
