 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>What time in Chou ruled our King Chi,<br> Among the princesses of Chi,<br>     In the domain of Yin,<br> The second daughter of her name<br> Had through the land a noble fame.<br> Her from her parents Chi had sought,<br> And to his capital he brought,<br>     And wedded her, Ta-jên.<br> They both could perfect virtue claim,<br>     No duty left undone.<br> A mother soon the wife became;<br>     The child was our King Wên.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>This our King Wên in all his way<br> Did watchful reverence display,<br> With clearest wisdom serving God,<br> Who, pleased to see the course he trod,<br>     Him with great favor crowned.<br> His virtue no deflection knew,<br> But always to the right was true.<br> The states beheld, and all approved;<br> With loyal ardor stirred and moved,<br>     Wên as their head they owned. <a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="green">p. 336</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Like a fair denizen of Heaven<br> Was she to whom those vows were given.<br> The gifts he sent were deemed complete,<br> And to the Wei, his bride to meet,<br>     Our Wên in person went.<br> A bridge of boats across the stream<br> He Made, as did her state beseem.<br> She crossed; to Chou they held their way.<br> Great was the glory of the day,<br>     And glorious the event!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Heaven thus its grand appointment made,<br> And Wên to all the land displayed, <a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="green">p. 337</font></a><br>     While still he ruled in Fêng.<br> Hsin's eldest daughter was the wife,<br> Whom Heaven prepared to bless his life,<br> And take his virtuous mother's place.<br> And Heaven soon gave them further grace;<br>     ’Twas from them King Wu sprung.<br> Heaven kept and helped the child, until<br>     Its summons to him came.<br> Then Wu marched forth to do its will,<br>     Smote Yin, and won his fame.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Countless as forest leaves, Yin's hosts,<br> Collected from its utmost coasts,<br> Were marshaled in Mu's famous plain,<br> To meet King Wu;—but all in vain.<br>     Chou to the crisis rose.<br> Wu viewed their multitudes with fear,<br> But Shang-fu's words soon gave him cheer:—<br> "With you is God; your doubts dispel.<br> With Him as helper, we shall quell<br>     The pride of all our foes."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Vast was the plain.
