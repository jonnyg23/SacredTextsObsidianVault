 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ts‘ai Wei;</i> allusive and narrative. An ode on the dispatch of troops to guard the frontiers on the north against the wild tribes of the Hsien-yün.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>Come pluck the ferns, the ferns sharp-pointed take;<br> The curling fronds now their appearance make.<br> And now we march. O when shall we return?<br> Till late next year we must in exile mourn.<br> So long the husband, parted from his wife,<br> Shall ’gainst the Hsien-yün wage the deadly strife.<br> ’Mid service hard all rest will be denied;—<br> Northwards we go, to quell the Hsien-yün’s pride.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Come pluck the ferns, the ferns sharp-pointed pull;<br> Their fronds uncurled, they tender look and cool.<br> Onwards we march. O when shall we return?<br> Disconsolate, our hearts in sadness mourn.<br> Yes, sad our hearts! In sorrow forth we go,<br> To thirst and hunger and each pinching woe. <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a><br> While serving thus the frontiers to defend,<br> To those at home no message can we send.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Come pluck the ferns, their sharp points disregard;<br> Some time has passed, and now their leaves are hard.<br> What is the date for our return assigned?<br> Next year's tenth month.—We keep it well in mind.<br> But the king's work no grudging heart requires;<br> Denied our rest, we fan our valor's fires.<br> Home thoughts may often cause us weary hours,<br> But home we go not, till success is ours.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>What gorgeous sight was that which fixed our gaze?<br> The mass of flowers the cherry tree displays.<br> But here a sight we see, as fair and grand;—<br> Our leader's car, given by his sovereign's hand.<br> It stands equipt, imposing in our sight,<br> With steeds all strong, and eager for the fight. <a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a><br> And shall not we the inspiration own?<br> One month our arms with victories three shall crown.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Grand are those four steeds, harnessed to the car!<br> Conducted this, we boldly dare the war.<br> With confidence the general takes his seat;<br> The men behind rejoice the foe to meet.<br> On move the steeds in step. The quiver made<br> Of sealskin tough is to the view displayed,<br> And bow with ivory ends,—the Hsien-yün’s dread.<br> Daily each other's courage we provoke,<br> And hope to end our service by a stroke.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Ah! vain our efforts to assuage our grief!<br> None know our sadness; nought can give relief.<br> Last year, when from our homes the field we took,<br> ’Twas sweet on willows fresh and green to look.<br> When we return, ’twill be the winter stern,<br> And hard our path through snow clouds to discern.<br> Alas! how great the toilsome journey's length,<br> With thirst and hunger to exhaust our strength!</p></div>
