 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Well matched in their strength were the horses, and black,<br> And trained to the reins, as they tighten or slack.<br> Ere the sixth month was o’er, the field we could take;<br> No more preparation we needed to make.<br> With all our accouterments fully complete,<br> Each day thirty li went our hurrying feet.<br> The king gave the word; we were mustered and gone,<br> With courage all ardent to help Heaven's son.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Long and stout were the steeds, attached to each car,<br> With broad heads that scented the battle afar.<br> We smote the Hsien-yün, and great merit obtained,<br> Nor flagged in our efforts till triumph was gained.<br> The eye of our leader was careful and stern,<br> Discharging his service, bright glory to earn; <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></a><br> Determined the war to such issue to bring,<br> As would firmly establish the throne of the king.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>For themselves badly judging, the Hsien-yün go,<br> Bold to occupy Chiao, and seize upon Ho.<br> Hao and Fang they o’erran, still issuing forth,<br> Till, crossing the King, they pressed onto the north.<br> Our flags showed the falcons in blazonry bright,<br> And gayly their streamers all fluttered in white.<br> Ten chariots of war, all imposing and strong,<br> Led proudly the van of our conquering throng.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>The workmen had labored to perfect each car,<br> Well balanced, before and behind, for the war.<br> Its four steeds were mighty, unmatched in their strain,<br> And yielding at once to each touch of the rein.<br> We smote the Hsien-yün; ay, we conquered, and then<br> We pursued them in flight to the far T‘a-yüan.<br> As in peace, so in war, our Chi-fu is great,<br> Affording a pattern to all in each state. <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>And now at the banquet, forgotten all care,<br> He feasts with his friends, feeling happiness rare.<br> The tedious marches are all over now,—<br> The marches we traveled, returning from Hao.<br> To his friends the bright spirits his welcome convey;<br> Minced carp and roast turtle the mats all display.<br> And who are the guests? There above every other<br> Sits Chang Chung, renowned as a son and a brother.</p></div>
