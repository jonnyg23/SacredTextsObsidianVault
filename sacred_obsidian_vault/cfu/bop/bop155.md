 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Shih Chiu;</i> allusive. The praise of some one, some earl, probably of Ts'ao, uniformly of virtuous conduct and of extensive influence.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The mulberry tree still gives the dove to sight,<br> But to the plum her young have taken flight.<br> So is that princely man to virtue bound,<br> Who ever with his 'silken sash is found. <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></a><br> In silken girdle loves he to appear,<br> And bonnet made from skin of spotted deer.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>See on the mulberry tree the dove still sit,<br> And on the hazel all her young ones flit.<br> So on his aim that princely man is set,<br> Who rectifies the people of our state.<br> His laws to all affairs such order give;—<br> Ten thousand years in vigor may he live!</p></div>
