 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Mien;</i> metaphorical and narrative. The small beginnings and subsequent growth of the house of Chou. Its removal from Pin under T‘an-f u, and settlement in Chou, down to the time of King Wên.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>As grow the gourds, with ever length’ning stem.<br> From elder sires sprang ours, as we from them.<br> When first by Chü and Ch‘i our people grew,<br> And o’er them ruled the ancient Duke T‘an-fu,<br> There kilnlike huts and caves for them he made,<br> Ere any house its walls and roof displayed.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>The ancient Duke T‘an-fu came with the morn,<br> In car along the western rivers borne,<br> Nor stayed his steeds, until he reached Mount Ch‘i.<br> The Lady Chiang came in his company. <a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="green">p. 339</font></a><br> With eager eyes they traveled o’er the ground,<br> To find a site on which a town to found.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The plain of Chou, with violets o’erspread<br> And sonchus plants found sweet on such a bed,<br> Lay wide and rich. He asked his men their mind,<br> And by the scorched tortoise shell divined.<br> Both answer gave:—"Now is the time and here!"<br> His followers straight their homes began to rear.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>He cheered them on, and placed them on the land,<br> On left and right their different sites he planned.<br> Divisions, large and small, soon marked the plain,<br> And channels, or to irrigate or drain.<br> From east to west the acres he defined;<br> Nought that was needed ’scaped his active mind.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>He named two officers who should preside<br> O’er all these labors, and the people guide.<br> These to direct the building work he calls;<br> True to the plummet rise the many walls. <a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="green">p. 340</font></a><br> They bind the frame boards, till they stand aright,<br> And rear th’ ancestral temple in its might.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>With earth in baskets crowding workmen came,<br> Which then with shouts they cast into the frame.<br> There with responsive blows the earth they pound,<br> And trim and pare until the walls are sound.<br> At once, five thousand cubits long, these rise,<br> The drum unheard amidst the toilers’ cries.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>The palace next they built. Its outer gate<br> Arose with lofty and imposing state.<br> The inner portal of the court they reared,<br> With massive pomp. Anon, hard by, appeared<br> The altar for the spirits of the land,<br> Where the state's greatest movements should be planned.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>Thus though his foeman's rage he could not tame,<br> T‘an-fu preserved and left a noble fame. <a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></a><br> In time the oaks and thorns were cleared away,<br> And roads for travelers opened to the day.<br> The savage hordes of Hun all disappeared,<br> Panting, and trembling at the name they feared.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_9">9</a></font></span>Then came King Wên, and stirred to nobler life<br> The chiefs of Joo and Juy, who ceased their strife.<br> Some sought our prince, whom yet they had not seen;<br> Some, led by those who at his court had been;<br> Some came who dreaded his avenging arm;<br> And some, who knew he screened the weak from harm.</p></div>
