 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chien Hsi;</i> narrative and allusive. Half in scorn, half in sorrow, an officer of Wei tells of the mean services in which he was employed.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>With figure large I in the courtyard dance.<br> And the duke smiles, when he beholds me prance.<br> A tiger's strength I have; the steeds swift bound;<br> The reins as ribbons in my hands are found.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>See how I hold the flute in my left hand;<br> In right the pheasant's plume, waved like a wand;<br> With visage red, where rouge you think to trace,<br> While the duke pleased, sends down the cup of grace!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>Hazels on hills; the <i>ling</i> in meadow damp;—<br> Each has its place, while I'm a slighted scamp.<br> My thoughts go back to th’ early days of Chou,<br> And muse upon its chiefs, not equaled now.<br> O noble chiefs, who then the west adorned,<br> Would ye have thus neglected me and scorned?</p></div>
