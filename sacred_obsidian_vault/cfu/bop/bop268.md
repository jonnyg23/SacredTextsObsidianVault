 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Sung Kao;</i> narrative. Celebrating the appointment by King Hsüan of a relative to be the marquis of Shên, and defender of the southern border of the kingdom, with the arrangements made for his entering on his charge.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>How grand and high, with hugest bulk, arise<br> Those southern hills whose summits touch the skies!<br> Down from them came a spirit to the earth,<br> And to the sires of Fu and Shên gave birth.<br> In those two states our Chou a bulwark has,<br> O’er which the southern foemen dare not pass;<br> And all its states they screen, and through them spread<br> Lessons of virtue, by themselves displayed.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Famed for his merit was Shên's present chief.<br> The king with Hsieh planned to enlarge his fief.<br> There, as his sires elsewhere had been, should he<br> To all the southern states a pattern be.<br> The earl of Chao got charge there to provide<br> The capital, where Shên's chief should preside,<br> And o’er the south a powerful influence gain.<br> There too his sons that influence should maintain. <a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="green">p. 409</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Thus to the chief the king gave his command:—<br> "A pattern be to all the southern land.<br> Your center Hsieh, go from it onwards, till<br> Your merit all that southern sphere shall fill."<br> Chao's earl was charged the new lands to define,<br> And by Chou's rules fit revenue assign.<br> The master of Shên's household orders got,<br> To move betimes the harem to the spot.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The earl of Chao thus the foundation cleared,<br> On which the chief's great merit should be reared.<br> The city's walls he built, and then went on<br> To build the temple. This work grandly done,<br> The chief receives four steeds, a noble team,<br> Whose breasthooks ’mid their trappings brightly gleam.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Those steeds were with a car of state well matched,<br> And then the king from court the chief dispatched. <a name="page_410"><font size="1" color="green">p. 410</font></a><br> "Your residence," he said, "has been my care.<br> The south I chose. Quick thither now repair.<br> And take this noble mace, which I confer,<br> The symbol of your rank. Go, uncle, go;<br> Protect the southern lands from every foe."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Soon now the chief his way took from the north.<br> The king in Mei the parting feast set forth.<br> Thence, through the capital and southward bound,<br> The chief of Shên in Hsieh at last was found.<br> When Chao's earl the country had defined,<br> And by Chou's rules the revenue assigned,<br> Stores of provisions had been laid aside,<br> For the chief's rapid journey to provide.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Chariots and thronging footmen were arrayed;<br> With martial pomp the chief his entrance made.<br> The states of Chou rejoice. They haste to bring<br> Their warm and joyous greetings to the king.<br> "In your great uncle," thus they say, "you've found<br> A bulwark strong. Grandly is Shên renowned!<br> In peace and war a pattern good will he,<br> Throughout our regions, to your chieftains be." <a name="page_411"><font size="1" color="green">p. 411</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_8">8</a></font></span>With virtue clad, the chief of Shên shines bright;—<br> Though mild, not weak; though strong, yet ever right.<br> Our myriad states his powerful sway shall own,<br> And with their praises his grand merit crown.<br> Chi-fu presents this song, well meant, well made;—<br> Accept, O chief, the tribute I have paid!</p></div>
