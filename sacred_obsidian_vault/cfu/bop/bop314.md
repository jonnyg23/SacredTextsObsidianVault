Celebrating the war of Wu-ting against King-ch‘u, its success, and the general happiness and virtue of his reign;—made, probably, when a special and permanent temple was made for him as the Kao Tsung, "the High and Honored" king of Shang.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>  "Ye people," thus to King-ch‘u’s hosts he said,<br>   "My kingdom's southern part your home have made.<br>   Of old, when the successful Tang bore sway,<br>   The states made haste their offerings to pay.<br>   The distant Ch'iang of Ti in homage came;<br>   No chief then dared deny our sovereign claim.<br>   Shall ye, who dwell much nearer than the Ch‘iang,<br> Transgress what long has been th’ unvaried rule of Shang?</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>  Eager we climbed the King hill near at hand,<br>   Where round and straight the pine and cypress stand.<br>   We felled these to the ground, and hither brought,<br>   And, reverent, hewed them to the shape we sought.<br>   Long from the wall project the beams of pine,<br>   And numerous rise the pillars, large and fine;—<br> So have we built this house for Wu-ting's peaceful shrine.</p></div>
