 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ta Tung;</i> allusive. An officer, of one of the states of the east, deplores the exactions made from them by the government; complains of the favor shown to the west; contrasts the misery of the present with the happiness of the past; and appeals to the stars of heaven idly beholding their condition.</div>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_1">1</a></font></span>With millet filled, the dishes stood displayed;<br> The spoons lay long and curved, of thornwood made.<br> Smooth as a whetstone was the road to Chou,<br> And straight as shaft well fitted for the bow.<br> This road the common people gladly viewed;<br> The officers on it their way pursued.<br> Thus back to former times my thoughts will go,<br> And down my cheeks the tears in streamlets flow.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Now in the east, in states both large and small,<br> Shuttles unplied, the looms are empty all.<br> Thin cloth of dolichos supplies the shoes,<br> Which shivering travelers on the hoarfrost use.<br> Young nobles, cultured, but too thin and spare,<br> Hurry along the road, all full of care.<br> They go, they come; weary they are and worn.<br> My heart aches for them, and I feel forlorn. <a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>This firewood, cut and hewn with earnest toil,<br> I fear the waters from that spring will spoil.<br> Fit then as emblems they would be of those<br> Whose stern exactions grant us no repose.<br> The firewood cut must homeward be conveyed;—<br> Toil after toil is on the people laid.<br> O that we could the needful rest but take!<br> Tired out we sleep, and sigh when we awake.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The east its noblest sons to service hard<br> Sees promptly called; but they get no reward.<br> There in the west sons of each noble line<br> Live idle, and in splendid dresses shine.<br> There also boatmen's sons now proudly wear<br> The glossy furs of which men spoil the bear.<br> Sons of the poorest families, elate,<br> In public offices display their state.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_5">5</a></font></span>Our choicest spirits humbly we present.<br> "How can such stuff," they say, "our taste content?"<br> Long girdle pendants, well supplied with gems, <a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a><br> We give, and each the gift as short contemns.<br> Up to the Milky Way I turn my gaze;—<br> Looks it not down to mark their evil ways?<br> There too the Weaving Sisters’ triple beam,<br> While they move on, might shed an angry gleam.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_6">6</a></font></span>Nightly those Sisters through seven stages go,<br> But no bright work do they to ease our woe.<br> The stars we call Draft Oxen also shine,<br> But they no cart for us to draw combine.<br> The Morning Star appears in the dim east,<br> The Evening Star oft twinkles in the west,<br> And long and curved the Rabbit Net is there:—<br> Each fills its place, but heeds not our despair.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_7">7</a></font></span>Four stars to be the Southern Sieve have claim,<br> But nothing do they to make good the name.<br> Northwards the Ladle sparkles in the sky,<br> But ladles nothing that may drink supply.<br> O Southern Sieve, thy mouth is idly shown,<br> For good come from it we have never known.<br> And thou, O Ladle, shining in the north,<br> Thy handle eastward vainly stretchest forth!</p></div>
