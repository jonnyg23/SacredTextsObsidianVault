His car four piebalds drew,<br> That moved like one great steed to human view.<br> A royal gift, it shone in glittering red,<br> With bamboo-checkered screen, and quiver made<br> Of sealskin strong. The gilt hooks we could tell<br> On each steed's breast; the rein ends graceful fell.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Where toil last year had opened harvests new,<br> And where about the villages it grew,<br> White millet there they reaped with eager hand,<br> When Fang Shu came, the army to command.<br> His cars three thousand; on his banners shone<br> Snake, tortoise, dragon, as he led them on.<br> Gay was his yoke; his naves were lacquered red;<br> Two tinkling bells hung from each horse's head.<br> He wore the robes the king's gift had bestowed;<br> Beneath, the red knee covers brightly glowed.<br> Rare gems upon his girdle pendant hung,<br> Flashed as they moved, and sounded as they swung. <a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Swift as the soaring falcon cleaves the sky,<br> And wheels about in airy circles high,<br> Descending then, and lighting where it rose;<br> So Fang Shu led his troops against their foes.<br> Round the war chariots, full three thousand strong,<br> Close marched the men, a well-trained warrior throng.<br> The bells and drums his orders clear expressed,<br> And then the marshaled forces he addressed,<br> And wise arrangements made. The battle raged,<br> While the drums rolled, inspiring all engaged.<br> Victory once gained, a lighter sound they gave,<br> The while he ordered back the victors brave.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The savage hordes of King, made blind by fate,<br> Had madly dared to oppose our larger state.<br> Although Fang Shu was ripe with growing years,<br> Yet in his plans a vigorous force appears.<br> Leading his troops, the hostile chiefs he bound <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a><br> For question, with a captive crowd around.<br> How numerous were his chariots in the fray,<br> Numerous, and all arrayed in grand array,<br> Like rattling thunder in assaulting speed!<br> Oh! grand in wisdom was he as in deed!<br> The Hsien-yün he had smitten to the ground;<br> The awe-struck tribes of King his prowess owned.</p></div>
