 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Hsing Wei;</i> allusive and narrative. A festal ode, celebrating some entertainment given by the king to his relatives, with the trial of archery after the feast; celebrating especially the honor done on such occasions to the aged.</div>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Lo! double mats are spread,<br>   And stools are featly set.<br> Servants in waiting stand;<br>   See host and guests are met.<br> He pledges them; they him;<br>   He drinks; again they fill.<br> Sauces and pickles come,<br>   Roast meat and broiled; and still<br> Palates and tripe are brought.<br>   Then lutes and drums appear.<br> Singers fine concord make;—<br>   The joyous feasters hear.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>The feasting o’er, from bow,<br>   Lacquered and strong and bright,<br> Four well-poised shafts each sends,<br>   That in the target light. <a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="green">p. 364</font></a><br> The guests are ranged as they<br>   The mark have nearest hit.<br> They shoot again; the shafts<br>   Are fairly lodged in it.<br> Their bearing then is judged;<br>   Each takes his final place,<br> As mild propriety<br>   Has round him thrown its grace.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_4">4</a></font></span>The long-descended king<br>   Presides, and ends the feast.<br> With spirits sweet and strong<br>   From vase he cheers each guest.<br> And for the old he prays,<br>   While all with rapture glow,<br> That they the wrinkled back<br>   And whitening hair may show;<br> Striving with mutual help<br>   In virtue's onward ways,<br> And brightest happiness<br>   Thus crown their latest days.</p></div>
