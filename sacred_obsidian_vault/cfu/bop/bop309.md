 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Pi Kung;</i> narrative. In praise of Duke Hsi, and auguring for him a magnificent career of success, which would make Lu all that it had ever been:—written probably on an occasion when Hsi had repaired on a grand scale the temples of the state, of which pious act his success would be the reward.</div>

So did she share<br> God's favor, and Hou-chi she bore,<br> Without a pang, or labor sore,<br> Just when her carrying days were o’er.<br> On Hou-chi then all blessings came. <a name="page_471"><font size="1" color="green">p. 471</font></a><br> That millets’ times were not the same,<br> This ripening quickly, and that slow,<br> He knew, and first the pulse to sow,<br> And then the wheat, where each should grow.<br> Soon called a state, though small, to rule,<br> It under him became a school,<br> Where husbandry men learned to know,<br> To sow, to reap, to weed, to hoe.<br> Millets,—the early, black, and red,<br> And rice that loves the watery bed;—<br> All these through all the land were known,<br> And of Yin's toils the worth was shown.  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_2">2</a></font></span>Long after Hou-chi, in his line,<br> King Ta arose, quick to divine<br> Heaven's will, who eastward came and dwelt<br> South of Mount Ch‘i. There first was felt<br> The power of Chou, and Shang's fierce sway<br> Began to dwindle and decay.<br> From him we pass to Wên and Wu,<br> Continuing Ta's great work to do,<br> Till in the plain of Mu ’twas given<br> To see th’ accomplished will of Heaven. <a name="page_472"><font size="1" color="green">p. 472</font></a><br> There met the hosts, both well arrayed,<br> And when Wu feared, his general said,<br> "Let not a doubt your mind possess!<br> With you is God, your arms to bless."<br> The troops of Shang defeat sustained;<br> Wu's men, all fire, grand victory gained.<br> His son, King Ch‘êng, next wore the crown,<br> And said to Tan of wide renown,<br> Still as the duke of Chou well known,<br> "Your eldest son, O uncle great,<br> I will appoint to rule the state<br> Of Lu, and there on your bestow<br> A territory that shall grow,<br> And help afford our house of Chou."</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_3">3</a></font></span>Thus first did Lu a ruler get,<br> Who marquis in the east was set.<br> The lands and fields, each stream and hill,<br> Were granted to him, at his will<br> To hold, and many states attached,<br> Whose fealty jealously he watched. <a name="page_473"><font size="1" color="green">p. 473</font></a><br> From him derived, our present chief,<br> Son of Duke Chuang, now holds the fief.<br> With dragon banner raised aloft,<br> Grasping the pliant reins and soft,<br> Here comes he sacrifice to pay.<br> In spring and autumn, no delay<br> He makes; but soon as dawns the day,<br> Correct his offerings appear;—<br> The victims, red and pure, are here:—<br> First for the great and sovereign Lord,<br> Then for Hou-chi, our sire adored.<br> The victims these enjoy and own,<br> And send abundant blessings down.<br> Nor they alone, O prince, do so,<br> But from the duke of Chou gifts flow,<br> And all your sires their grace bestow.</p>
