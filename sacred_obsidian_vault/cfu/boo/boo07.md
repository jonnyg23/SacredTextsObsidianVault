 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wăn</span> drew a tower of bold ascent,<br> A tower of lofty size.<br> In crowds the zealous builders went,<br> The walls began to rise.<br> "Haste not," said he, when first the work began;<br> But all the people were as sons of Wăn.</p>  
 <p>The King was in the wondrous park,<br> The does so sleek and brown<br> Lay couched in fern; from dawn to dark<br> White birds came glistening down;<br> The King was by the pond whose waters hold<br> A thousand carp with ruddy scales of gold.</p>  
 <p>Upon his posts the fretted board<br> Is hung with drums and bells;<br> What music chimes from their accord,<br> What sound of laughter swells<br> From the pavilion of the circling pool<br> Where joy and Wăn, the brother monarchs, rule</p>  
 <p>What harmony of bells and drums!<br> What call of drums and bells!<br> Beyond the flaming water comes<br> What sound of happy spells.<br> The blind musicians blind us with delight;<br> While the deep lizard drums roll on till night.</p>
