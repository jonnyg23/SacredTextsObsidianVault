 <p align="center"><small>THE FILIAL DUTY OF AN EMPEROR</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> order to prevent the people from treating their parents with cruelty, the Emperor first sets an example to them by showing a dear love to his mother; and in order to teach them not to treat their parents with rudeness, he first treats his parents with respect. Having loved and respected his own parents, his good conduct will influence the minds of his people, and his good example will be followed by them.</p>  
 <p>So it is written in the <i>Fu Hsin</i>g <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">2</font></a>: "When the Emperor has done a good act, millions will be benefited."</p>
