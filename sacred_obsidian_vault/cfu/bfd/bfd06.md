 <p align="center"><small>THE FILIAL DUTY OF FEUDAL PRINCES</small></p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Any</span> man will be secure in his position, however high it may be, if he does not behave himself in a haughty manner; and will be ever able to keep his wealth if he is frugal and careful in his expenses.</p>  
 <p>When he is able to secure himself in his high position, he can, of course, remain unimpaired in his dignity; and where he can keep his wealth, he will always remain rich. Having placed himself in a position of honour, and secured the possession of his wealth, he will be able to protect his country and further the welfare of his people. This is the filial duty of a feudal Prince.</p>  
 <p>In the <i>Shih Ching</i> it is thus written: "Be careful as though you were standing upon the brink of a high precipice or treading on thin ice."</p>
