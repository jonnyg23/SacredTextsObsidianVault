 <p>A woman who lived in a country town wished to sell her house and furniture. It was in the winter with snow so deep it was almost impossible for cars or wagons to reach her door.</p>  
 <p>As she had asked God to sell her furniture to the right person for the right price she was unmindful of appearances.</p>  
 <p>She polished the furniture, pushed it into the middle of the room and prepared to sell it.</p>  
 <p>She said: "I never looked out of the window at the blizzard, I simply trusted God's promises."</p>  
 <p>In miraculous ways people drove up and all the furniture was sold, and the house also, without paying any commission to an agent.</p>  
 <p>Faith never looks out of the window at the blizzard, it simply prepares for the blessing asked for.</p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATION</h4>  
 <p>I give thanks that this article (or property) is now sold to the right person or persons for the right price, giving perfect satisfaction.</p>
