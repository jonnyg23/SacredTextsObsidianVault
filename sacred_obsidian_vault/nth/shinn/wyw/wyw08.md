 <p></p>  <h3 align="center">WORDS OF WISDOM</h3>  
 <p align="center"></p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
 <p>"Faith without nerve is dead."</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>There is never a slip twixt the right cup and the right lip.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Never look or you'd never leap.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>God works in unexpected places, through unexpected people, at unexpected times, His wonders to perform.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Power moves but is never moved. </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Loving your neighbor means not to limit your neighbor in word, thought or deed.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>"Never argue with a hunch."</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Christopher Columbus followed a hunch.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is the realm of perfect ideas.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>It is dark before the dawn but the dawn never fails. Trust in the dawn.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>When in doubt play trumps, <i>do the fearless thing</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>It is the fearless things that count.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Never do today what intuition says to do tomorrow. </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>It's a great life if you don't reason.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Regard your neighbor as yourself.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Never hinder another's hunch.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Selfishness binds and blocks. Every loving and unselfish thought has in it the germ of success.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Be not weary of make-believing. When you least expect it you shall reap.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Faith is elastic. Stretch it to the end of your demonstration.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Before you call you are answered, for the supply precedes the demand.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>What you do for others you are doing for yourself. </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Every act committed while angry or resentful brings unhappy reaction.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Sorrow and disappointment follow in the wake of deceit and subterfuge. The way of the transgressor is hard. "No good thing will be withheld from him who <i>walks uprightly</i>."</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>There is no power in evil. It is nothing; therefore can only come to nothing.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Fear and impatience demagnetize. Poise magnetizes.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Drown the reasoning mind with your affirmation. Jehoshaphat clapped his cymbals so that he wouldn't hear himself think.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>All bondage is an illusion of the race consciousness. There is always a way out of every situation, under grace. Every man is free to do the will of God. </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Sure-ism is stronger than Optimism.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>"Divine ideas never conflict."</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>It is dangerous to stop in the middle of a <i>hunch</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Infinite Spirit</i> is never too late.</p>
