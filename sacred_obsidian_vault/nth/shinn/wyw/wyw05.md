 <p></p>  <h3 align="center">LOVE</h3>  
 <p>With love usually comes terrific fear. Nearly every woman comes into the world with a mythical woman in the back of her mind who is to rob her of her love.</p>  
 <p>She has been called "the other woman." Of course it comes from woman's belief in duality. So long as she visualizes interference, it will come.</p>  
 <p>It is usually very difficult for a woman to see herself loved by the man she loves, so these affirmations are to impress the truth of the situation upon her subconscious mind, for in reality there is <i>only oneness</i>.</p>  
 <p>(See <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.)</p>

 <p>As I am one with God, the Undivided One, I am one with my undivided love and undivided happiness.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>The Light of the Christ within now wipes out all fear, doubt, anger and resentment. God's love pours through me, an irresistible magnetic current. I see only perfection and draw to me my own.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Divine Love, through me, now dissolves all seeming obstacles and makes clear, easy and successful my way.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I love everyone and everyone loves me. My apparent enemy becomes my friend, a golden link in the chain of my good.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I am at peace with myself and with the whole world. I love everyone and everyone loves me.</p>  
 <p><i>The flood gates of my good now open</i>.</p>
