 <p></p>  <h3 align="center">DEBT</h3>  
 <p>If a man is in debt or people owe him money, it shows that a belief of debt is in his subconscious mind.</p>  
 <p>This belief must be neutralized in order to change conditions.</p>  
 <p>For example: A woman came to me saying a man had owed her a thousand dollars for years which she could not compel him to pay.</p>  
 <p>I said: "You must work on yourself, not the man," and gave her this statement: "I deny debt, there is no debt in Divine Mind, no man owes me anything, all is squared. I send that man love and forgiveness."</p>  
 <p>In a few weeks she received a letter from him saying he intended sending the money and in about a month came the thousand dollars.</p>  
 <p>If the student owes money, change the statement: "There is no debt in Divine Mind, therefore, I owe no man anything, all is <i>squared</i>.</p>  
 <p>All my obligations are now wiped out, under grace in a perfect way." </p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
 <p>I deny debt, there is no debt in Divine Mind, therefore, I owe no man anything.</p>  
 <p>All obligations are now wiped out under grace in a miraculous way.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I deny debt, there is no debt in Divine Mind, no man owes me anything, all is squared. I send forth love and forgiveness.</p>
