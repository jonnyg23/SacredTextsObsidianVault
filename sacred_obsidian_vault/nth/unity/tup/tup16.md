 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>In the presence and power of the Christ in me I decree the<br> manifestation of perfect health.<br> In the presence and power of the living Christ substance I<br> claim the riches of God.<br> </small></div>  
 <p>GOD MADE man by the power of His word: "God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." By virtue of his spiritual origin and the power vested in him man forms by his word the world in which he lives. Jehovah said to Eliphaz, "Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee." </p> 
 <p>Every word man utters energizes the ether with a creative impulse that in due season brings forth its image and likeness. </p> 
 <p>The formative power of man's thought and word is governed by his faith in himself and the vehemence with which he thinks and speaks. </p> 
 <p>Jesus expected great things of His followers because He knew what is in man. He knew that man has laid hold of the power of God, as stated in Genesis 3:22, "Behold, the man is become as one </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p> 
 <p>of us." Jesus recognized this when He said, "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?" </p> 
 <p>We have not brought forth in the majesty of the sons of God because of our self-depreciation and our ignorance of the creative law implanted in us. Job had the inferiority complex of personality. He whined: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? .<br> . .<br> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br> Gird up thy lions now like a man:<br> I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me . . .<br> Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity;<br> And array thyself with honor and majesty."<br> </small></div>  
 <p>Isaiah said, "Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees." Our woes can be traced right back to some unrighteous decree. We have decreed a thousand things that we did not want to come to pass, but that have come to pass, and we are suffering the woeful consequences. </p> 
 <p>Our body is weak or strong, according to what we have decreed for it. Every organ is functioning as we have decreed. If we have said, "My stomach is weak,'" the obedient life and substance have found this kind of stomach for us. If we have declared strength and vigor for our stomach, this organ will at once begin to carry out our decree. "Say the word, and my servant shall be healed." </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></a></p> 
 <p>So every organ and member of the body responds to our decree. </p> 
 <p>Man is the anointed son of God called Christ. When we know the truth about ourselves we are freed from the bondage of the foolish decrees of personality. Do not exalt personality in your decrees for yourself. Exalt Christ by making your decrees in His name. "Christ in you, the hope of glory." </p> 
 <p>The vital energy of eternal life exists in every cell of our body. Science proclaims that its experiments with animal tissues prove that man's body would live forever if it were not for his brain. In a recent interview Doctor Carrel says that "the only thing that keeps men from living forever is the possession of a brain and nervous system." </p> 
 <p>Metaphysicians know that the brain and nervous system are the organ of the mind, and that man dies because he is not wise in his directive power. </p>

 <p>was the prosperity proclamation of our wise old friend Job. </p> 
 <p>A "depression" took everything he owned, even his sons and daughters. But he was not defeated, he claimed his own and it was restored to him: </p> 
 <p>
 </p><p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak;<br> I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me . . .<br> And Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before."<br> </small></div>
