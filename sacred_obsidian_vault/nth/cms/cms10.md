 <p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 17</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">WHAT WE WILL ATTRACT.</h3>  
 <p>WE will always attract to us, in our lives and conditions, according to our thought. Things are but outer manifestations of inner mental concepts. Thought is not only power; it is also the form of all things. The conditions that we attract will correspond exactly to our mental pictures. It is quite necessary, then, that the successful business man should keep his mind on thoughts of happiness, which produce cheerfulness instead of depression; he should radiate joy, and should be filled with faith, hope and expectancy. These cheerful, hopeful attitudes of mind are indispensable to the one who really wants to do things in life.</p>  
 <p>Put every negative thought out of your mind once and for all. Declare your freedom. Know that no matter what others may say, think or do, <i>you are a success</i>, now, and nothing can hinder you from accomplishing your good.</p>  
 <p>All the power of the universe is with you; feel it, know it, and then act as though it were true. This mental attitude alone will draw people and things to you.</p>  
 <p>Begin to blot out, one by one, all false beliefs, all idea that man is limited or poor or miserable. Use that wonderful power of will that God has given to you. Refuse to think of failure or to doubt your own power.</p>  
 <p>See only what you wish to experience, and look at nothing else. No matter how many times the old thought returns, destroy it by knowing that it has no power over you; look it squarely in the face and tell it to go; it does not belong to you, and you must know--and stick to it--that you are now free.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>Rise up in all the faith of one who knows what he is dealing with, and declare that you are one with Infinite Mind. Know that you cannot get away from this One Mind; that wherever you may go, there, right beside you, waiting to be used, is all the power there is in the whole universe. When you realize this you will know that in union with this, the only power, <i>you</i> are more than all else, you are more than anything that can ever happen <i>to you</i>.</p>
