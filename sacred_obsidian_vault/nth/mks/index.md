 </p><dir><small>"Spirituality" is quite "practical," very "practical," intensely "practical." It teaches that Spirit is the Real Thing, the Whole Thing, and that Matter is but plastic stuff, which Spirit is able to create, mould, manipulate, and fashion to its will. Spirituality is the most "practical" thing in the world--the only really and absolutely "practical" thing that there is!--p. 304, para. 21.</small></dir>

 Is there a secret behind the Secret?
 If so, this might be it.
 Haanel, a somewhat mysterious figure who
 was what we would today call a business development consultant,
 wrote this series of lessons shortly after World War I.
 This turbulent time was made even more miserable by
 a flu pandemic which killed millions.
 Many were searching for a royal road
 to prosperity, health and inner peace, and Haanel's book
 held out this promise.
 </p>
 <p>
 For years, urban legends have swirled around this book: 
 that it was banned by some religious groups, and
 central to the success of a certain well-known software tycoon.
 I was unable to confirm or disprove any of these rumors.
 However, the Master Key System has had a huge influence on
 successive New Thought writers,
 particularly those preaching 'Prosperity Consciousness.'
 <a href="../tgr/index.htm">Think and Grow Rich</a>
 bears more than a passing resemblance to the Master Key System.
 The 'Law of Attraction' at the heart of Haanel's system has
 been acknowledged as one of the primary sources
 for <cite>The Secret</cite>.
