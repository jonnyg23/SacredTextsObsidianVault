 <p><tt>Dear Mr. Hill:--</tt></p>  
 <p>I have now had an opportunity to finish reading your Law of Success textbooks and I wish to express my appreciation of the splendid work you have done in the organization of this philosophy.</p>  
 <p>It would be helpful if every politician in the country would assimilate and apply the 17 principles upon which your lessons are based. It contains some very fine material which every leader in every walk of life should understand.</p>  
 <p>I am happy to have had the privilege of rendering you some slight measure of help in the. organization of this splendid course of "common sense" philosophy.</p>  
 <p align="right">Sincerely yours</p>

I presume it would be no exaggeration of fact if I said that the Woolworth Building might properly be called a monument to the soundness of these principles."</small></p>
