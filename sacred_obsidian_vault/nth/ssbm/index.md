 Most New Thought proponents look to Western esoteric traditions, or
 possibly to second-hand Hindu or Buddhist concepts.
 Max Freedom Long, on the other hand, was fascinated with the
 shamans of Hawaii, the Kahuna.
 While this is not, by far, an ethnographic account of Hawaiian healing,
 it is informed by anecdote and personal experience in the islands.
 Long spent many years in Hawaii, and besides several books on 'Huna'
 he also apparently wrote several mystery novels in that setting.
 This book, one of the first he wrote on the subject of Huna,
 is typical of the others, and if you like this, you'll probably like his
 other writings.
