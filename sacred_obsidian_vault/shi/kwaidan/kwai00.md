 <h3 align="CENTER">A Note from the Digitizer On Japanese Pronunciation</h3>
 <p>Although simplified, the following general rules will help the reader unfamiliar with Japanese to come close enough to Japanese pronunciation.</p>
 <p>There are five vowels: a (as in fAther), i (as in machIne), u (as in fOOl), e (as in fEllow), and o (as in mOle). Although certain vowels become nearly "silent" in some environments, this phenomenon can be safely ignored for the purpose at hand.</p>
 <p>Consonants roughly approximate their corresponding sounds in English, except for r, which is actually somewhere between r and l (this is why the Japanese have trouble distinguishing between English r and l), and f, which is much closer to h.</p>
 <p>The spelling "KWAIDAN" is based on premodern Japanese pronunciation; when Hearn came to Japan, the orthography reflecting this pronunciation was still in use. In modern Japanese the word is pronounced KAIDAN.</p>
 <p>There are many ellipses in the text. Hearn often used them in this book; they do not represent omissions by the digitizer.</p>
 <p>Author's original notes are in brackets, those by the digitizer are in parentheses. Diacritical marks in the original are absent from this digitized version.</p>
