 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Departing from Naniha on a Mission to China</span></p>  
 <p>E’en as the hart, who ardent woos his mate<br> When the bush-clover opens purple blooms,<br> Hath one son only, even thus am I<br> Mother of only one, who even now<br> On a far journey fares, in a strange land,<br> With but, perchance, grass-pillow for his head.<br> Wherefore close-threaded beads of bamboo rings<br> And brimming jars of saké I set forth,<br> And shining yufu cloths, before the shrine,<br> Praying the mighty God, with humble prayers,<br> To bring my loved one safely home to me!</p>  <h3 align="center">A LAMENT</h3>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu")</p>  
 <p>In the upper reaches of the river,<br> Hatsusé's secluded upper reaches,<br> Dive the eager cormorants, respondent<br> To the will and bidding of their keepers.<br> In the lower waters cormorants diving<br> Many shining fishes let to swallow.</p>  
 <p>Fair and bright was she who now is lying,<br> Parted from me, a full bow-shot, lying,<br> And my heart is burdened down with sorrow,<br> Full of thoughts of her and full of sorrow.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>Rudely torn may be a hempen mantle,<br> Yet a skilful hand may join it fitly;<br> Snapped may be the string where pearls are threaded,<br> Yet the thread all swiftly be re-knotted;<br> But, my dear one, you and I once parted<br> Never more may meet—ah! nevermore!</p>  <h3 align="center">A LAY OF COMPLAINT</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By the Lady Sakanohe no Isatsune</span></p>  
 <p>My Lord had vowed that with deep constancy<br> Firm-rooted as the sturdy sedge that grow<br> In the clear pools of Naniha—so he<br> Would love and guard me through the golden years.<br> I gave my heart to him (ah! foolish heart!<br> Yet stainless as a mirror's burnished face)—<br> Into his keeping, and on him I leaned,<br> Trusting in him, as sailor in his ship<br> Nor, as the drifting seaweed to and fro,<br> Backwards and forwards in the swirling tides,<br> Has my love wavered from that very hour!<br> Yet now, perchance, the mighty gods have willed<br> To part us twain. Or is it evil words<br> Of envious mortals? For he comes no more,<br> My Lord who came so often! neither sends<br> White-wanded messenger to tell me why.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>From the red dawn until the dense night falls,<br> And all the hours of darkness through I weep<br> Hopeless and helpless. Plain for all to see<br> My misery, and weeping like a babe,<br> I wander forth, nor waiting, dare to hope<br> For word or message from the one I love!</p>  <h3 align="center">DROWNED</h3>  
 <p align="center">(Lay 194 from the "Manyôshiu")</p>  
 <p>No bird-songs at dawn-breaking, sound by the lonely sea,<br>    Where sleeps he, never waking;<br> Behind him, faintly looming, the solemn mountains lie;<br>    Before him, waves dull booming.<br> On shining seaweed pillow, he rests on pebbly shore,<br>    Drenched by each wind-tossed billow.<br> Not even mantle closing, with wings of dragon-fly,<br>    Around his form reposing.<br> All lone he lies, as sleeping forgetful of the world,<br>    Of laughter or of weeping.<br> Once loved him—Father, Mother, haply young wife and fair<br>    Loved him above all other.<br> But never word of greeting, from him to them shall pass,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>   Nevermore place of meeting!<br> Vainly a message seeking, homeplace and name tell not<br>    Lips like a babe's unspeaking.<br> Piteous the sight, heart-rending, but such the world's sad way,<br>    All things to silence tending</p>  <h3 align="center">TO A LADY CROSSING A BRIDGE ALONE</h3>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu")</p>  
 <p>Fair lady, tripping o’er yon bridge,<br> Spanning the foaming river's bed,<br> Who, scarlet-robed with mantle blue,<br> Crosses the lacquered arch of red—<br> I wonder, as I watch your form<br> All unattended and alone,<br> If in your homeplace gallant spouse<br> Claims your sweet beauty as his own;<br> Or if like single acorn, still<br> Unmated and forlorn you pine!<br> And nameless still, and still unknown,<br> Your name and dwelling would divine.</p>

 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu"—8th Century)</p>  
 <p>       In Azuma<br> To grace the Imperial Reign<br>      All gold the flowers grow<br>        In Azuma.<br> On all the heights of Michinoku glow<br>      The glittering blooms.<br>    Imperial eyes might deign<br> To glance upon the precious flowers that grow<br>        In Azuma!</p>

 </p>  <h3 align="center">A WISH</h3>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu")</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Prince Aki</span>, A.D. 740</p>  
 <p>  On Isé's sea<br> The white foam-blossoms play.<br>   Would they were blooms<br> From out whose fair array<br>   Choosing the best<br> I might select a spray<br>   For her I love!</p>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Prince Aki</span></p>  
 <p>The Moon is a barque on the sea of the skies,<br> Where stormy and grey the cloud-billows arise,<br> Nor tempest, nor calm, her serenity mars<br> As she glides on her way to the groves of the stars!</p>  <h3 align="center">WILLOWS</h3>  
 <p>     Now ere the rough caress<br> Of the Spring breeze has tangled carelessly<br> The young green willows' slender silken threads,<br> Now would I show them in their fresh young grace<br>             Unto my love!</p>  <h3 align="center">BLOSSOM-TIME</h3>  
 <p>Not yet is past the cherry's blossom-time;<br>   Yet should the petals fall,<br> <i>Now</i>, while their beauty's moon is at the full,<br> And all the love of those who gaze on them<br>          Is at its zenith—</p>

 <p><small>A great minister and scholar; after holding high office, was banished as Governor of Kyūshū, and died in A.D. 903. His death was said to have been followed by evil portents and disasters to his foes. He is worshipped as a God of Calligraphy—and plum-trees are planted near his temple, his crest being plum-blossom.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">THE OFFERING</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Sugiwara no Michizane</span></p>  
 <p>I carry to the Shrine no offering<br>      This Autumn day,<br> Fairer than any gift that I could bring,<br>      The rich display<br> Of gold and crimson on Tamuke's side.<br> The gods can revel in the maples' pride!</p>  <h3 align="center">SPRING SHOWERS</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Fujiwara Toshiyuki</span></p>  
 <p>Through flow’ring branches<br> Pour the sudden showers,<br> Warm showers through branches<br> Sweetly blossoming.<br> What if they soak me,<br> So the glistening flowers<br> Let me partake<br> Their fragrance of the Spring!</p>
