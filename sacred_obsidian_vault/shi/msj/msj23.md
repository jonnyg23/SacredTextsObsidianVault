 <p><small>He was born A.D. 1730 at Matsuzaka-Isé. One of the great names of Japanese literature. He was a pupil of Mabuchi. He was chiefly instrumental in restoring Shintō to its original supremacy, and revived interest in the ancient literature. His works are numerous, one of the greatest being the Commentary on the Kojiki, in forty-four volumes, which is an encyclopedia of ancient literature.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">YAMATO-DAMASHÜ (SOUL OF JAPAN)</h3>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Shiroi Ukō</span></p>  
 <p align="center">(From "Hana Momiji," 1898)</p>  
 <p align="center">PART I</p>  
 <p>Under the shadow of the ancient firs<br> That clothe with sombre green the craggy height,<br> Again the hush of mystic silence stirs:<br> Whose bamboo flute speaks music to the night?<br> Is it some sun-bronzed fisher-lad would sigh<br> For other joys than those his work-day world,<br> Bitter with salt and seaweed, can supply—<br> So pours his soul in music to the sky?</p>  
 <p>Night after night he seeks the fir-grove's shade;<br> To the vague moonbeams filtering from above,<br> To the dense darkness, or the stars displayed,<br> Still sound those yearning cadences of love.<br> And first the fisher's flute was heard to play,<br> When a whole day had passed since courtiers proud<br> Of our great Lord had wandered by this way,<br> And the long night their revelry held sway.<br> They wandered forth upon the beach, the night<br> Rang with keen wit, and laughter unsubdued,<br> The while upon her course of crystal light<br> The Autumn moon's fair barque her course pursued.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>A day had passed, since ladies of our Lord,<br> Mooring their pleasure-barge, in revel gay,<br> Tuned all their golden lutes in sweet accord<br> With the wind's song that through the fir-tops soared.</p>  
 <p align="center">PART II</p>  
 <p>On nights when the dew fell coldly<br>   On the reeds of the sullen shore,<br> He came—and his flute sang boldly<br>   To the waves, and the swirling roar<br> Of the winds of the pines, in the distant crags<br>   As its fierce gusts downward tore.</p>  
 <p>On nights when the hail beat wildly<br>   And the waves on the beach ice-bound,<br> He came—and his flute sang mildly,<br>   Subdued with a mournful sound.</p>  
 <p>On nights when the rain poured madly<br>   And merged with the sea's weird moan,<br> He came—and his flute sang sadly,<br>   Languid and faint of tone.</p>  
 <p align="center">PART III</p>  
 <p>Changed has the Autumn-moon to-night,<br>   So long his love endures, <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a><br> And still with ever-new delight<br>   The bamboo flute allures.</p>  
 <p>   With the wild storm's acclaim,<br>    Troubled its notes became;<br>    Echoes from pine-trees blown,<br>    Clear grew its liquid tone;<br>    Mad with the maddened sea,<br>    Frenzied its song would be!<br>    Stifled with rocks wave-swept,<br>    Dully its slow notes crept.</p>  
 <p>   Even the cloud that floats<br>    Over Onoyé stayed,<br>    Listening to silver notes,<br>    Then to some fainter played.<br>    What wonder, there descends<br>      From the high bower<br>    Some one absorbed in thought<br>      At this still hour!</p>  
 <p>Awhile the flute had ceased to pour<br> Its importunities to earth and sky;<br> But hark! how, louder than before,<br> The music of the bamboo thrills on high.<br> Now a new harmony the air pervades,<br> And in accord, how sweetly! with the flute;<br> Clear as the trill of warbler in the glades<br> Ring the soft accents of a golden lute!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>Sometime the clouds from Onoyé descending<br> From the pine-scented rocks beneath them bore,<br> On their wide wings, the sweet musicians, tending<br> To those fair seas whereon, with altered helm,<br> The moon's fair barque steered straight towards them, wending<br> Her course eternal to the eternal Realm.</p>
