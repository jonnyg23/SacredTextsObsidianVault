 <p><small>Known as the Prince of the Manyôshiu poets. Was said to be descended either from the Mikado Kōshō (B.C. 475-393), or the Mikado Bidatsu (B.C. 572-83). He served under the Queen-regnant Jito—A.D. 694-6—and the Mikado Mommu (697-707). He travelled with Prince Nihitabe over a large part of Japan, and composed many poems—A.D. 673-86. He died at Ihami.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">ON THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE</h3>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu")</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Hitómaro</span></p>  
 <p>When hand in hand, we two did wend<br> Adown the paths of Life our way,<br> And from the dike's ridge yonder, gazed<br> On the dense elm-trees' green array,<br> From out whose leafy canopy,<br> Glimpsed here and there, our cottage eaves;<br> Then were our tender thoughts of love,<br> Frequent as are the fresh spring leaves<br>   Upon the tangled boughs.</p>

 <p>Leaning on thee; my very soul<br> Rested in perfect trust on thee.<br> Sad is the doom that none may shun,<br> Mournful the fate that none may flee!<br> Over the far-flung purple moor,<br> 'Midst the white funeral banners borne,<br> Slowly they take thee, thou who rose<br> With the wild-fowl at break of dawn,<br> And they must hide thee far away,<br> As sunset-hills hide out the day.<br> Thy little son, a memory<br> Of thy dear self, weeps bitter tears,<br> And seeks for comfort in my arms.<br> I fondle him, to soothe his fears;<br> But with a man's unskilful hand,<br> Lacking the tender touch that cheers.<br> Our chamber, now so desolate,<br> Where once all close our pillows lay!<br> The night is filled with loneliness,<br> And sorrow darkens all the day.<br> I know thou sleepest on the hill<br> Of the cock-crowing, but in vain<br> I climb its steep and stony heights,<br> Nor one dim moment shall again<br> On her, who living, I loved best<br> These eyes of mine adoring rest!<br> Homewards I turn, and in our lonely room,<br> Without the alcove, in the silent gloom<br>   My gaze falls on thy pillow!</p>

 <p>Still the fair moon illumes the Autumn night,<br> As when last year we marvelled at its light,<br> But between thee and me, a year's whole space,<br>   That one past year divideth!</p>  <h3 align="center">ON PRINCE NAGA'S GOING A-HUNTING ON THE MOOR OF KARIJI</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Hitómaro</span></p>  
 <p>My Prince, who rules in peaceful power,<br> Child of the Sun-orb shining high,<br> Hath ta’en his horses and his men<br> To where the stag and wild-fowl lie.<br> On wild Kariji's grassy moor,<br> He setteth forth to chase the deer.<br> As the stag boweth—knees to ground,<br> So do I, bowing low, revere;<br> As the quail creepeth through the grass,<br> I tender service to my Lord,<br> Lifting mine eyes as to the sky,<br> Sun-bright and shining as a sword—<br> Eyes like a polished mirror bright,<br> Loyal and true—reflect the light.<br> Is he not brave, my Prince! and fair<br> As the Spring-blossoms, debonair!</p>

 <p>See how the Hunter's Moon, full-orbed,<br>   Crosseth the heavens with shining light;<br> We will draw down the moon with cords,<br>   To form his canopy to-night.</p>  <h3 align="center">ON PRINCE KARU'S RETIREMENT TO THE MOOR OF AKI, TO MEDITATE</h3>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu "—Lay 12)</p>  
 <p align="center">By Hitómaro</p>  
 <p>He, Heaven-descended of the Shining One<br> Who dwells divine, bright Goddess of the Sun!<br> He hath forsaken circumstance and state<br> Of royal cities, and, unhesitate,<br> Hitsusé's hill-encircled wilds reviews,<br> The pathless steeps, the forest ways pursues—<br> When morning dawns, with waking wild-birds’ cry,<br> When in the West the burning sun-fires die,<br> Faring; till on the moor of Aki, white<br> With fallen snow, the grasses tall and slight<br> Of plumed susuki, brusheth he aside,<br> To sleep on the grass-pillow, there to bide.<br> And, far from pageantry and regal state<br> On the past days to muse and meditate!</p>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Hitómaro</span></p>  
 <p>Not yet, O Hill! high hill of Autumn scatter<br> Red leaves and gold athwart the distant view.<br> Let me gaze on, a little instant longer,<br> Where she I love leans toward me through the blue!</p>  <h3 align="center">ON THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE AT KARU</h3>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu "—Lay 27)</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Hitómaro</span></p>  
 <p>By Karu's road, where high the mallard fly,<br> In her own home-place did my love abide,<br> And all my soul with deep desire did sigh<br> To see her and to linger by her side.<br> But prying eyes too constant visits barred,<br> And eyes too many made our meetings few.<br> Yet did I trust—tho’ long the ways and hard,<br> Endless as trailing creepers—yet anew<br> To meet my love. All hopeful did I trust,<br> As to his tall ship trusteth seaman bold,<br> While still our love was hid, as deep pool thrust<br> ’Mid rocks whose hearts hold fire, tho’ outward cold.</p>

 <p>Alas! the sun is darkened in my sky!<br> The moon that lit my heav’n is hid from view.<br> Graceful as sea-fronds that in green deeps lie,<br> My love, like Autumn's pride of leaf and hue,<br> Out of my world has vanished, as the dew!</p>  
 <p>     *        *        *        *        *</p>  
 <p>Such are the tidings that the runner brings,<br> White-wanded messenger whose words I hear—<br> They pierce me, as the arrows from the strings<br> Of white-wood bows—the words that sting and sear!</p>  
 <p>     *        *        *        *        *</p>  
 <p>Nor answer find I, neither comfort gain.<br> Yet, to assuage a thousandth part my woe,<br> Karu-wards wending, full of grief and pain,<br> I listen for her accents sweet and low,<br> Her voice I list for—but alone I hear<br> The wild-fowl screaming as they take their flight<br> Across Unebi, to the shining mere.<br> No form with sleeves uplifted greets my sight—<br> The thronging folk upon the way I meet,<br> Scanning their faces, but I never see<br> A face like hers—and so with weary feet<br> I stumble on in hopeless misery.<br> Onward I wend, and can but cry again<br> The loved one's name, and wave my sleeve in vain!</p>

 <p>Fain would I seek among the winding hill paths,<br> Where ruddy clouds of foliage hide the ways,<br> Her whom I love, who wanders ever further;<br> But all unknown. the pathway where she strays!</p>
