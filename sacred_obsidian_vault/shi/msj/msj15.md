 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><a href="index.htm"><img src="img/tease.jpg"></a><br><i>The Master-Singers of Japan</i>, by Clara A. Walsh, [1914], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">THE RIVERSIDE</h3>  
 <p>The Tatsuta's clear waters redly flow<br> This placid eventide, whereby I know<br> On the high hills the maples flame afar,<br> And down the stream, a floating fiery star,<br> Drifts the red leaf in splendour. Yet alas!<br> To see the glory of the Autumn pass!</p>  <h3 align="center">THE CUT CHRYSANTHEMUM</h3>  
 <p>Who could have cut this fair chrysanthemum,<br> Regardless of its beauty as it grew<br> In nature's harmony of leaf and stem?<br> One who perchance has plucked it ere its prime,<br> Mistakenly, to save it from chill winds,<br> Or lest it perish in the heavy dew.</p>  <h3 align="center">THE FIRST SNOW</h3>  
 <p>In my black hair white threads begin to stray,<br> Gleam in the winter sunlight. Now I gaze<br> On the year's earliest snow with vague dismay<br> Soon shall I see the winter of my days.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">WHY?</h3>  
 <p>It grieves me, on this Life to contemplate,<br> This Life that seems but as a summer cloud<br> In a vast sky—floats up, and drifts away,<br> Knowing no whence nor whither!</p>  <h3 align="center">MIRAGE</h3>  
 <p>I say not that this Life is pitiful,<br> Or that unending woe is mortals’ lot,<br> For Life is but a mirage of the mind,<br> And who can say if it exist or not?</p>  <h3 align="center">ACROSS THE HILLS</h3>  
 <p>Who in the wild hills strays,<br> These late October days,<br>    A gift receives<br> Upon his shoulders laid—<br> A cloak of rich brocade<br> (Yet all unwoven)<br>    Of the maple leaves.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">FALLEN LEAVES</h3>  
 <p>At the tree's foot, with gorgeous colours fraught,<br> The scarlet maple leaves rest as they fell.<br> Where is the Autumn in whose hand was brought<br> That splendid foliage? Rests she here as well<br> Under the mantle she herself has wrought?</p>  <h3 align="center">IN WINTER-TIDE</h3>  
 <p>My garden's fairest scenes, from now will show,<br> Susuki-grass-plumes, graceful bending low,<br> Under their burden of fresh-fallen snow!</p>  <h3 align="center">FLOWERING GRASSES</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Motosuki</span></p>  
 <p>Flowering Susuki's many sleeves invite<br>   In this fair field a lingering stay,<br> But coldly turns the Autumn from their sight,<br>   And leaves the scene to Winter grey.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">REJOICING</h3>  
 <p>Bright gleam the buds a-shine against the blue,<br> While from green woods trills many a joyous voice.<br> All hearts are gladsome: must it not be true,<br> That "when the happy laugh the gods rejoice"?</p>  <h3 align="center">LIGHT OF DHARMAKÂYA</h3>  
 <p>Many the paths that twist and wind<br> Through stream-cleft vale or forest maze;<br> But those who reach the hill-top find<br> (Though they have climbed by different ways)<br> On the wide summit, clear and kind,<br> Just the same moonlight softly plays,<br> Shining on all with equal rays!</p>  <h3 align="center">GHOST DRAGON-FLIES</h3>  
 <p>At the brief home-returning of the dead,<br> Bright is the air with flashing dragon-flies,<br> Like gossamers at sunset shining red;<br> The spirits’ burnished steeds flit through the skies,<br> Each to its bourne, by viewless riders sped!</p>  
 <p><small><i>Note</i>.—During the three days’ festival of the dead—"Bon" (the Spirits of departed ancestors) are believed to be carried by dragonflies to their old homes.</small></p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">A PLAINT</h3>  
 <p>As Autumn closes in, and fitful blows<br> The dreary wind, that passes moaning by,<br> My heart, already sorrow-laden, grows<br> Sadder to hear the wild geese pensive cry—<br> Leave me hereafter to my sad repose,<br> O kindly birds of passage! Come not nigh!</p>  <h3 align="center">BROCADE</h3>  
 <p>Fair goddess of the paling Autumn skies,<br> Fain would I know how many looms she plies,<br> Wherein through skilful tapestry she weaves<br> Her fine brocade of fiery maple leaves—<br> Since on each hill, with every gust that blows,<br> In varied hues her vast embroidery glows?</p>  <h3 align="center">AT JIZŌ'S SHRINE</h3>  
 <p>Fronting the kindly Jizō's shrine<br> The cherry-blooms are blowing now,<br> Pink cloud of flower on slender bough,<br> And hidden tracery of line.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>Rose-dawn against moss-mellowed grey,<br> Through which the wind-tost sprays allow<br> Glimpse of calm smile and placid brow,<br> Of carven face where sunbeams play.</p>  
 <p>Dawn-time, I pluck a branch, and swift<br> Flutters a flight of petals fair;<br> Through the fresh-scented morning air<br> Down to the waving grass they drift.</p>  
 <p>Noon-tide my idle fingers stray,<br> Through the fair maze of bud and flower,<br> Sending a sudden blossom-shower<br> From the sweet fragrance-haunted spray.</p>  
 <p>Low in the west the red fire dies,<br> Vaguely I lift my hand, but now<br> Jizō is not—nor cherry bough—<br> Only the dark of starless skies!</p>  <h3 align="center">THE BLOSSOM-OFFERING</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Hujyō</span></p>  
 <p>If I should pluck this fair flower blossoming,<br> I might defile its beauty with my hand,<br> So let it stay, ungathered where it grows.<br> I offer its unsullied loveliness<br> To Buddhas past, and present, and to come</p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">LATE CHERRY-BLOOM</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Shōni no Myōfu</span></p>  
 <p>Here, sheltered by the hill,<br> Lonely wild cherry still<br>    I find in bloom.<br> Let not the wild wind know!<br>    Or it will surely blow<br> And scatter this last trace<br>    Of passing Spring!</p>  <h3 align="center">TEARS</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Fujiwara Tada-Kuni</span></p>  
 <p>I thought that tears, the gems of Sorrow's crown,<br> Were human only, yet I see each blade<br> Of slender grass with shining drops weighed down,<br> White dewdrop tears, that glimmer in the shade;<br> Even the grass would seem all passion-filled,<br> As my own heart, with grief not to be stilled!</p>  <h3 align="center">PERFUME AND BEAUTY</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kawara no Sadaijin</span></p>  
 <p>I'll gather dewdrops from the cherry-trees,<br> And bathe me in their perfume through and through, <a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a><br> Ere yet there comes the rough and envious breeze<br> To carry off both flowers and fragrance too!</p>
