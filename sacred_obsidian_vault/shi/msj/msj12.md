 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">From Prose Version of Buddhist Wasau by Lafcadio Hearn</span></p>  
 <p>In the pale grey Land of Meido,<br> At the foot of Shidé mountain,<br> From the River of Souls’ dry bed<br>   Rises the murmur of voices,<br>   The prattle of baby-voices,<br>   The accents of early childhood.</p>  
 <p>Not of this world is their sorrow,<br> Not as the crying of children<br> Heard on this earth, but how mournful!<br>   Plaint of their pitiful longing,<br> Yearning for home and for parents.<br> "Father I so longed for—O Father!<br> Mother belovéd, O Mother!<br>   Wail from the River of Souls.</p>  
 <p>Sad is the task they endeavour,<br> Gathering stones from the river,<br>   Heaps for the Towers of Prayer.</p>  
 <p>Building the first Tower, and praying<br> The Gods to shower blessings on Father;<br> Piling the second, imploring<br> The Gods to shower blessings on Mother;<br> Heaping the third Tower, and pleading<br> For Brother and Sister, and dear ones.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></a></p>  
 <p>Such day by day their employment.<br> Piteous, piercing the marrow<br> The tale of their sorrowful task.</p>  
 <p>But when the sunset approaches<br> Then appear demons, demanding<br> "What is this work you are doing?<br> Think you your parents still living<br> Care for your service or offering?<br> Hopeless they weep and bewail you,<br> Mourn for you, morning till evening.</p>  
 <p>Thus all the sorrows you suffer<br> Come from the grief of your parents<br> Resenting the will of the gods!<br> So blame not us, but your parents?"</p>  
 <p>Then the fierce demons demolish<br> The fruits of the little ones’ labour.<br> Hurling the stones with their bludgeons,<br> Deaf to the wailing and tears.</p>  
 <p>Swift to the sorrowing children,<br> Jizō comes softly, "the Teacher,"<br> "Shining King"—beaming in pity,<br> Gently he comes to console them.</p>  
 <p>"Be not afraid, little dear ones,<br> You were so little to come here,<br> All the long journey to Meido!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a></p>  
 <p>I will be Father and Mother,<br> Father and Mother and Playmate<br> To all little children in Meido!"</p>  
 <p>Then he caresses them kindly,<br> Folding his shining robes round them,<br> Lifting the smallest and frailest<br> Into his bosom, and holding<br> His staff for the stumblers to clutch.</p>  
 <p>To his long sleeves cling the infants,<br> Smile, in response to his smiling,<br> Glad in his beauteous compassion.</p>  
 <p>Jizō the Diamond of Pity!<br> Jizō the little ones’ God!</p>  <h3 align="center">CHERRY-BLOSSOM</h3>  
 <p>Through the wild cherry-blooms that snow<br> Yamato's hills with petals fair,<br> The shining morning sun-rays glow:<br> Will you not come and see them there?</p>  <h3 align="center">THE FLOWERS</h3>  
 <p>Outside my dwelling crickets sing,<br> Deep in the grass. And on the lea<br> The clover-bush is blossoming<br> In full perfection.—Come and see!</p>

 <p>Standing, her beauty holds,<br> The peony's white loveliness;<br> Seated, her robe enfolds<br> Charms that surpass in graciousness<br> The Botan <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">*</font></a> in its pride;<br> And when she walks in silk array,<br> Abashed the fragile poppies sway<br> In slender grace outvied.</p>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Ikuju</span></p>  
 <p>Pine -branch at the door<br> On the road to the unknown<br>    A milestone marking,<br> To some a way of gladness,<br> To some a path of sorrow.</p>  <h3 align="center">ONE AND MANY</h3>  
 <p>The current of the stream unceasing flows,<br> But ever-changing are its waters cool.<br> The foam that, lingering, floats upon the pool<br> Now vanishes, now swiftly forms again,<br> And snow-like drifting on the surface shows.</p>
