 <p> <a name="note_3"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_3">3</a>. In ancient Japanese mythology, the name of the Moon-God is Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto or His-Augustness-Moon-Night-Possessor (or Moon-Night-Darkness), <i>i.e.</i>, the God of the Night-Dominion.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_4"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_4">4</a>. Correctly expressed, Takehaya-Susano-O-no-Mikoto or His-Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness is surely the deification of the rainstorm, although we admit that there are also some traces of an historical human being in him.</p>

 <p> “When Heaven and Earth separated, the God named Ame-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami, who was born in the midst of Heaven, had three sons of whom the eldest, Takami-Musubi-no-Kami, <i>i.e.</i>, Sumeragamutsu-Kamurogi-no-Mikoto, is the ancestor of the Tomo and Saeki families; the second son, Tsuhaya-Musubi-no-Kami, <i>i.e.</i>, Sumeragamutsu-Kamuromi-no-Mikoto, is the ancestor of the Nakatomi family of Asomi rank; and the youngest one, Kamumi-Musubi-no-Kami, is the ancestor of the Ki family of Atae rank.”</p>
 
 <p> In the divine genealogy of the <i>Sendai-Kuji-Hongi</i>, Tsuhaya-Musubi-no-Mikoto (the word “Mikoto” is used indifferently with “Kami”) has a son, called Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto, who is the ancestor of the Nakatomi family of Muraji rank (<i>I.e.</i>, the seventh of the eight classes of nobility created by the Emperor Temmu in <small>A.D.</small> 684, and given to the heads of certain corporations. <i>Vide</i> the <i>Sendai-Kuji-Hongi</i>.

 <i>on the Catalogue of Family Names Newly Compiled by Prince Manta</i> (Japanese edition, vol. <small>XI</small>, p. 791).</p>
 
 <p> The Tamatsukuri or Jewel-making family is a sub-division of the Imbe family resident in Izumo Province.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_13"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_13">13</a>. In ancient Japan, a rare jewel being regarded as a divine object, possessed a magical influence, and was a kind of fetish; so, for the simple-minded Japanese of old, it was possible that through the magical virtue of the jewels a child was born.</p>
 
 <p> In the <i>Sendai-Kuji-Hongi</i>, the Japanese reader is very familiar with a certain jewel of magical virtue, called “Makaru-Kaeshi-no-Tama,” <i>i.e.</i>, the “Jewel endowed with a miraculous power of restoring the dead to life” (<i>Vide</i> the <i>Kokushi-Taikei</i>, Japanese edition, vol. <small>VII</small>, pp. 321, 322).</p>
 
 <p> The <i>Nihongi</i> also mentions two notable magical gems, which Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto used as amulets, talismans or charms, in time of peril. They are known as the Shiomitsu-Ni and Shiohiru-Ni, <i>i.e.</i>, the Tide-flowing and Tide-ebbing Jewels (<i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 94).</p>
 
 <p> The <i>Kojiki</i> mentions a divinized jewel, which being the necklace of the God Izanagi was actually regarded as a divinity called Mikuratana-no-Kami (B. H. Chamberlain, <i>E.T.K.</i>, p. 43).</p>
 
 <p> From the <i>Kojiki</i> we learn that the divine emblem of the Himekoso Shrine is a crimson jewel (B. H. Chamberlain, <i>E.T.K.</i>, p. 258).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_14"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_14">14</a>. Akatsu-no-Mikoto is an abbreviation of Masaka-Akatsu-Kachihayahi-Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto,
 
 <!------------------------page 61------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a>
 
 usually abbreviated as Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto (B. H. Chamberlain, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 48, 93).</p>
 
 <p> As regards the expression “wakigo” in connection with this, <i>vide</i> K. A. Florenz’s German translation of the <i>Kogoshūi</i> (<i>Die Historischen Quellen der Shintō-Religion</i>, S. 448) and Nasa-Katsutaka’s <i>Giosai</i>. Imbe-no-Hironari’s etymological explanation of the words “wakigo” and “wakago” is hardly credible.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_15"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_15">15</a>. This passage will bear three constructions; <i>viz.</i>, the first being that of the author of the <i>Kogoshūi</i>: Susano-O’s “Setting up rods at the rice-fields” may indicate that he claimed the possession of the rice-fields. Sometimes he used dividing ropes, in place of rods, as signs of ownership. Secondly, as Aston thinks, “Setting up combs at the rice-fields” might be interpreted as having a magical meaning, but this explanation is not quite satisfactory (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 48). And thirdly, we ourselves rather agree with Dr. K. A. Florenz who interpreted the action of erecting rods in the deep mud of the rice-fields to be simply a mischievous design to injure the barefooted Japanese peasantry labouring in the paddy fields (K. A. Florenz, English translation of the <i>Ōharai-no-Norito</i>. <i>T.A.S.J.</i>, vol. <small>XXVII</small>, pp. 80, 81).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_16"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_16">16</a>. The author of the <i>Kogoshūi</i>, misled by the Chinese character “he” (戶) which literally means “door,” gave the above-quoted interpretation, but the true meaning of the word
 
 <!------------------------page 62------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a>
 
 “kusohe” is simply “to discharge excreta,” and in the present instance, as regards both the <i>Kojiki</i> and <i>Nihongi</i> accounts, it can be readily seen that the rude Susano-O-no-Kami’s bad intention was to pollute his divine sister’s Sacred Hall before the Autumnal Harvest Festival, by evacuating his excreta in that building</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_17"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_17">17</a>. “Ame-no-Yasu-no-Kawara” in Japanese. Aston translates as “The Bank of the Tranquil River of Heaven,” but he seems to have been misled by the Chinese characters used in the <i>Nihongi</i>, and so to have rendered them too literally. The true meaning seems to be that which we have rendered into English in the present text.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_18"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_18">18</a>. According to the <i>Ōtonohogai-no-Norito</i> or <i>Ritual of the Luck-wishing of the Great-Palace</i> (<i>Ritual for Bringing Good Fortune to the Great Palace</i>), not “measures of varying size,” but “consecrated axes, large and small,” may seem to be meant. <i>Vide</i> Sir E. Satow, <i>Ancient Japanese Rituals</i>, part <small>III</small>, No. 8 (<i>T.A.S.J.</i>).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_19"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_19">19</a>. According to the <i>Nihongi</i> (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 43), the Yasakani, or Yasaka Jewels, <i>i.e.</i>, the Ever-bright Curved Jewels.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_20"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_20">20</a>. The identity of this tree is uncertain. Some Japanese commentators say that the word “oke” was probably inserted here by mistake.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_21"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_21">21</a>. With regard to the parallel passages in the <i>Kojiki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i>, “ukefuse” signifies “to put a tub bottom upwards,”
 
 <!------------------------page 63------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a>
 
 and in this instance Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto performed a divine dance on the tub, stamping until it resounded like a drum, and thereby coming into union with the Divine, <i>i.e.</i>, as though she were herself possessed by the divine spirit. The original expression “ukefuse” never conveys the idea of an oath, which the author of the <i>Kogoshūi</i> erroneously accepted.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_22"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_22">22</a>. “Shimenawa” is the ordinary form of the rather archaic “shirikumenawa.” According to B. H. Chamberlain, in perfect agreement with the learned Moto-Ori, “shirikumenawa” denotes straw rope so constructed that the roots of the straw project and are visible at the end of the rope. Moto-Ori’s explanation shows that this is more likely to be the proper significance of the word than “back-limiting-rope” (“shirihe-kagiri-me-nawa”) which, as Kamo-Mabuchi had previously suggested, might have originated when the event narrated in the legend was described (B. H. Chamberlain, <i>E.T.K.</i>, p. 59). According to our view, “shime” may mean “to forbid,” just as “shimeno” denotes a “forbidden field,” so that the land encircled by a rope is simply taboo, <i>i.e.</i>, a sacred precinct forbidden to be approached or trodden upon by ordinary unclean feet. Since the entrance to the Rock-Cave was barred by a similar rope, this “shimeno” was probably a tabooed forbidden ground or sanctuary, which laymen must not enter. We cannot understand the explanation given in a note in the <i>Kogoshūi</i> that this rope represents “the sun’s shadow.”</p>

 <p> <a name="note_23"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_23">23</a>. <i>I.e.</i>, the Goddess of the Great August Palace. Sir Ernest Satow considers that this Goddess is simply a “Personification of the successive generations of the Mikado’s consorts” (<i>T.A.S.J.</i>, vol. <small>VII</small>, p. 122). <i>Vide</i> note <a href="#note_56">56</a>.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_24"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_24">24</a>. Literally, “tayo” means “abundant, strong or powerful,” and “iwa” “rock,” but in this case its true meaning is “strong, enduring, eternal,” and “mado” is a “window,” or “gate.” So Toyo-Iwamado-no-Mikoto signifies “the Powerful God of the Strong Gate.”</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_25"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_25">25</a>. Kushi-Iwamado-no-Mikoto means “the Wonderful God of the Strong Gate.”</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_26"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_26">26</a>. The culture hero Ōnamuchi-no-Kami is better known as Ōkuninushi-no-Kami, who first ruled over Izumo Province, as a local god.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_27"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_27">27</a>. Nowadays it is very difficult to ascertain the location of the Tokoyo-no-Kuni, for it is referred to in different ways by the <i>Kojiki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i>. In our opinion, the word Tokoyo-no-Kuni possibly had three different meanings: the first, literally speaking, being the “Eternal Land,” or the “Land of Eternal Bliss,” or “Paradise”; the second, the “Land of Eternal Night-Darkness” or “Underworld”; and the third, a most distant country, although it exists somewhere on the earth, very far away from Japan.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_28"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_28">28</a>. According to the <i>Nihongi</i>, this Edict was issued by Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 77).</p>
 
 <p>
 
 <!------------------------page 65------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a>
 
 </p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_29"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_29">29</a>. Both the <i>Kojiki</i> and <i>Nihongi</i> accounts of this tradition mention three Sacred Treasures, namely, the Jewels, the Mirror, and the Sword, which have been handed down in the Imperial family as the Divine Heirlooms, without whose possession no Emperor can legitimately ascend the Throne of Japan. However, the <i>Ōtonohogai</i>—a Shintō Ritual in the <i>Engishiki</i> (10th century <small>A.D.</small>)—mentions only the Sacred Mirror and the Divine Sword, in this agreeing with the <i>Jingiryō</i> or <i>Shintō Administrative Law</i> in the 8th century <small>A.D.</small> Clearly, therefore, Imbe-no-Hironari mentioned this fact, as it is stated in the <i>Jingiryō</i> and in the <i>Ōtonohogai</i>, but the oldest traditions clearly include the Jewels in the Divine Imperial Heirloom, and that there are three is the universally held belief as witnessed by the expression “Sanshu-no-Shinki” (Three Kinds of Divine Insignia). In the <i>Nihongi</i> it is not two deities (Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami and Takami-Musubi-no-Kami), but only one deity (Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami) that confers the Divine Imperial Heirloom upon the Heavenly Grandson (<i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 76).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_30"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_30">30</a>. In one account the <i>Nihongi</i> ascribes this Edict to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone, and he who receives her command is not the Heavenly Grandson but her son Ame-no-Oshihomimi-no-Mikoto. <i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 83.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_31"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_31">31</a>. In both the <i>Kojiki</i> and <i>Nihongi</i> accounts, five instead of three heavenly attendants, called the “Gods of the Five Hereditary Corporations”, are mentioned—the two additional divinities being Ishikoritome-no-Mikoto and Tamanoya-no-Mikoto.</p>

 </p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_32"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_32">32</a>. The <i>Nihongi</i> ascribes the first half (“We.....welfare of the Heavenly Grandson”) of this Edict to Takami-Musubi-no-Kami alone. <i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, pp. 81, 82.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_33"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_33">33</a>. In the <i>Nihongi</i>, the words of this Edict, “Guarding him in your attendance under the same roof against all emergencies,” are ascribed to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 83).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_34"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_34">34</a>. The passage, “Serving him with the rice of the consecrated above,” is ascribed to Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami alone in the <i>Nihongi</i> account. <i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 83.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_35"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_35">35</a>. Certain commentators on the <i>Kujiki</i> (<i>Chronicles of the Old Matters of Former Ages</i>) explain that “those Gods” are the Thirty-Two Gods, mentioned in the <i>Kujiki</i>, who, besides the “Gods of the Five Hereditary Corporations,” accompanied the Heavenly Grandson towards the earth.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_36"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_36">36</a>. The <i>Nihongi</i> ascribes the Edict to Takami-Musubi-no-Kami alone. <i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>,. p. 81.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_37"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_37">37</a>. <i>I.e.</i>, Chimata-no-Kami.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_38"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_38">38</a>. Later, Saruta-Hiko, Ame-no-Uzume, Chimata-no-Kami (or the God Yachimata-Hiko and the Goddess Yachimata-Hime), Sae-no-Kami, Dōsojin, and Funado-no-Kami constitute a class of Japanese phallic gods (as well as guardian gods of travellers and
 
 <!------------------------page 67------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a>
 
 divine warders against epidemic diseases), and curiously enough Saruta-Hiko, an ancient phallic god, is represented as a moral teacher in the writings of certain authors (<i>e.g.</i>, Yamazaki-Ansai) during the Tokugawa Régime.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_39"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_39">39</a>. <i>Cf.</i> B. H. Chamberlain, <i>E.T.K.</i>, p. 110, note 33 and p. 113, note 2.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_40"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_40">40</a>. According to the compilers of the <i>Nihongi</i>, this is Hiko-nagisatake-Ugaya-Fuki-Aezu-no-Mikoto, who is no other than the father of Japan’s first human Emperor, Jimmu-Tennō, whose enthronement ceremony took place, according to tradition, in 660 B.C.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_41"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_41">41</a>. Most modern scholars, whether native or foreign, are of opinion that the reign of that Emperor really began some hundreds of years later.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_42"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_42">42</a>. The Emperor Jimmu started on an expedition for the so-called “Eastern Conquest” from Kyūshū, the western districts of Japan, to Yamato in the east, so the “eastern provinces” here referred to denotes the Yamato districts.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_43"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_43">43</a>. By this Nagasune-Hiko is meant. He was one of the most stubborn opponents of the Emperor Jimmu and was killed by Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto, according to the <i>Nihongi</i> account (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 128).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_44"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_44">44</a>. According to the <i>Nihongi</i>, this man met the Emperor Jimmu at the port of Hayasui in Bungo Province and was employed in the service of the Imperial army whilst <i>en route</i> to Usa in Buzen Province, and afterwards he was ordered to ascend Mt. Kagu in

 Yamato in disguise and there obtain a small lump of earth which it was indispensable to use when invoking the gods for victory. He succeeded in bringing it back safely to the Imperial camp despite the vigilance of his foes (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 112).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_45"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_45">45</a>. <i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 116.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_46"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_46">46</a>. In archaic Japanese “mi-araka” means “august or divine abode,” <i>i.e.</i>, “Imperial Palace.”</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_47"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_47">47</a>. Here the Sovereign Grandson means the Emperor Jimmu.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_48"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_48">48</a>. “Miki” means “august wood,” <i>i.e.</i>, “sacred timbers.”</p>

In the Shintō Ritual of <i>Ōtonohogai</i> (<i>Luck-wishing or Blessing of the Great Palace</i>) or <i>Shintō Prayer to the Guardian Gods of the Imperial Palace</i> the favour of the same Goddess is invoked for the protection of the Imperial Palace from every ill. Hirata identified this Goddess with Ame-no-Uzume or Miyabi-no-Kami (Hirata-Atsutane, The <i>Miyami-no-Kami-Godenki</i>.

So to the end Kotoshironushi-no-Kami remained exceedingly faithful to the Imperial cause, and therefore according to some Japanese commentators he was afterwards looked up to as one of the guardian spirits of the Imperial House.</p>

The <i>Collected Works</i>, Japanese edition, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 877) to indicate one and the same God, Ame-no-Iwatowake-no-Kami. Both Gods are divine guardians of the Imperial Gates, according to one of the Shintō Rituals of the <i>Engishiki</i> or <i>Institutes of the Engi Period</i> (<small>A.D.</small> 901-923). As regards the eight deities enshrined at the Jingikan, <i>i.e.</i>, the Department for the Worship of the Shintō Gods, Sir Ernest Satow’s learned comments deserve our attention (<i>Vide</i> <i>T.A.S.J.</i>, vol. <small>VII</small>, p. 109 and pp. 120-123).</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_61"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_61">61</a>. What the “God of Ikushima” really means is not very clear, but it appears to be the chief local guardian spirit by whose virtue the locality or country (region or island) exists.</p>

 <!------------------------page 71------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a>
 
 “Igashiri” which means “dwelling place,” hence the word “Ikasuri” in the text means the grounds of the Imperial Court, and the author of the <i>Kogoshūi</i> probably understood by it the special guardian spirits of the Imperial Court-Grounds.</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_64"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_64">64</a>. The sword here referred to is the Murakumo Sword, which Susano-O-no-Mikoto found in the tail of the monster serpent when he slew it in Izumo; and the Yata-no-Kagami or Eight-hand-span or Large Mirror is believed to be the same mirror which Ishikoritome-no-Mikoto constructed and with which he induced the Sun-Goddess Amaterasu-Ō-Mikami to quit her retreat in the Rock-Cave and restore blessings to mankind by illuminating the heavens and the earth with the radiance of her bounteous light.</p>

 <p> <a name="note_74"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_74">74</a>. The meaning of this song is not quite clear. Even the Japanese commentators find difficulties in apprehending it, and differ in their explanations. The song may mean:—</p>
 
 <p> “What a delightfully happy evening this grand banquet gives us courtiers, who at the Ceremony of the Removing of the Divine Insignia greatly enjoy ourselves throughout the whole night! O how auspicious is the snow scene this night!”</p>
 
 <p> Or, the song may be read as follows:—</p>
 
 <p> “We courtiers present at the Ceremony of the Removal of the Divine Insignia now enjoy great pleasure at the grand banquet throughout the whole night in the fine sacred Yuki Hall!”</p>
 
 <p> As we see above, some commentators understand “snow” by the word “yuki,” whilst others interpret it as the name of a Shintō Worship Hall (or Pavilion), “Yuki” (or “Yuki-Den”), which is newly built for the Shintō Rites held at each Emperor’s Enthronement.</p>
 
 <p> Taking into consideration what Ban-Nobutomo suggests in his autographic annotations to the <i>Kogoshūi</i> and in reference to certain passages in the <i>Nihon-Sandai-Jitsuroku</i> describing the scenes of the Daijō Feast at the Enthronement Ceremony of the Emperor Kōkō on the 23rd and 25th days of the 11th month in

 the 8th year (<small>A.D.</small> 884) of Gengyō (<i>Vide</i> the <i>Nihon-Sandai-Jitsuroku</i>, vol. <small>XLVI</small>. The <i>Kokushi-Taikei</i>, Japanese edition, vol. <small>IV</small>, p. 648), we may interpret the obscure meaning of the song as follows:</p>
 
 <p> “Let us courtiers make merry the whole night through! Oh, how fine for us courtiers is the sacred ‘sake’ drink!”</p>
 
 <p> “What a fine long robe each courtier wears at the Ceremony of Removing the Divine Insignia; it reaches below the knees!”</p>
 
 <p> <a name="note_75"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_75">75</a>. According to Tachibana-no-Moribe, one of the ablest scholars of the Tokugawa Régime, it reads as follows:—</p>
 
 <p> “The courtiers’ fine long robes, reaching below the knees; how magnificent they look!”</p>
 
 <p> (<i>Vide</i> Tachibana-no-Moribe, The <i>Kagura-Uta-Iriaya</i>. The <i>Moribe-Zenshū</i> or <i>Collected Works</i>, Japanese edition, vol. <small>VII</small>, p. 57).</p>
 
 <p> Another interpretation advanced by Ikebe-no-Mahari for the first song in question is this:</p>
 
 <p> “We courtiers have enjoyed ourselves greatly until late at night, singing, dancing, and gently striking the knees with our hands. O how happy and pleasant it is to-night at the Ceremony of Removing the Divine Insignia!”</p>
 
 <p> The same author renders the meaning of the second song as follows:</p>
 
 <p> “What a fine, long robe each courtier in the suite wears at the Ceremony of the Removing of the Divine Insignia! It reaches to the knees. Oh, how splendid is the procession to the Divine

 <p> Two other similar songs of the same sort, according to the <i>Kōtaijingū-Gishikichō</i>, were sung at the Ise Shrine of the Sun-Goddess, on the occasion of the Sacred Feast. These songs are:</p>
 
 <p> “The courtiers are enjoying themselves very much striking their knees gently, the sound re-echoes through the Sacred Hall!”</p>
 
 <p> “At the joyous divine feast in the Sacred Hall at Isuzu, the sound of the courtiers’ striking their knees echoes and re-echoes all over the Hall!”</p>

 <p> The author of the <i>Kogoshūi</i> took the Abstinence Palace to be the abode of the Guardian Priestess Yamato-Hime-no-Mikoto, but this is incorrect. That the palace or shrine was for the Sun-Goddess herself is proved by the description given in the <i>Nihongi</i>.</p>
 
 <p> “In compliance, therefore, with the instruction of the Great Goddess, a shrine was erected to her in the province of Ise. Accordingly, an Abstinence Palace was built beside the River Isuzu” (<i>Vide</i> W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, pp. 41, 176).</p>

 <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a>
 
 monster serpent or Japanese Python, whose tail contained it, but tradition has it that wherever the Sword might be, there also was a mass of clouds. Moreover, according to the <i>Nihongi</i> tradition (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 205), it was by its miraculous power that Prince Yamatotakeru himself narrowly escaped being burnt to death by his treacherous enemy in the field of Yaitsu in Suruga Province. It is surely a divine object whose supernatural presence protected the Hero-Prince from personal danger, and the primitive natives regarded it as divine, although modern critics assert that it was some kind of talisman or fetish. Wherever that Sword was, the Prince was safe (as the <i>Kogoshūi</i> relates), whilst through its absence he was finally led to ruin, when climbing Mt. Ibuki. In old Japan the sword was considered to be endowed with supernatural, miraculous powers. The same is true of the Kusanagi Sword. Compare the chapter “On the Sword” in the <i>Heike-Monogatari</i>, where the miraculous virtues of the sword are specifically described (A. L. Sadler’s English translation of the <i>Heike-Monogatari</i>, the <i>Book of Swords</i>, <i>T.A.S.J.</i>, vol. <small>XLIX</small>, p. 325).</p>

They played a prominent part among the divine guardians who accompanied the expeditionary army to Korea which the Empress Jingō commanded, and, on its return to Japan in triumph, a shrine was erected at Suminoe in Settsu Province in honour of these Gods. Cf. W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 226. B. H. Chamberlain, <i>E.T.K.</i>, pp. 231, 233.</p>

 <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a>
 
 Ichishi at Iware, a cherry blossom flowering out of season in winter fell into the Emporor’s cup of “sake,” and this incident particularly attracting the Emperor’s attention, His Majesty was pleased to name his palace after it, and the author of the <i>Kogoshūi</i> called it “Nochi-no-Iware-Wakasakura-no-Miya” or “Later Iware-Wakasakura Palace” in contradistinction to the palace of the same name at Iware where the Empress Jingō had dwelt. Aston throws doubt on the origin of the name, pointing out that Jingō’s palace had already borne the same title. The present commentators however are of different opinion and consider that there is no doubt that the Emperor Richū dwelt in the Wakasakura Palace and that it owed its name to the pretty story of the <i>Nihongi</i> mentioned above. In support of their opinion, they would point out that the name of the Empress Jingō’s palace is mentioned only in a note in the <i>Nihongi</i> (The <i>Kokushi-Taikei</i>, Japanese edition, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 170), and that it is not as is customary given in the main text describing the chief events at the beginning of her reign. It should be mentioned moreover that the copy of <i>Nihongi</i> made during the Eikyō Era (15th century) omits this note entirely (Iida-Takesato, The <i>Nihonshoki-Tsūshaku</i>, Japanese edition, vol. <small>XXXVI</small>, p. 1955). It is true the text mentions that, in the 69th year of her reign the Empress Jingō died in the Wakasakura Palace, but it must be remembered that the <i>Nihongi</i> was not compiled till the 4th year of Yōrō (<small>A.D.</small> 720) in the Empress Genshō’s reign, and the name Wakasakura becomes prominent for the

 Bunkō (Wen-Kung +628 <small>B.C.</small>), otherwise known as Chōji (Chung-Erh), who later on became Feudal Lord of Shin (Chin) in China. Because Kenkō (Hsien-Kung +651 B.C.), father of Bunkō, under the evil influence of his favorite concubine Riki (Li-Chi), killed his eldest son Shinsei (Shen-Sheng), his heir apparent, Chōji, his second son, ran away to foreign lands. During his wanderings in various countries, Chōji had a most faithful companion, named Kai-Shi-Sui. When the fugitive heir, impoverished and forlorn, was overtaken by hunger and fatigue, this loyal retainer Kai-Shi-Sui was willing to serve him, with flesh torn off his own thighs. Some five years after Kenkō’s death, Chōji returned to his native country and restored peace and order there, after which he became Lord of Shin, when his retainers who accompanied him during his wanderings, were all duly rewarded, except Kai-Shi-Sui.</p>
 
 <p> Kai-Shi-Sui, greatly incensed by the injustice of his master Chōji’s unfair rewards, retired to the Menjō mountain (Meen-Shang-Shan) as a recluse, and abandoned the world. Then the repentant Chōji never failed to send his servants to the mountain to seek for Kai-Shi-Sui, but in vain, for, sad to say, Kai-Shi-Sui had been burnt to death, since in their eagerness to find him, some thoughtless persons set fire to the forest of the mountain, hoping thus to force Kai-Shi-Sui to quit it in response to his former master’s invitation. <i>Vide</i> the <i>Shiki</i> (Shih-Chi).

Florenz, understand by the Chinese characters 聖皇 the Emperor Shun (舜, Shun) of Ancient China. They see therefore in the passage ### a description of the religious ceremonies performed by him when he ascended the Throne in succession to the famous Emperor Gyō (堯, Yao). They base their opinion simply on the ground of the passage being identical with that in the Chinese classical book <i>Shokyō</i> or <i>Shu-Ching</i> (書經) [<i>Shun-Ten</i> or <i>Shun-Tien</i> (蕣典)]. In our opinion, however, Imbe-no-Hironari, the Japanese scholar, made use of the passage cited above merely, because of its rhetorical value in describing a similar event at the Enthronement Ceremony of his own Emperor. The present translators are inclined to support this latter view agreeing with some native commentators (Kubo, The <i>Kogoshūi-Kōgi</i>, Japanese edition, p. 115. Prof. K. A.

G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>II</small>, p. 345, note 3) or a Japanese meadow bunting (<i>emberiza ciopsis</i>), the other, a diviner by means of rice-grains and a domestic cooking-furnace ring. Some commentators surmise that “katakannagi” is a diviner who takes charge of the divination for an ordinary dry field, while “hijikannagi” is a diviner for a wet rice-field, so entrusted with the work of divination for it (<i>Cf.</i> Ban-Nobutomo, The <i>Seibokukō</i> or <i>Enquiries into Genuine Divination</i>.

Another Brahman priest advised that a great temple be erected at the cross-roads in the capital to propitiate these gods, or demons. A third advised a still more efficacious remedy, <i>viz.</i>, to worship the gods or demons by offering several hundreds of white-coloured animals

 <p> “During the 5th and 6th months every year, when the climate is very unhealthy, the people offer white wild boars, white oxen, and white sheep in sacrifice outside the western gate of the citadel, believing that if they did not do so the harvest of ‘five cereals’ would be bad, their ‘six domestic animals’ die, and the people suffer from pestilence” (The <i>Sui-Shu</i>, Chinese edition, vol. <small>LXXXII</small>, <i>vide</i> the <i>Chên-La</i>).</p>

 <p> <a name="note_149"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_149">149</a>. We find the myth of Pan-Ku in a certain Chinese book, entitled <i>Teiō-Goun-Rekinenki</i> (<i>Ti-Wang-Wu-Yun-Li-Nien-Chi</i>). <i>Cf.</i> Nimbō, The <i>Jutsu-I-Ki</i> (Jen-Fang, The Shu-I-Chi).</p>
 
 <p> We venture to use Aston’s quotation from Mayer’s <i>Chinese Manual</i> (p. 174), which says, “Pan-Ku came into being in the Great Waste. His origin is unknown. When dying, he gave birth to the existing material universe. His breath was transmuted

 into the wind and clouds; his voice into thunder; his left eye into the sun, his right eye into the moon; his four limbs and five extremities into the four quarters of the globe and the five great mountains, his blood into the rivers; his muscles and veins into the strata of the earth, his flesh into the soil, etc.” (W. G. Aston, <i>E.T.N.</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 28). A similar idea is also found in the <i>Ṛg Veda</i> (x, 9) which, like the Chinese myth of Pan-Ku, says that the moon came from the God Brahmā’s mind, the sun from his eye, the great Gods, Indra and Agni, from his mouth; whilst the Wind-God Vāyū came from his breath, and the earth and sky were formed from his feet and head.</p>
 
 <p> Another Buddhist Sūtra similarly described the Brahmanistic God Maheśvara:</p>
 
 <p> “The God Maheśvara,—the ethereal heaven is his head, the earth is his body, the water is his urine, the mountains are his excrements, all the living beings are worms in his belly, the wind is his vital breath, the air his bodily heat, both good and evil are the Karma or constituents of his character” (The <i>Gedō-Shōjō-Nehan-Ron</i>. Nanjiō’s <i>Catalogue</i>, No. 1260).</p>

 <p> <a name="note_154"></a><a href="kgsh4.htm#fr_154">154</a>. In certain editions we find the dates differently mentioned, e.g., “the 12th month in the 3rd year of Daidō” or “the 2nd month in the 3rd year of Daidō,” or “the 12th month in the 2nd year of Daidō,” instead of “the 2nd month in the 2nd year of Daidō,” an attempt to synchronize with the date when Imbe-no-Hironari had already been promoted to the Lower Grade of the Junior Fifth Court Rank (he was actually promoted to the Lower Grade of that rank on the 17th day of the 11th month in the 3rd year of Daidō), as mentioned at the beginning of the popular edition of the <i>Kogoshūi</i>, which enjoys a large circulation.</p>
 
 <p> This is no doubt an addition by some scribe at a later date than the time the original manuscript was written by Imbe-no-Hironari himself. In the Hōryūji or Ryakunin manuscript we find no date mentioned at all at the end of it. And one of the Maeda manuscripts mentions that there is a sort of manuscript with no such date at all.</p>
