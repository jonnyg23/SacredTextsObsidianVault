 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>We who on shallow hills <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a> have built our home<br>
 In the heart's deep recess seek solitude.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Turning to the audience</i>.)</p>
 <p>I am a priest of the Kōyasan. I am minded to go up to the Capital to visit the shrines and sanctuaries there.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The Buddha of the Past is gone,<br>
 And he that shall be Buddha has not yet come into the world.</p></dir>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>SECOND PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>In a dream-lull our lives are passed; all, all<br>
 That round us lies<br>
 Is visionary, void.<br>
 Yet got we by rare fortune at our birth<br>
 Man's shape, that is hard to get;<br>
 And dearer gift was given us, harder to win,<br>
 The doctrine of Buddha, seed of our Salvation.<br>
 And me this only thought possessed,<br>
 How I might bring that seed to blossom, till at last<br>
 I drew this sombre cassock across my back.<br>
 And knowing now the lives before my birth,<br>
 No love I owe<br>
 To those that to this life engendered me,<br>
 Nor seek a care (have I not disavowed<br>
 Such hollow bonds?) from child by me begot.<br>
 A thousand leagues<br>
 Is little road <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a><br>
 To the pilgrim's feet.<br>
 The fields his bed,<br>
 The hills his home<br>
 Till the travel's close.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>We have come so fast that we have reached the pine-woods of Abeno, in the country of Tsu. Let us rest in this place.</p></dir>

 <p>KOMACHI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Like a root-cut reed, <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Should the tide entice,<br>
 I would come, I think; but now<br>
 No wave asks; no stream stirs.<br>
 Long ago I was full of pride;<br>
 Crowned with nodding tresses, halcyon locks,<br>
 I walked like a young willow delicately wafted<br>
 By the winds of Spring.<br>
 I spoke with the voice of a nightingale that has sipped the dew.<br>
 I was lovelier than the petals of the wild-rose open-stretched<br>
 In the hour before its fall.<br>
 But now I am grown loathsome even to sluts,<br>
 Poor girls of the people, and they and all men<br>
 Turn scornful from me.<br>
 Unhappy months and days pile up their score;<br>
 I am old; old by a hundred years.<br>
 In the City I fear men's eyes,<br>
 And at dusk, lest they should cry "Is it she?"<br>
 Westward with the moon I creep<br>
 From the cloud-high City of the Hundred Towers.<br>
 No guard will question, none challenge<br>
 Pilgrim so wretched: yet must I he walking<br>
 Hid ever in shadow of the trees.<br>
 Past the Lovers' Tomb,<br>
 And the Hill of Autumn<br>
 To the River of Katsura, the boats, the moonlight.</p></dir>

 <p>Who are those rowing in the boats? <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>

 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Come! The sun is sinking; we must hasten on our way. Look, look at that beggar there! It is a holy Stūpa that she is sitting on! I must tell her to come off it.</p>
 <p>Now then, what is that you are sitting on? Is it not a holy Stūpa, the worshipful Body of Buddha? Come off it and rest in some other place.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KOMACHI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Buddha's worshipful body, you say? But I could see no writing on it, nor any figure carved. I thought it was only a tree-stump.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Even the little black tree on the hillside<br>
 When it has put its blossoms on<br>
 Cannot be hid;<br>
 And think you that this tree<br>
 Cut fivefold in the fashion of Buddha's holy form<br>
 Shall not make manifest its power?</p></dir>

 <p>I too am a poor withered bough.<br>
 But there are flowers at my heart, <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 Good enough, maybe, for an offering.<br>
 But why is this called Buddha's body?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>PRIEST.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Hear then! This Stūpa is the Body of the Diamond Lord. <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">3</font></a> It is the symbol of his incarnation.</p></dir>

 Is no distinction, but a seeming of difference planned<br>

 So she spoke, eagerly; and the priests,<br>
 "A saint, a saint is this decrepit, outcast soul."<br>
 And bending their heads to the ground,<br>
 Three times did homage before her.</p></dir>

 <p>Oh piteous, piteous! Is this<br>
 Komachi that once<br>
 Was a bright flower,<br>

 Linked like young moons;<br>

 Whose many, many damask robes<br>
 Filled cedar-scented halls?</p></dir>

 <p>The cup she held at the feast<br>
 Like gentle moonlight dropped its glint on her sleeve.<br>
 Oh how fell she from splendour,<br>
 How came the white of winter<br>
 To crown her head?<br>
 Where are gone the lovely locks, double-twined,<br>
 The coils of jet?<br>
 Lank wisps, scant curls wither now<br>
 On wilted flesh;<br>
 And twin-arches, moth-brows tinge no more<br>
 With the hue of far hills. "Oh cover, cover<br>
 From the creeping light of dawn<br>
 Silted seaweed locks that of a hundred years<br>
 Lack now but one.<br>
 Oh hide me from my shame."</p></dir>

 Thick as raindrops out of a black summer sky.<br>
