 <p>HOSTESS</p>
 <p>I who now stand before you am a woman of the village of Kantan in China. A long while ago I gave lodging to one who practised the arts of wizardry; and as payment be left here a famous pillow, called the Pillow of Kantan. He who sleeps on this pillow sees in a moment's dream the past or future spread out before him, and so awakes illumined. If it should chance that any worshipful travellers arrive today, pray send for me.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>She takes the pillow and lays it on the covered "daïs" which represents at first the bed and afterwards the palace</i>.)</p>
 <p>ROSEI (<i>enters</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Lost on the journey of life, shall I learn at last<br>
 That I trod but a path of dreams?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>My name is Rosei, and I have come from the land of Shoku. Though born to man's estate, I have not sought Buddha's way, but have drifted from dusk to dawn and dawn to dusk.</p>
 <p>They tell me that on the Hill of the Flying Sheep in the land of So <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">1</font></a> there lives a mighty sage; and now I am hastening to visit him that he may tell by what rule I should conduct my life.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Song of Travel</i>.)</p>
 <p>
 </p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Deep hid behind the alleys of the sky<br>
 Lie the far lands where I was wont to dwell.<br>
 Over the hills I trail<br>
 A tattered cloak; over the hills again:<br>
 Fen-dusk and mountain-dusk and village-dusk <a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a><br>
 Closed many times about me, till to-day<br>
 At the village of Kantan,<br>
 Strange to me save in name, my journey ends.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I have travelled so fast that I am already come to the village of Kantan. Though the sun is still high, I will lodge here to-night. (<i>Knocking</i>.) May I come in?</p>
 <p>HOSTESS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Who is it?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am a traveller; pray give me lodging for the night.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HOSTESS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yes, I can give you lodging; pray come this way. You seem to be travelling all alone. Tell me where you have come from and where you are going.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>1 come from the land of Shoku. They tell me that on the Hill of the Flying Sheep there lives a sage; and I am visiting him that he may tell me by what rule I should conduct my life.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HOSTESS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>It is along way to the Hill of the Flying Sheep. Listen! A wizard once lodged here and gave us a marvellous pillow called the Pillow of Kantan: he who sleeps on it sees all his future in a moment's dream.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Where is this pillow?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HOSTESS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>It is on the bed.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I will go and sleep upon it.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HOSTESS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And I meanwhile will heat you some millet at the fire.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI (<i>going to the bed</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>So this is the pillow, the Pillow of Kantan that I have heard such <a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a> strange tales of? Heaven has guided me to it, that I who came out t. learn the secret of life may taste the world in a dream.</p>
 <p>As one whose course swift summer-rain has stayed,<br>
 Unthrifty of the noon he turned aside<br>
 To seek a wayside dream;<br>
 Upon the borrowed Pillow of Kantan<br>
 He laid his head and slept.</p>
 <p>(<i>While </i>ROSEI<i> is still chanting these words, the </i>ENVOY<i> enters, followed by two </i>ATTENDANTS<i> who carry a litter. The </i>ENVOY<i> raps on the post of the bed</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ENVOY.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Rosei, Rosei! I must speak with you.</p>
 <p>(ROSEI<i>, who has been lying with his fan over his face, rises when the </i>ENVOY<i> begins to speak</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>But who are you?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ENVOY.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am come as a messenger to tell you that the Emperor of the Land of So <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">1</font></a> resigns his throne and commands that Rosei shall reign in his stead.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Unthinkable! I a king? But for what reason am I assigned this task?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ENVOY.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I cannot venture to determine. Doubtless there were found in your Majesty's countenance auspicious tokens, signs that you must rule the land. Let us lose no time; pray deign to enter this palanquin.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>ROSEI (<i>looking at the palanquin in astonishment</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>What thing is this? A litter spangled with a dew of shining stones? I am not wont to ride. Such splendour! Oh, little thought I <a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>
 <p>When first my weary feet trod unfamiliar roads<br>
 In kingly state to be borne to my journey's end.<br>
 is it to Heaven I ride?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>In jewelled palanquin<br>
 On the Way of Wisdom you are borne; here shall you learn<br>
 That the flower of glory fades like a moment's dream.<br>
 See, you are become a cloud-man of the sky. <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 The palaces of ancient kings<br>
 Rise up before you, Abō's Hall, the Dragon's Tower; <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 High over the tall clouds their moonlit gables gleam.<br>
 The light wells and wells like a rising tide. <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 Oh splendid vision! A courtyard strewn<br>
 With golden and silver sand;<br>
 And they that at the four sides<br>
 Pass through the jewelled door are canopied<br>
 With a crown of woven light.<br>
 In the Cities of Heaven, in the home of Gods, I had thought,<br>
 Shine such still beams on walls of stone;<br>
 Never on palace reared by hands of men.<br>
 Treasures, a thousand kinds, ten thousand kinds,<br>
 Tribute to tribute joined, a myriad vassal-kings<br>
 Cast down before the Throne.<br>
 Flags of a thousand lords, ten thousand lords<br>
 Shine many-coloured in the sky,<br>
 And the noise of their wind-flapping<br>
 Rolls round the echoing earth.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And in the east</p></dir>

 <p>And in the west<br>
 Over a golden hill of thirty cubits height<br>
 A silver moon-wheel rose,<br>
 To prove his words who sang<br>
 "In the Palace of Long Life <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>

 <p>For ever and ever<br>
 The land secure;<br>
 The flower of glory waxing;<br>
 The "herb of increase," joy-increasing<br>
 Into the cup we pour.<br>
 See! from hand to hand it goes.<br>
 "I will drink," he cries.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ROSEI.</p><dir>

 <p>Go circling, magic cup,</p></dir>

 The goblet whirling in the eager stream;<br>

 It shall not fail, it shall not fail,<br>
 The fountain of our Immortality;<br>
 He draws, and yet it wells;<br>
 He drinks, and to his taste it is as sweet<br>
 As the Gods' deathless food.<br>
 His heart grows airy; day and night<br>
 In unimagined revel, incomparable pride and glory<br>
 Eternally shall pass.</p></dir>

 Fade as a dream when Death their sequence closes.<br>

 This monarch's fifty years of state.<br>
 Ambition, length of days,<br>
 Revels and kingly rule,<br>
 All, all has ended thus, all was a dream<br>
 Dreamed while the millet cooked.</p></dir>
