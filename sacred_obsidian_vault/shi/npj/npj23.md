 <i></i><p>A COURTIER.<br>
 AN OLD GARDENER.<br>
 THE PRINCESS.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>COURTIER.</p>
 <p>I am a courtier at the Palace of Kinomaru in the country of Chikuzen. You must know that in this place there is a famous pond called the Laurel Pond, where the royal ones often take their walks; so it happened that one day the old man who sweeps the garden here caught sight of the Princess. And from that time he has loved her with a love that gives his heart no rest.</p>
 <p>Some one told her of this, and she said, "Love's equal realm knows no divisions," <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a> and in her pity she said, "By that pond there stands a laurel-tree, and on its branches there hangs a drum. Let him beat the drum, and if the sound is heard in the Palace, he shall see my face again."</p>
 <p>I must tell him of this.</p>
 <p>Listen, old Gardener! The worshipful lady has heard of your love and sends you this message: "Go and beat the drum that hangs on the tree by the pond, and if the sound is heard in the Palace, you shall see my face again." Go quickly now and beat the drum!</p>
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>With trembling I receive her words. I will go and beat the drum.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>COURTIER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Look, here is the drum she spoke of. Make haste and beat it!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>

 <p>(<i>He leaves the </i>GARDENER<i> standing by the tree and seats himself at the foot of the "Waki's pillar</i>.")</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>They talk of the moon-tree, the laurel that grows in the Garden of the Moon. . . . But for me there is but one true tree, this laurel by the lake. Oh, may the drum that hangs on its branches give forth a mighty note, a music to bind up my bursting heart.</p>
 <p>Listen! the evening bell to help me chimes;<br>
 But then tolls in<br>
 A heavy tale of day linked on to day,</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS (<i>speaking for the</i> GARDENER).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And hope stretched out from dusk to dusk.<br>
 But now, a watchman of the hours, I beat<br>
 The longed-for stroke.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I was old, I shunned the daylight,<br>
 I was gaunt as an aged crane;<br>
 And upon all that misery<br>
 Suddenly a sorrow was heaped,<br>
 The new sorrow of love.<br>
 The days had left their marks,<br>
 Coming and coming, like waves that beat on a sandy shore . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh, with a thunder of white waves<br>
 The echo of the drum shall roll.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The after-world draws near me,<br>
 Yet even now I wake not<br>
 From this autumn of love that closes<br>
 In sadness the sequence of my years.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And slow as the autumn dew<br>
 Tears gather in my eyes, to fall<br>
 Scattered like dewdrops from a shaken flower<br>
 On my coarse-woven dress.<br>
 See here the marks, imprint of tangled love,<br>
 That all the world will read.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I said "I will forget,"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And got worse torment so<br>
 Than by remembrance. But all in this world<br>
 Is as the horse of the aged man of the land of Sai; <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 And as a white colt flashes<br>
 Past a gap in the hedge, even so our days pass. <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 And though the time be come,<br>
 Yet can none know the road that he at last must tread,<br>
 Goal of his dewdrop-life.<br>
 All this I knew; yet knowing,<br>
 Was blind with folly.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Wake, wake," he cries--</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The watchman of the hours--<br>
 "Wake from the sleep of dawn!"<br>
 And batters on the drum.<br>
 For if its sound be heard, soon shall he see<br>
 Her face, the damask of her dress <br>
 Aye, damask! He does not know<br>
 That on a damask drum he beats,<br>
 Beats with all the strength of his hands, his aged hands,<br>
 But bears no sound.<br>
 "Am I grown deaf?" he cries, and listens, listens:<br>
 Rain on the windows, lapping of waves on the pool<br>
 Both these he hears, and silent only<br>
 The drum, strange damask drum.<br>
 Oh, will it never sound?<br>
 I thought to beat the sorrow from my heart,<br>
 Wake music in a damask drum; an echo of love<br>
 From the voiceless fabric of pride!</p>

 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Longed for as the moon that hides<br>
 In the obstinate clouds of a rainy night<br>
 Is the sound of the watchman's drum,<br>
 To roll the darkness from my heart.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I beat the drum. The days pass and the hours.<br>
 It was yesterday, and it is to-day.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>But she for whom I wait</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Comes not even in dream. At dawn and dusk</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GARDENER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>No drum sounds.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>She has not come. Is it not sung that those<br>
 Whom love has joined<br>
 Not even the God of Thunder can divide?<br>
 Of lovers, I alone<br>
 Am guideless, comfortless.<br>
 Then weary of himself and calling her to witness of his woe,<br>
 "Why should I endure," he cried,<br>
 "Such life as this?" and in the waters of the pond<br>
 He cast himself and died.</p></dir>

 <p>I would speak with you, madam.</p>
 <p>The drum made no sound, and the aged Gardener in despair has flung himself into the pond by the laurel tree, and died. The soul of .such a one may cling to you and do you injury. Go out and look upon him</p></dir>

 <p>Listen, people, listen!<br>
 In the noise of the beating waves<br>
 I hear the rolling of a drum.<br>
 Oh, joyful sound, oh joyful!<br>
 The music of a drum,</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>COURTIER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Strange, strange!<br>

 What is amiss, what ails her?</p></dir>

 <p>PRINCESS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Truly, by phantasy I am possessed.<br>
 Can a damask drum give sound?<br>
 When I bade him beat what could not ring,<br>
 Then tottered first my wits.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>COURTIER.</p><dir>

 <p>She spoke, and on the face of the evening pool<br>
 A wave stirred.</p></dir>

 <dir>
 
 <p>And out of the wave</p></dir>
 </dir>

 <p>A voice spoke.</p><dir>

 <p>Have washed me back to the shore.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>GHOST.</p><dir>

 Clings even now when neither wrath nor weeping<br>
 Are aught but folly.</p></dir>

 <dir>
 
 <p>One thought consumes me,<br>
 The anger of lust denied<br>
 Covers me like darkness.<br>
 I am become a demon dwelling<br>
 In the hell of my dark thoughts,<br>
 Storm-cloud of my desires.</p></dir>

 So I had resolved. Oh, why so cruelly<br>
 Set they me to win<br>
 Voice from a voiceless drum,<br>
 Spending my heart in vain?<br>
 And I spent my heart on the glimpse of a moon that slipped<br>
 Through the boughs of an autumn tree. <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_121"><font size="1">2</font></a></p></dir>

 <p>"Strike!" he cries;<br>
 "The quick beat, the battle-charge!<br>
 Loud, loud! Strike, strike," he rails,<br>
 And brandishing his demon-stick<br>
 Gives her no rest.<br>
 "Oh woe!" the lady weeps,<br>
 "No sound, no sound. Oh misery!" she wails.<br>
 And he, at the mallet stroke, "Repent, repent!"<br>
 Such torments in the world of night<br>
 Abōrasetsu, chief of demons, wields, <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a><br>
 Who on the Wheel of Fire<br>
 Sears sinful flesh and shatters bones to dust.<br>
 Not less her torture now!<br>
 "Oh, agony!" she cries, "What have I done,<br>
 By what dire seed this harvest sown?"</p></dir>

 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Clear stands the cause before my eyes;<br>
                              I know it now.<br>
 By the pool's white waters, upon the laurel's bough<br>
 The drum was hung.<br>
 He did not know his hour, but struck and struck<br>
 Till all the will had ebbed from his heart's core;<br>
 Then leapt into the lake and died.<br>
 And while his body rocked<br>
 Like driftwood on the waves,<br>
 His soul, an angry ghost,<br>
 Possessed the lady's wits, haunted her heart with woe,<br>
 The mallet lashed, as these waves lash the shore,<br>
 Lash on the ice of the eastern shore.<br>
 The wind passes; the rain falls<br>
 On the Red Lotus, the Lesser and the Greater. <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 The hair stands up on my head.<br>
 "The fish that leaps the falls<br>
 To a fell snake is turned," <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">2</font></a></p></dir>

 <p>In the Kwanze School this play is replaced by another called <i>The Burden of Love</i>, also attributed to Seami, who writes (<i>Works</i>, p. 166): "<i>The Burden of Love</i> was formerly <i>The Damask Drum</i>." The task set in the later play is the carrying of a burden a thousand times round the garden. The Gardener seizes the burden joyfully and begins to run with it, but it grows heavier and heavier, till he sinks crushed to death beneath it.</p>
