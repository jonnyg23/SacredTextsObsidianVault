 <h3 align="CENTER">KUMASAKA</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">EBOSHI-ORI</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BENKEI ON THE BRIDGE</h3>
 <p>THESE three plays deal with the boyhood of the hero Yoshitsune, whose child-name was Ushiwaka.</p>
 <i></i><p>Eboshi-ori is a <i>genzai-mono</i>, that is to say a play which describes events actually in progress. In <i>Kumasaka</i> these same events are rehearsed by the ghost of one who participated in them. There are two other well-known Yoshitsune plays, <i>Funa-Benkei</i> and <i>Ataka</i>. In the former the phantoms of the dead Taira warriors attack the boat in which Yoshitsune and Benkei are riding; in the latter occurs the famous scene called the <i>Kwanjinchō</i>, in which Benkei pretends to read out from a scroll a long document which he is in reality improvising on the spot. (See Mr. Sansom's translations of these two plays in the <i>Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan</i>, 1911.) The <i>Kwanjinchō</i> was borrowed by the popular stage, and became one of the favourite "turns" of the great Danjūrō (1660-1703) and his successors.</p>
