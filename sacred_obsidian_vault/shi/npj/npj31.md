 <i></i><p>HAKURYŌ (a Fisherman).<br>
 ANOTHER FISHERMAN.<br>
 ANGEL.<br>
 CHORUS.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>FISHERMAN.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Loud the rowers' cry<br>
 Who through the storm-swept paths of Mio Bay<br>
 Ride to the rising sea.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am Hakuryō, a fisherman whose home is by the pine-woods of Mio.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>BOTH.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"On a thousand leagues of lovely hill clouds suddenly close;<br>
 But by one tower the bright moon shines in a clear sky." <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 A pleasant season, truly: on the pine-wood shore<br>
 The countenance of Spring;<br>
 Early mist close-clasped to the swell of the sea;<br>
 In the plains of the sky a dim, loitering moon.<br>
 Sweet sight, to gaze enticing<br>
 Eyes even of us earth-cumbered<br>
 Low souls, least for attaining<br>
 Of high beauty nurtured.<br>
 Oh unforgettable! By mountain paths<br>
 Down to the sea of Kiyomi I come<br>
 And on far woodlands look,<br>
 Pine-woods of Mio, thither<br>
 Come, thither guide we our course.<br>
 Fishers, why put you back your boats to shore,<br>
 No fishing done?<a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a><br>
 Thought you them rising waves, those billowy clouds<br>
 Wind-blown across sea?<br>
 Wait, for the time is Spring and in the trees<br>
 The early wind his everlasting song<br>
 Sings low; and in the bay<br>
 Silent in morning calm the little ships,<br>
 Ships of a thousand fishers, ride the sea.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>(<i>The second </i>FISHERMAN<i> retires to a position near the leader of the </i>CHORUS<i> and takes no further part in the action</i>.)</p>
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Now I have landed at the pine-wood of Mio and am viewing the beauty of the shore. Suddenly there is music in the sky, a rain of flowers, unearthly fragrance wafted on all sides. These are no common things; nor is this beautiful cloak that hangs upon the pine-tree. I come near to it. It is marvellous in form and fragrance. This surely is no common dress. I will take it back with me and show it to the people of my home. It shall be a treasure in my house.</p>
 <p>(<i>He walks four steps towards the Waki's pillar carrying the feather robe</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL (<i>entering through the curtain at the end of the gallery</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Stop! That cloak is mine. Where are you going with it?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>This is a cloak I found here. I am taking it home.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>It is an-angel's robe of feathers, a cloak no mortal man may wear. Put it back where you found it.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>How? Is the owner of this cloak an angel of the sky? Why, then, I will put it in safe keeping. It shall be a treasure in the land, a marvel to men unborn. <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">1</font></a> I will not give back your cloak.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh pitiful! How shall I cloakless tread<br>
 The wing-ways of the air, how climb <a name="page_180%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 180 </font></a><br>
 The sky, my home?<br>
 Oh, give it back, in charity give it back.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>No charity is in me, and your moan<br>
 Makes my heart resolute.<br>
 Look, I take your robe, hide it, and will not give it back.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Describing his own actions. Then he walks away</i>.)</p>
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Like a bird without wings,<br>
 I would rise, but robeless</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p>
 <p>To the low earth you sink, an angel dwelling<br>
 In the dingy world.</p>
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>This way, that way.<br>
 Despair only.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>But when she saw he was resolved to keep it</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Strength failing.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Help none ...</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then on her coronet,<br>
 Jewelled as with the dew of tears,<br>
 The bright flowers drooped and faded. <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 O piteous to see before the eyes,<br>
 Fivefold the signs of sickness<br>
 Corrupt an angel's form.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I look into the plains of heaven,<a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 181</font></a><br>
 The cloud-ways are hid in mist, The path is lost.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh, enviable clouds,<br>
 At your will wandering<br>
 For ever idle in the empty sky<br>
 That was my home!<br>
 Now fades and fades upon my ear<br>
 The voice of Kalavink, <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Daily accustomed song.<br>
 And you, oh you I envy,<br>
 Wild-geese clamorous<br>
 Down the sky-paths returning;<br>
 And you, O seaward circling, shoreward sweeping<br>
 Swift seagulls of the bay:<br>
 Even the wind, because in heaven it blows,<br>
 The wind of Spring I envy.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Listen. Now that I have seen you in your sorrow, I yield and would give you back your mantle.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh, I am happy! Give it me then!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Wait. I have heard tell of the dances that are danced in heaven.<br>
 Dance for me now, and I will give back your robe.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am happy, happy. Now I shall have wings and mount the sky again.<br>
 And for thanksgiving I bequeath<br>
 A dance of remembrance to the world,<br>
 Fit for the princes of men:<br>
 The dance-tune that makes to turn<br>
 The towers of the moon,<br>
 I will dance it here and as an heirloom leave it<br>
 To the sorrowful men of the world. <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 182</font></a><br>
 Give back my mantle, I cannot dance without it.<br>
 Say what you will, I must first have back the robe.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Not yet, for if I give back your robe, not a step would you dance, but fly with it straight to the sky.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>No, no. Doubt is for mortals;<br>
 In heaven is no deceit.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am ashamed. Look, I give back the robe.</p>
 <p>(<i>He gives it to her and she takes it in both hands</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The heavenly lady puts on her garment,<br>
 She dances the dance of the Rainbow Skirt, of the Robe of Feathers.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The sky-robe flutters; it yields to the wind.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Sleeve like a flower wet with rain . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>HAKURYŌ.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The first dance is over.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Shall I dance?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The dance of Suruga, with music of the East?<br>
 Thus was it first danced.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>(<i>The </i>ANGEL<i> dances, while the </i>CHORUS<i> sings the words of the dance, an ancient Shintō chant</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Why name we<br>
 Wide-stretched and everlasting.<br>
 The sky of heaven?<br>
 Two gods <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">1</font></a> there came of old <a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 183</font></a><br>
 And built, upon ten sides shut in,<br>
 A measured world for men;<br>
 But without limit arched they<br>
 The sky above, and named it<br>
 Wide-stretched and everlasting."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Thus is the Moon-God's palace:<br>
 Its walls are fashioned<br>
 With an axe of jade.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>In white dress, black dress,<br>
 Thrice ten angels<br>
 In two ranks divided,<br>
 Thrice five for the waning,<br>
 Thrice five for nights of the waxing moon,<br>
 One heavenly lady on each night of the moon<br>
 Does service and fulfils<br>
 Her ritual task assigned.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I too am of their number,<br>
 A moon-lady of heaven.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Mine is the fruit of the moon-tree, <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">1</font></a> yet came I to the East incarnate, <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 Dwelt with the people of Earth, and gave them<br>
 A gift of music, song-dance of Suruga.</p>
 <p>Now upon earth trail the long mists of Spring;<br>
 Who knows but in the valleys of the moon<br>
 The heavenly moon-tree puts her blossom on?<br>
 The blossoms of her crown win back their glory:<br>
 It is the sign of Spring.<br>
 Not heaven is here, but beauty of the wind and sky.<br>
 Blow, blow, you wind, and build<br>
 Cloud-walls across the sky, lest the vision leave us<br>
 Of a maid divine!<br>
 This tint of springtime in the woods, <a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 184</font></a><br>
 This colour on the headland,<br>
 Snow on the mountain, <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Moonlight on the clear shore,--<br>
 Which fairest? Nay, each peerless<br>
 At the dawn of a Spring day.<br>
 Waves lapping, wind in the pine-trees whispering<br>
 Along the quiet shore. Say you, what cause<br>
 Has Heaven to be estranged<br>
 From us Earth-men; are we not children of the Gods,<br>
 Within, without the jewelled temple wall, <a name="fr_179"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 Born where no cloud dares dim the waiting moon,<br>
 Land of Sunrise?"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>ANGEL.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>May our Lord's life<br>
 Last long as a great rock rubbed<br>
 Only by the rare trailing<br>
 Of an angel's feather-skirt. <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 Oh, marvellous music!<br>
 The Eastern song joined<br>
 To many instruments;<br>
 Harp, zither, pan-pipes, flute,<br>
 Belly their notes beyond the lonely clouds.<br>
 The sunset stained with crimson light<br>
 From Mount Sumeru's side; <a name="fr_181"></a><a href="#fn_179"><font size="1">4</font></a><br>
 For green, the islands floating on the sea;<br>
 For whiteness whirled<br>
 A snow of blossom blasted<br>
 By the wild winds, a white cloud<br>
 Of sleeves waving.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Concluding the dance, she folds her hands and prays</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>NAMU KIMYO GWATTEN-SHI.<br>
 To thee, O Monarch of the Moon,<br>
 Be glory and praise,<br>
 Thou son of Seishi Omnipotent! <a name="fr_182"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>

 <p align="CENTER">(<i>She dances "Ha no Mai" the Broken Dance</i>.)</p>
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>She has danced many dances,<br>
 But not yet are they numbered,<br>
 The dances of the East.<br>
 And now she, whose beauty is as the young moon,<br>
 Shines on us in the sky of midnight,<br>
 The fifteenth night,<br>
 With the beam of perfect fulfilment,<br>
 The splendor of Truth.<br>
 The vows <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_181"><font size="1">1</font></a> are fulfilled, and the land we live in<br>
 Rich with the Seven Treasures<br>
 By this dance rained down on us,<br>
 The gift of Heaven.<br>
 But, as the hours pass by,<br>
 Sky-cloak of feathers fluttering, fluttering,<br>
 Over the pine-woods of Mio,<br>
 Past the Floating Islands, through the feet of the clouds she flies,<br>
 Over the mountain of Ashitaka, the high peak of Fuji,<br>
 Very faint her form,<br>
 Mingled with the mists of heaven;<br>
 Now lost to sight.</p></dir>
