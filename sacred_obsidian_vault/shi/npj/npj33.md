 <h3 align="CENTER">NOTE ON TANIKŌ AND IKENIYE.</h3>
 <p>BOTH of these plays deal with the ruthless exactions of religion; in each the first part lends itself better to translation than the second. <i>Tanikō</i> is still played; but <i>Ikeniye</i>, though printed by both Owada and Haga, has probably not been staged for many centuries.</p>
 <p>The pilgrims of <i>Tanikō</i> are <i>Yamabushi</i>, "mountaineers," to whom reference has been made on page <a href="npj06.htm#page_33">33</a>. They called themselves <i>Shugenja</i>, "portent-workers," and claimed to be the knight-errants of Buddhism. But their conduct seems to have differed little from that of the <i>Sōhei</i> (armed monks) who poured down in hordes from Mount Hiyei to terrorize the inhabitants of the surrounding country. Some one in the <i>Genji Monogatari</i> is said to have "collected a crowd of evil-looking Yamabushi, desperate, stick-at-nothing fellows."</p>
 <i></i><p>Ikeniye, the title of the second play, means "Pool Sacrifice," but also "Living Sacrifice," i. e. human sacrifice.</p>
