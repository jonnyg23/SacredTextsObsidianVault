 FOLLOWER.<br>
 USHIWAKA.<br>
 CHORUS.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p>
 <p>I am one who lives near the Western Pagoda. My name is Musashibō Benkei. In fulfillment of a certain vow I have been going lately by night at the hour of the Ox <a name="fr_62"></a><a href="#fn_60"><font size="1">1</font></a> to worship at the Gojō Temple. Tonight is the last time; I ought soon to be starting.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Hie! Is any one there?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>FOLLOWER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Here I am.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I sent for you to tell you that I shall be going to the Gojō Temple to-night.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>FOLLOWER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I tremble and listen. But there is a matter that I must bring to your notice. I hear that yesterday there was a boy of twelve or thirteen guarding the Gojō Bridge. They say he was slashing round with his short sword as nimble as a bird or butterfly. I beg that you will not make your pilgrimage to-night. Do not court this peril.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>That's a strange thing to ask! Why, were he demon or hobgoblin, he could not stand alone against many. We will surround him and You shall soon see him on his knees.</p>
 <p> </p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a></p>
 <p>FOLLOWER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>They have tried surrounding him, but he always escapes as though by magic, and none is able to lay hands on him.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>When he seems within their grasp</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>FOLLOWER.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>From before their eyes</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Suddenly he vanishes.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>This strange hobgoblin, elfish apparition,<br>
 Into great peril may bring<br>
 The reverend limbs of my master.<br>
 In all this City none can withstand the prowess<br>
 Of this unparalleled monster.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>If this is as you say, I will not go to-night; and yet . . . No. It is not to be thought of that such a one as Benkei should be affrighted by a tale. To-night when it is dark I will go to the bridge and humble this arrogant elf.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And while he spoke,<br>
 Evening already to the western sky had come;<br>
 Soon the night-wind had shattered and dispersed<br>
 The shapes of sunset. Cheerless night<br>
 Came swiftly, but with step too slow<br>
 For him who waits.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>(<i>A Comic interlude played by a bow-master is sometimes used here to fill in the time while</i> BENKEI <i>is arming himself</i>.)</p></dir>
 </dir>
 </dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>USHIWAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am Ushiwaka. I must do as my mother told me; "Go up to the, Temple <a name="fr_63"></a><a href="#fn_61"><font size="1">1</font></a> at daybreak," she said. But it is still night. I will go to <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a> Gojō Bridge and wait there till suddenly</p>
 <p>Moonlight mingles with the rising waves;<br>
 No twilight closes<br>
 The autumn day, but swiftly<br>
 The winds of night bring darkness.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS (<i>speaking for</i> USHIWAKA).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh! beauty of the waves! High beats my heart,<br>
 High as their scattered pearls!<br>
 Waves white as dewy calabash <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_62"><font size="1">1</font></a> at dawn,<br>
 By Gojō Bridge.<br>
 Silently the night passes,<br>
 No sound but my own feet upon the wooden planks<br>
 Clanking and clanking; still I wait<br>
 And still in vain.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The night grows late. Eastward the bells of the Three Pagodas toll.<br>
 By the moonlight that gleams through leaves of these thick cedar-trees<br>
 I gird my armour on;<br>
 I fasten the black thongs of my coat of mail.<br>
 I adjust its armoured skirts.<br>
 By the middle I grasp firmly<br>
 My great halberd that I have loved so long.<br>
 1 lay it across my shoulder; with leisurely step stride forward.<br>
 Be he demon or hobgoblin, how shall he stand against me?<br>
 Such trust have I in my own prowess. Oh, how I long<br>
 For a foeman worthy of my hand!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>USHIWAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The river-wind blows keen;<br>
 The night is almost spent,<br>
 But none has crossed the Bridge.<br>
 I am disconsolate and will lie down to rest.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then Benkei, all unknowing, <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a><br>
 Came towards the Bridge where white waves lapped.<br>
 Heavily his feet clanked on the boards of the Bridge.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>USHIWAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>And even before he saw him Ushiwaka gave a whoop of joy.<br>
 "Some one has come," he cried, and hitching his cloak over his shoulder<br>
 Took his stand at the bridge-side.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Benkei discerned him and would have spoken....<br>
 But when he looked, lo! it was a woman's form!<br>
 Then, because he had left the World, <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_63"><font size="1">1</font></a> with troubled mind he hurried on.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>USHIWAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then Ushiwaka said,<br>
 "I will make game of him," and as Benkei passed<br>
 Kicked at the button of his halberd so that it jerked into the air.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>BENKEI (<i>cries out in surprise</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Ah! fool, I will teach you a lesson!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then Benkei while he retrieved his halberd<br>
 Cried out in anger,<br>
 "You shall soon feel the strength of my arm," and fell fiercely upon him.<br>
 But the boy, not a jot alarmed,<br>
 Stood his ground and with one hand pulled aside his cloak,<br>
 While with the other he quietly drew his sword from the scabbard<br>
 And parried the thrust of the halberd that threatened him.<br>
 Again and again he parried the halberd's point.<br>
 And so they fought, now closing, now breaking.<br>
 What shall Benkei do? For when he thinks that he has conquered,<br>
 With his little sword the boy thrusts the blow aside.<br>
 Again and again Benkei strikes.<br>
 Again and again his blows are parried, <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a><br>
 Till at last even he, mighty Benkei,<br>
 Can do battle no longer.<br>
 Disheartened he steps back the space of a few bridge-beams.<br>
 "Monstrous," he cries, "that this stripling . . . No, it cannot be.<br>
 He shall not outwit my skill."<br>
 And holding out his halberd at full length before him<br>
 He rushed forward and dealt a mighty blow.<br>
 But Ushiwaka. turned and dived swiftly to the left.<br>
 Benkei recovered his halberd and slashed at the boy's skirts;<br>
 But he, unfaltering, instantly leapt from the ground.<br>
 And when he thrust at the boy's body,<br>
 Then Ushiwaka squirmed with head upon the ground.<br>
 Thus a thousand, thousand bouts they fought,<br>
 Till the halberd fell from Benkei's weary hands.<br>
 He would have wrestled, but the boy's sword flashed before him,<br>
 And he could get no hold.<br>
 Then at his wits' end, "Oh, marvellous youth!"<br>
 Benkei cried, and stood dumbfounded.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Who are you that, so young and frail, possess such daring? Tell us your name and state.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>USHIWAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Why should I conceal it from you? I am Minamoto Ushiwaka.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yoshitomo's son?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>USHIWAKA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am. And your name . . .</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS (<i>speaking for</i> BENKEI).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"I am called Musashi Benkei of the Western Pagoda.<br>
 And now that we have told our names,<br>
 I surrender myself and beg for mercy;<br>
 For you are yet a child, and I a priest.<br>
 Such are your rank and lineage, such your prowess<br>
 That I will gladly serve you. <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a><br>
 Too hastily you took me for an enemy; but now begins<br>
 A three lives' bond; henceforward <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 As slave I serve you."<br>
 So, while the one made vows of homage, the other girded up his cloak.<br>
 Then Benkei laid his halberd across his shoulder<br>
 And together they went on their way<br>
 To the palace of Kujō. <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
