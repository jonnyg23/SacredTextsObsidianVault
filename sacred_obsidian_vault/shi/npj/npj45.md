 The date of the author is unknown.</p>

In his absence the steward grows overbearing in his manner towards his mistress and her <a href="errata.htm#5">little</a> son, Hanawaka, finally compelling them to take part in the arduous labour of "bird-scaring," rowing up and down the river among the rice-fields, driving away the birds that attack the crop.</p>
