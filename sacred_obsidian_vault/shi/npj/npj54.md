 <p>Yai, yai. Where are my minions?</p>

 <p>Haa! Here we are.</p>

 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"All men are sinners." What have I to fear<br>
 More than the rest?<br>
 My name is Kiyoyori the Bird-Catcher. I was very well known on <a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a> the Terrestrial Plane. But the span of my years came to its appointed close; I was caught in the Wind of Impermanence; and here I am, marching to the Sunless Land.<br>
   Without a pang I leave the world where I was wont to dwell,<br>
   The Temporal World.<br>
   Whither, oh whither have my feet carried me?<br>
   To the Six Ways already I have come.<br>
 Why, here I am already at the meeting of the Six Ways of Existence. I think on the whole I'll go to Heaven.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>DEMON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Haha! That smells like a man. Why, sure enough here's a sinner coming. We must report him. (<i>To</i> YAMA.) Please, sir, here's the first sinner arrived already!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then bustle him to Hell at once.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>DEMON.</p>
 <dir><dir><p>"Hell is ever at hand," <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">1</font></a> which is more than<br>
 Can he said of Heaven. (<i>Seizing</i> KIYOYORI.)<br>
 Come on, now, come on! (KIYOYORI <i>resists</i>.)<br>
 Yai! yai!<br>
 Let me tell you, you're showing a great<br>
 Deal more spirit than most sinners do.<br>
 What was your job when you were on the<br>
 Terrestrial Plane?</p></dir></dir>
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I was Kiyoyori, the famous bird-catcher.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>DEMON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Bird-catcher? That's bad. Taking life from morning to night. That's very serious, you know. I am afraid you will have to go to Hell.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Really, I don't consider I'm as had as all that. I should be very much obliged if you would let me go to Heaven.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>KYOGEN 257</p>
 <p>DEMON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>We must ask King Yama about this. (<i>To</i> YAMA.) Please sir--!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Well, what is it?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>DEMON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>It's like this. The sinner says that on the Terrestrial Plane he was a well-known bird-catcher. Now that means taking life all the time; it's a serious matter, and he certainly ought to go to Hell. But when we told him so, he said we'd entirely misjudged him.</p>
 <p>What had we better do about it?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>You'd better send him to me.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>DEMON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Very well. (<i>To</i> KIYOYORI.) Come along, King Yama says he'll see you himself.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I'm coming.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>DEMON.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Here's that sinner you sent for.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Listen to me, you sinner. I understand that when you were in the world you spent your whole time snaring birds. You are a very bad man and must go to Hell at once.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>That's all very well. But the birds I caught were sold to gentlemen to feed their falcons on; so there was really no harm in it.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Falcon" is another kind of bird, isn't it?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Yes, that's right.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Well then, I really don't see that there was much harm in it.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I see you take my view. It was the falcons who were to blame, not I. That being so, I should be very much obliged if you would allow me to go straight to Heaven.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA (<i>reciting in the Nō style</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Then the great King of Hell<br>
 Because, though on the Hill of Death<br>
 Many birds flew, he had not tasted one,<br>
 "Come, take your pole," he cried, and here and now<br>
 Give us a demonstration of your art.<br>
 Then go in peace.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Nothing could be simpler.<br>
 I will catch a few birds and present them to you.<br>
 Then he took his pole, and crying<br>
 "To the hunt, to the hunt! . . ."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"To the bird-hunt," he cried,<br>
 And suddenly from the steep paths of the southern side of the Hill of Death<br>
 Many birds came flying.<br>
 Then swifter than sight his pole<br>
 Darted among them.<br>
 "I will roast them," he cried.<br>
 And when they were cooked,<br>
 "Please try one," and he offered them to the King.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA (<i>greedily</i>).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Let me eat it, let me eat it.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p align="CENTER">(<i>Eats, smacking his lips</i>.)</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Well! I must say they taste uncommonly good!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI (<i>to the</i> DEMONS).</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Perhaps you would like to try some?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a></p>
 <p>DEMONS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh, thank you! (<i>They eat greedily and snatch</i>.) I want that bit! No, it's mine! What a flavour!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>YAMA.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I never tasted anything so nice. You have given us such a treat that I am going to send you back to the world to go on bird-catching for another three years.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>KIYOYORI.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>I am very much obliged to you, I'm sure.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>CHORUS.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>You shall catch many birds,<br>
 Pheasant, pigeon, heron and stork.<br>
 They shall not elude you, but fall<br>
 Fast into the fatal snare.<br>
 So he, reprieved, turned back towards the World;<br>
 But Yama, loth to see him go, bestowed<br>
 A jewelled crown, which Kiyoyori bore<br>
 Respectfully to the Terrestrial Plane,<br>
 There to begin his second span of life.</p>
