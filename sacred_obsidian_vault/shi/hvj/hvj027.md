 <p>THE maples of Mount Ogura,<br>   If they could understand,<br> Would keep their brilliant leaves, until<br>   The Ruler of this land<br>   Pass with his royal band.</p></div>  
 <p><small>The above is the posthumous name given to Tadahira Fujiwara, Imperial Chief Minister of State; he died about the year 936. It is related that the Emperor Uda, after his abdication, visited Mount Ogura in Yamashiro province, and was so greatly struck with the autumn tints of the maples, that he ordered Tada-hira to invite his son, the Emperor Daigo, to visit the scene; and this verse was the invitation. The picture shows the Emperor with his attendants, and the maples all around him.</small></p>
