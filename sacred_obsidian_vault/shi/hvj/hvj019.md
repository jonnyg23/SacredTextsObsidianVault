 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">  Sumi-no-ye no<br> Kishi ni yoru nami<br>   Yoru sae ya<br> Yume no kayoi-ji<br> Hito-me yokuramu.  
 <p>TO-NIGHT on Sumi-no-ye beach<br>   The waves alone draw near;<br> And, as we wander by the cliffs,<br>   No prying eyes shall peer,<br>   No one shall dream we're here.</p></div>  
 <p><small>Toshi-yuki, who lived A.D. 880-907, was an officer of the Imperial Guard, and a member of the great and influential Fujiwara family. This family rose into power in the reign of the Emperor Tenchi, and became almost hereditary ministers-of-state. For a long period the Emperors chose their wives from this family only, and to this day a large number of the Japanese nobility are sprung from the same stock. Sumi-no-ye, or Sumi-yoshi, is in the Province of Settsu, near Kobe.</small></p>  
 <p>Note the word <i>yoru</i> used twice in the first instance as a verb, meaning 'to approach' and in the next line meaning 'night'. The illustration shows Toshi-yuki walking on the beach, and evidently waiting for the lady to join him.</p>
