 <p>THOUGH love, like blisters made from leaves<br>   Grown on Mount Ibuki,<br> Torments me more than I can say,<br>   My lady shall not see,<br>   How she is paining me.</p></div>  
 <p><small>The writer lived some time at the close of the tenth century. The artemisia plant (or mugwort) is used in Japan for cauterizing; a conical wad of the leaves or blossoms is placed on the spot, lit at the top, and allowed to burn down to the skin; this produces a blister, and is extremely painful. Ibuki is a hill, between the Provinces of Omi and Mino, famous for its artemisia, but <i>ibuki</i> can also stand for <i>iu beki</i>, which, in conjunction with <i>e ya wa</i>, would mean, 'Ah! how could I tell her!' But <i>eyawa</i> as one word means 'indescribable!' Notice also <i>sashimo</i> in the third and fourth lines <i>sashi-mogusa</i> means 'the artemisia plant', but <i>sashi mo</i> means 'even though it is smarting'; <i>sashimo</i>, in one word, can also mean 'in such a way'. This verse is a very good example of the way the Japanese love to play upon words. The picture seems to show Mount Ibuki with the mugwort growing on it.</small></p>
