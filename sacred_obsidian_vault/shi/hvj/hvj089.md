 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">  Naniwa e no<br> Ashi no karine no<br>   Hito yo yue<br> Mi wo tsukushite ya<br> Koi wataru beki.  
 <p>I'VE seen thee but a few short hours;<br>   As short, they seemed to me,<br> As bamboo reeds at Naniwa;<br>   But tide-stakes in the sea<br>   Can't gauge my love for thee.</p></div>  
 <p><small>This verse was written some time in the twelfth century; and Naniwa is the ancient name of Ōsaka.</small></p>  
 <p>There are several double meanings in this verse lines 2 and 3 can mean either 'one section of a reed cut off between the joints', or 'one night's sleep as short as a reed'. In the fourth line also, <i>miotsukushi</i> means a tide-gauge, as explained in the note to verse No. <a href="hvj021.htm#page_20">20</a>, but the whole line, taken as printed, reads, 'How can I be already tired of thee!' The contrast here is between the length of only one section of a short reed and the long stake set up to measure the rise and fall of the tide.</p>  
 <p>The illustration seems to show the lady to whom the verse was addressed.</p>
