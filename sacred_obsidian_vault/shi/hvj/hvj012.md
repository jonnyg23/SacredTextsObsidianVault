 <p>OH! Fishers in your little boats,<br>   Quick! tell my men, I pray,<br> They'll find me at Yasoshima,<br>   I'm being rowed away<br>   Far off across the bay.</p></div>  
 <p><small>Takamura, a well-known scholar, rose from poverty to riches on being appointed a Custom-house officer for the ships trading to and from China. His enemies reported him to the Emperor as an extortioner and a thief, and he was deported to Yasoshima, a group of small islands off the coast; he is said to have composed this song and sung it to the fishing-boats, as he was being carried off. He was afterwards pardoned and reinstated, dying in the year 852.</small></p>
