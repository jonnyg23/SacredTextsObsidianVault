 <p>ALL through the long and dreary night<br>   I lie awake and moan;<br> How desolate my chamber feels,<br>   How weary I have grown<br>   Of being left alone!</p></div>  
 <p><small>This lady was the daughter of Motoyasu Fujiwara, and the wife of the Regent Kaneie; she was famous for her beauty, and lived in the reign of the Emperor Mura-kami (947-967). It is related, that her husband returned home late one night, and, having to wait a moment or two before she let him in, he angrily reproached her, and she replied with this verse (see illustration).</small></p>  
 <p><i>Yo no akuru ma</i> means 'until the dawn', but <i>akuru ma</i> also suggests that the room is empty when he is away.</p>
