 <p>WE met but for a moment, and<br>   I'm wretched as before;<br> The <i>tide</i> shall <i>measure</i> out my life,<br>   Unless I see once more<br>   The maid, whom I adore.</p></div>  
 <p><small>The composer of this verse was the son of the Emperor Yōzei, who reigned A.D. 877-884; he was noted for his love-affairs, and he died in the year 943.</small></p>  
 <p><i>Mi wo tsukushite mo</i> means 'even though I die in the attempt', but <i>miotsukushi</i> is a graduated stick, set up to measure the rise and fall of the tide; and Naniwa, the modern seaport of Osaka, seems to have been inserted chiefly as the place where this tide-gauge was set up. The poet may have meant, that the river of his tears was so deep as to require a gauge to measure it; or, as Professor MacCauley reads it, he was hinting, that if he could not attain his ends his body would be found at the tide-gauge in Naniwa Bay. The picture seems to show the poet on the verandah and his lady-love looking through the screen.</p>
