 <p>THE village of my youth is gone,<br>   New faces meet my gaze;<br> But still the blossoms at thy gate,<br>   Whose perfume scents the ways,<br>   Recall my childhood's days.</p></div>  
 <p><small>The writer of this verse, who lived A.D. 884-946, was a nobleman at Court, one of the greatest of the classical poets, and the first writer of Japanese prose. He was the chief compiler of the <i>Kokinshiu</i>, in which work he was assisted by the authors of verses Nos. <a href="hvj030.htm#page_29">29</a>, <a href="hvj031.htm#page_30">30</a> and <a href="hvj034.htm#page_33">33</a>. This work consists of twenty volumes, containing some eleven hundred verses, and was completed in the year 922. It is related that Tsura-yuki once visited a friend after a long absence; and on being asked jestingly by the latter, how he could remember the way after such a long interval of time, the poet broke off a spray of blossoms from a plum tree growing at the entrance, and presented it to his friend with this impromptu verse.</small></p>
