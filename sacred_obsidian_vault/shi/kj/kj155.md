 <p>After this Karu-fukuro, <a name="fr_2285"></a><a href="#fn_2280"><font size="1">1</font></a> ancestor of the Dukes of Yama of Sasaki in Afumi, <a name="fr_2286"></a><a href="#fn_2281"><font size="1">2</font></a> said [to King Oho-hatsuse]: "At Kuta <a name="fr_2287"></a><a href="#fn_2282"><font size="1">3</font></a> [and?] on the moor of Kaya at Wata in Afumi, boars and deer are abundant. Their legs as they stand are like a moor [covered] with <i>wogi</i>; <a name="fr_2288"></a><a href="#fn_2283"><font size="1">4</font></a> the horns they point up are like withered trees." At this <a href="errata.htm#98">time</a> [King Oho-hatsuse], taking with him King Ichi-no-be-no-oshiha, made a progress to Afumi, and on reaching this moor, each of them built a separate temporary palace to lodge in. Then next morning, before the sun had risen, King Oshiha with a tranquil heart rode along on his august horse, and, reaching and standing beside King Oho-hatsuse's temporary Palace, said to King Oho-hatsuse's attendants: "Is he not awake yet? He must [309] be told quickly [that I am come]. It is already day-light. <a name="fr_2289"></a><a href="#fn_2284"><font size="1">5</font></a> He must come to the hunting-ground,"—and forthwith urging his horse, he went forth. Then the people who served the august person of King Oho-hatsuse</p>

 <p>said: "As [King Oshiha] is a violent-spoken <a name="fr_2290"></a><a href="#fn_2285"><font size="1">6</font></a> Prince, thou shouldst be on thy guard, and likewise it were well to arm thine august person." Forthwith he put on armour underneath his clothes, took and girded on him his bow and arrows, rode off on horseback, and in a sudden interval setting his horse by the side [of the other King's], took out an arrow, shot King Oshiha down, forthwith moreover cut his body [to pieces], put [them] into a horse's manger, and buried them level with the earth.</p>
