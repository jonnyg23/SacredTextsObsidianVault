 <p>Again once, when the Heavenly Sovereign made a progress up Mount Kadzuraki, the various officials <a name="fr_2337"></a><a href="#fn_2332"><font size="1">1</font></a> were all clothed in green-stained garments with red cords that had been granted to them. At that time there were people ascending the mountain on the opposite mountain acclivity quite similar to the order of the Heavenly Monarch's retinue. Again the style of the habiliments and likewise the people were similar and not distinguishable. <a name="fr_2338"></a><a href="#fn_2333"><font size="1">2</font></a> Then the Heavenly Sovereign gazed, and sent to ask, saying: "There being no other King in Yamato excepting myself, what person goeth thus?" The style of the reply again was like unto the commands of a Heavenly Sovereign. Hereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, being very angry, fixed his arrow [in his bow], and the various officials all fixed their arrows [in their bows]. Then those people also all fixed their arrows [in their bows]. So the Heavenly Sovereign again sent to ask, saying: "Then tell thy name. Then let each of us tell his name, and [then] let fly his arrow." Thereupon [the other] replied, saying: "As I was the first to be asked, I will be the first to tell my name. I am the Deity who dispels with a word the evil and with a word the good,—the Great Deity of Kadzuraki, Lord of One</p>

I understood not that thy great person would be revealed;" <a name="fr_2340"></a><a href="#fn_2335"><font size="1">4</font></a>—and having thus spoken, he, beginning by his great august sword and likewise bow and arrows, took off the garments which the hundred officials had on, and worshipfully presented them [to the Great Deity]. <a name="fr_2341"></a><a href="#fn_2336"><font size="1">5</font></a> Then the Great Deity, Lord of One Word, clapping his hands, <a name="fr_2342"></a><a href="#fn_2337"><font size="1">6</font></a> accepted the offering. So when the Heavenly Sovereign made his progress back, the Great Deity came down the mountain, <a name="fr_2343"></a><a href="#fn_2338"><font size="1">7</font></a> and respectfully escorted him to the entrance <a name="fr_2344"></a><a href="#fn_2339"><font size="1">8</font></a> of the Hatsuse mountain. So it was at that time the Great Deity Lord of One Word was revealed.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_2333"></a><a href="kj165.htm#fr_2338">399:2</a> The original has the character <a name="img_40000"></a>
 <img src="img/40000.jpg">, out of which it is hard to make sense. Motowori's proposal to consider it put by error for <a name="img_40001"></a>
 <img src="img/40001.jpg">, has therefore been adopted, though the translator feels by no means sure that it is a happy one. According to the strict Chinese sense of <a name="img_40002"></a>
 <img src="img/40002.jpg">, it would not fit with this passage any <a href="errata.htm#103">better</a> than <a name="img_40003"></a>
 <img src="img/40003.jpg">; but in Japanese we may be justified in understanding <a name="img_40004"></a>
 <img src="img/40004.jpg"> to mean "not distinguishable."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2334"></a><a href="kj165.htm#fr_2339">400:3</a> In the original: <a name="img_40005"></a>
 <img src="img/40005.jpg"><a name="img_40006"></a>
 <img src="img/40006.jpg">. The import of the obscure expression "dispelling with a word the good" is not rendered much more intelligible by Motowori's attempt to explain it. For Kadzuraki see LV, Note. 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2335"></a><a href="kj165.htm#fr_2340">400:4</a> Literally, "that there would be a present (or manifest) great person."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_2337"></a><a href="kj165.htm#fr_2342">400:6</a> In token of joy, says Motowori.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2338"></a><a href="kj165.htm#fr_2343">400:7</a> The characters <a name="img_40007"></a>
 <img src="img/40007.jpg">, rendered by "came down the mountain," are evidently the result of a copyist's carelessness. The translation follows Motowori's proposal to emend the text to <a name="img_40008"></a>
 <img src="img/40008.jpg">.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2339"></a><a href="kj165.htm#fr_2344">400:8</a> Literally "mouth."</p>
