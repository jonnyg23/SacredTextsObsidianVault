 <p>Then His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness said to the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity: "Owing to the sincerity of my intentions I have, in begetting children, gotten delicate females. judging from this, <a name="fr_372"></a><a href="#fn_369"><font size="1">1</font></a> I have undoubtedly gained the victory! With these words, and impetuous with victory, he broke down the divisions of the ricefields <a name="fr_373"></a><a href="#fn_370"><font size="1">2</font></a> laid out by the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity, filled up the ditches, and moreover strewed [53] excrements <a name="fr_374"></a><a href="#fn_371"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the palace where she partook of the great food. <a name="fr_375"></a><a href="#fn_372"><font size="1">4</font></a> So, though he did thus, the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity upbraided him not, <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_373"><font size="1">5</font></a> but said: "What looks like excrements must be something that His Augustness mine elder brother has vomited through drunkenness. Again, as to his breaking down the divisions of the rice</p>

 <p>fields and filling up the ditches, it must be because he grudges the land [they occupy <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_374"><font size="1">6</font></a>] that His Augustness mine elder brother acts thus." But notwithstanding these apologetic words, he still continued his evil acts, and was more and more [violent]. As the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity sat in her awful <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_375"><font size="1">7</font></a> weaving-hall <a name="fr_379"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">8</font></a> seeing to the weaving of, the august garments of the Deities, he broke a hole in the top <a name="fr_380"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">9</font></a> of the weaving-hall, and through it let fall a heavenly piebald horse [54] which he had flayed with a backward flaying, <a name="fr_381"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">10</font></a> at whose sight the women weaving the heavenly garments were so much alarmed that impegerunt privatas partes adversis radiis et obierunt. <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_379"><font size="1">11</font></a></p>

 <img src="img/06200.jpg">, which in Chinese does not necessarily signify a <i>rice</i>-field. But in Japanese it seems to have been always limited to this narrower meaning, to which likewise the context here clearly points.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_371"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_374">61:3</a> In the original written <a name="img_06201"></a>
 <img src="img/06201.jpg"> which is partly ideographic and partly phonetic for <i>kuso-mari</i>. Motowori interprets it to signify "excrements and urine"; but the parallel passage of the "Chronicles" which he himself quotes goes to prove that <i>mari</i> had not the latter meaning, as does also another well-known passage in the "Tale of a Bamboo-Cutter."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_372"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_375">61:4</a> <a name="img_06202"></a>
 <img src="img/06202.jpg"> read <i>oh-nihe</i>. The word <i>nihe</i> now denotes "a sacrifice," and <i>oh-nihe no matsuri</i> is the religious festival of the tasting of the first new rice of the season.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_373"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_376">61:5</a> We might, following classical usage, translate the Verb <i>togamezu</i>, which is written phonetically, by the words "took no heed" or "made no observation"; but in this passage it certainly seems to have the stronger and more specialized signification of "upbraiding," "scolding," which attaches to it in the colloquial dialect.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_374"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_377">62:6</a> <i>I.e.</i>, he thinks that none of the land should be wasted in ditches and embankments, but should all be devoted to the production of food.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_375"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_378">62:7</a> The character used is <a name="img_06203"></a>
 <img src="img/06203.jpg"> "to shun," which in Japanese has approximately the meaning of "sacred." Thus a certain family of priests <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a> was called by the name of <i>Imibe</i>, lit. "the shunning clan," on account of the uncleanness from which they were bound to abstain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_376"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_379">62:8</a> Written with characters signifying literally "garment-house," but the meaning, as understood by the native commentators is that given in the text.</p>

 <img src="img/06300.jpg">. This character is taken by the native commentators in the sense of <a name="img_06301"></a>
 <img src="img/06301.jpg">, <i>mune</i>, "ridge-pole."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_378"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_381">62:10</a> <i>I.e.,</i> it is supposed, beginning at the tail. That this was considered criminal may be seen by comparing Sect. XCVII. Note 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_379"></a><a href="kj022.htm#fr_382">62:11</a> In the parallel passage of the "Chronicles" it is the goddess who injures herself with her shuttle, but without dying of the effects of the accident.</p>
