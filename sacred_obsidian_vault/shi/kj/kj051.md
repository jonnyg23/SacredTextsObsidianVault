 <p>palace raised on one foot, <a name="fr_886"></a><a href="#fn_882"><font size="1">12</font></a> and offered them a great august banquet. Removing thence, they dwelt for one [131] year at the palace of Wokoda <a name="fr_887"></a><a href="#fn_883"><font size="1">13</font></a> in Tsukushi. Again making a progress up <a name="fr_888"></a><a href="#fn_884"><font size="1">14</font></a> from that land, they dwelt seven years at the palace of Takeri <a name="fr_889"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">15</font></a> in the land of Agi. <a name="fr_890"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">16</font></a> Again removing, and making a progress up from that land, they dwelt eight years at the palace of Takashima <a name="fr_891"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">17</font></a> in Kibi. <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">18</font></a> So when they made their progress up from that land, they met in the Hayasuhi <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">19</font></a> Channel a person riding towards them on the carapace of a tortoise, and raising his wings <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">20</font></a> as he angled. Then they called to him to approach, and asked him, saying: "Who art thou?" He replied, saying: "I <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">21</font></a> am an Earthly Deity. <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">22</font></a>" Again they asked him, saying: "Knowest thou the sea-path?" He replied, saying: "I know it well." Again they asked him, saying: "Wilt thou follow and respectfully serve us?" He replied, saying: "I will respectfully serve you." So they pushed a pole <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">23</font></a> across to him, drew him into the august vessel, and forthwith conferred [132] on him the designation of Sawa-ne-tsu-hiko <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">24</font></a> (<small>This is the ancestor of the Rulers of the land of Yamato.</small>) <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">25</font></a> So when they went up from that land they passed the Namihaya <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">26</font></a> Crossing, and brought up at the haven of Shirakata. <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">27</font></a> At this time Nagasune-biko <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">28</font></a> of Tomi <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">29</font></a> raised an army, and waited to go out to fight [against them]. Then they took the shields that had been put in the august vessel, and disembarked. So they called that place by the name of Tate-dzu. <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">30</font></a> It is what is now called the Tadetsu of Kusaka. <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">31</font></a> Therefore when fighting with the Prince of Tomi, <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">32</font></a> His Augustness Itsu-se was pierced in his august hand by the Prince of Tomi's hurtful arrow. <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_903"><font size="1">33</font></a> So then he said: "It is not right for me, an august</p>

 <p>child of the Sun-Deity, to fight facing the sun. It is for this reason that I am stricken by the wretched villain's <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">34</font></a> hurtful hand. I will henceforward turn round, and smite him with my back to the sun." Having [thus] decided, he, on making a progress round from the southern side, reached the sea of Chinu, <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">35</font></a> and washed the blood on his august hand: so it is called the sea of Chinu. <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">36</font></a> Making a progress round from thence, and arriving at the river-mouth of Wo <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">37</font></a> in the land of Ki, <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">38</font></a> he said: "Ah! that I should die stricken by the wretched villain's hand!" and expired <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">39</font></a> as a valiant man. <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">40</font></a> So that river-mouth was called the river mouth of Wo. <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">41</font></a> The Mausoleum, too, is on Mount Kama <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">42</font></a> in the land of Ki.</p>

 <img src="img/16102.jpg"> (<i>hashira</i>) however means, not "foot," but "pillar "; and the commentators understand both passages to allude <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></a> to a single pillar, which supported the weight of the entire building,—either as being in the middle of it, or (as Motowori opines) by standing in the water, the edifice, according to this view, being built on a river-bank overhanging the stream.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_883"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_887">160:13</a> This name signifies "hillock rice-field."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_886"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_890">160:16</a> Etymology uncertain. This name is better known (without the <i>nigori</i> of the second syllable) as Aki. Aki is one of the provinces on the northern shore of the Inland Sea.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_890"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_894">160:20</a> <i>I.e.</i>, as Motowori supposes, beckoning by waving his sleeve.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_891"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_895">160:21</a> The First Personal Pronoun is represented by the humble character <a name="img_16200"></a>
 <img src="img/16200.jpg">, "servant."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_892"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_896">160:22</a> See Sect. I, Note 11. Motowori wishes us here to understand this expression to mean "I am a Deity (<i>i.e.</i> a person) of the country-side." But there is no sufficient reason for departing from the precedent of rendering the characters <a name="img_16201"></a>
 <img src="img/16201.jpg">, which are constantly used antithetically to <a name="img_16202"></a>
 <img src="img/16202.jpg">, by "Earthly Deity" (as opposed to "Heavenly Deity.") Motowori likewise proposes to append to this sentence the clause "and my name is Udzu-biko," which is found in the "Chronicles." The name may be taken to signify "precious prince."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_893"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_897">160:23</a> The characters <a name="img_16203"></a>
 <img src="img/16203.jpg"> are evidently, as Motowori says, meant to represent the Japanese word <i>sawo</i>, "pole," though they do not properly convey that meaning. Probably they are corrupt.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_894"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_898">160:24</a> <i>I.e.</i>, if we suppress the syllable <i>ne</i>, which seems to be either Expletive or Honorific, the "prince of the pole."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_895"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_899">160:25</a> <i>Yamato no kuni no Miyadzuko</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_896"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_900">160:26</a> This is the reading of the name preferred by Mabuchi and Motowori; but the usual form <i>Naniha</i> seems to be at least as well supported by early documentary evidence. The "Chronicles" tell us that the place was called <i>Nani-haya</i> <a name="img_16204"></a>
 <img src="img/16204.jpg">, <i>i.e.</i> "wave swift," in allusion to the strong current which the Emperor Jim-mu here encountered; and at the present day it is still a dangerous place for navigation. The name properly denotes the water at the mouth of the River Yodo, on <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></a> which stands the modern town of Ohosaka (Ōzaka), for whose name Naniha is still often used as a poetical synonym. <a name="img_16300"></a>
 <img src="img/16300.jpg">, "wave flowers," and <a name="img_16301"></a>
 <img src="img/16301.jpg">, "dangerous waves," are alternative ways of writing it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_897"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_901">160:27</a> Motowori says that he cannot explain the etymology of this word; but "white sandbank" would seem a simple and obvious derivation. The Shirakata here mentioned is, according to Motowori, that situated in the province of Idzumo.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_898"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_902">160:28</a> <i>I.e.</i>, the Prince of Nagasune. A plausible interpretation of <i>nagasune</i> would be "long-shank," which would give us Prince Long-Shank as the name of the worthy here mentioned; but the "Chronicles" states that Nagasune was properly the name of a place. The characters with which it is written, moreover, signify not exactly "long shank," but "long marrow," a designation which would have no evident personal applicability.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_899"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_903">160:29</a> A legend in the "Chronicles" connects the name of this place with the word <i>tobi</i>, "a kite," it being there related that a miraculous gold-coloured kite came and perched on the Emperor Jim-mu's bow, and helped him to the victory. Probably the legend grew out of the name of <i>Tobi</i>, which is obscure and may have had had nothing to do with a "kite "originally.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_900"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_904">160:30</a> <i>I.e.</i>, "shield-haven." But <i>conf</i>. next Note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_901"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_905">160:31</a> The real etymology of <i>Tada-tsu</i> seems to be "knot-grass-haven," <a href="errata.htm#25">and</a> probably <i>Taka-tsu</i> (for <i>Takatsu</i>), which is mentioned in Sect. LXIX, Note 29, is but another form of the same name. Kusaka is a well-known name in the annals of early Japan. Its signification is obscure, and the characters (<a name="img_16302"></a>
 <img src="img/16302.jpg">), with which it is written, are particularly curious. There were two Kusaka, one in the province of Kahachi and the other in Idzumi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_902"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_906">160:32</a> Viz., <i>Nagasune-biko</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_903"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_907">160:33</a> The wording of the original <a name="img_16303"></a>
 <img src="img/16303.jpg"> is very curious: Motowori reads it <i>Tomi-bike ga ita-ya wo ohashite</i>. Immediately below we have <a name="img_16304"></a>
 <img src="img/16304.jpg">.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_904"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_908">161:34</a> The character is <a name="img_16305"></a>
 <img src="img/16305.jpg">, properly "slave."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_905"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_909">161:35</a> The most likely derivation of this name is from <i>chi-numa</i>, "eulalia lagoon," the fact that it will also bear the interpretation of "blood-lagoon "being probably but a coincidence of which the mythopoeic faculty took advantage.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_906"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_910">161:36</a> Here written with characters signifying "blood-lagoon."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_907"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_911">161:37</a> <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></a> The characters rendered "river-mouth "are <a name="img_16400"></a>
 <img src="img/16400.jpg">, literally "water. gate; but here, as elsewhere, "river-mouth "seems to be the signification meant to be conveyed. Rivers in <a href="errata.htm#26">Japan</a>, even at the present day, do not bear one continuous name along their entire course, and there would be nothing unnatural in the fact of the water at the mouth of the river having a special designation. One of the significations of <i>wo</i> is "man," and the legendary etymology of the name given immediately below rests on the assumption that such is the meaning of wo in this place. Even Motowori, however, is not satisfied with it, and it is probably erroneous.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_908"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_912">161:38</a> See Sect. XXII, Note 14.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_909"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_913">161:39</a> The Chinese character <a name="img_16401"></a>
 <img src="img/16401.jpg">, which is here used, is one that specially denotes the demise of an Emperor.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_910"></a><a href="kj051.htm#fr_914">161:40</a> Probably the sense meant to be conveyed is that he expired with a <a href="errata.htm#27">gesture</a> of anger and defiance.</p>
