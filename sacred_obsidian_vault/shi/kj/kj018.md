 <p>At this time His Augustness the Male-Who-Invites greatly rejoiced, saying; "I, begetting child after child, have at my final begetting gotten. three illustrious children," [with which words,] at once jinglingly taking off and shaking the jewel-string <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">1</font></a> forming his august necklace, he bestowed it on the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity, saying: "Do Thine Augustness rule the Plain-of-High-Heaven." With this charge he bestowed it on her. Now the name of this august necklace was the August-Store-house-Shelf-Deity. <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">2</font></a> Next he said of His Augustness Moon-Night-Possessor: "Do Thine Augustness rule the Dominion of the "Night." <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">3</font></a> Thus he charged him. Next he said to His-Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness: "Do Thine Augustness rule the Sea-Plain." <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>
