 <p>Thereupon the eight hundred myriad Deities took counsel together, and imposed on High-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness a fine of a thousand tables, <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">1</font></a> and likewise cut his beard, and even caused the nails of his fingers and toes to be pulled out, and expelled him with a divine expulsion. Again he begged food of the Deity Princess-of-Great-Food. <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">2</font></a> Then the Princess-of-Great-Food took out all sorts of dainty things from her nose, her mouth, and her fundament, and made them up into all sorts [of dishes], which she offered to him. But His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness watched her proceedings, considered that she was offering up to him filth, and at once killed the Deity Princess-of-Great-Food. So the things that were born in the body of the Deity who had been killed were [60] [as follows]: in her head were born silkworms, in her two eyes were born rice-seeds, in her two ears was born millet, <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">3</font></a> in her nose were born small beans, <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">4</font></a> in her private parts was born barley, <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">5</font></a> in her fundament were born large beans. <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">6</font></a> So His Augustness the Deity-Producing-Wondrous-Ancestor <a name="fr_424"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">7</font></a> caused them to be taken and used as seeds.</p>
