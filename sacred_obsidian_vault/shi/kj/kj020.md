 <p>So thereupon His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness said: "If that be so, I will take leave <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity, and depart." [With these words] he forthwith went up to Heaven, whereupon all the mountains and rivers shook, and every land and country quaked. So the Heaven-Shining-Great-August Deity, alarmed at the noise, said: 'The reason of the ascent hither of His Augustness my elder brother <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">2</font></a> is surely no good intent. <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">3</font></a> It is only that he wishes to wrest my land from me." And she forthwith, unbinding her august hair, twisted it into august bunches; and both into the left and into the right august bunch, as likewise into her august head-dress and likewise on to [46] her left and her right august arm, <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">4</font></a> she twisted an augustly complete [string] of curved jewels eight feet</p>

Then His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness replied, saying: "I have no evil intent. It is only that when the Great-August-Deity [our father] spoke, deigning to enquire the cause [47] of my wailing and weeping, I said 'I wail because I wish to go to my deceased mother's land,'—whereupon the Great-August-Deity said: 'Thou shalt not dwell in this land,' and deigned to expel me with a divine expulsion. It is therefore solely with the thought of taking leave of thee and departing, that I have ascended hither. I have no strange intentions." Then the Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity said: "If that be so, whereby shall I know the sincerity of thine intentions?' Thereupon His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness replied, saying: "Let each of us swear, <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">11</font></a> and produce children."

 <p><a name="fn_319"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_322">52:1</a> <a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a> The English locution "to take leave" exactly represents the Chinese character here used which, from having the sense of "asking permission," has come to mean "bidding adieu."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_320"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_323">52:2</a> He was her younger brother. But see what is said on the subject of names expressive of relationship on <a href="kj005.htm#page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</a> of Introduction. The phonetic characters <a name="img_05500"></a>
 <img src="img/05500.jpg"> are here used to represent <a name="img_05501"></a>
 <img src="img/05501.jpg">, "elder brother."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_321"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_324">52:3</a> Literally "heart," here and elsewhere.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_322"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_325">52:4</a> Or "hand."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_323"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_326">53:5</a> The original is here obscure, but the translator has, as usual. followed the Chinese characters as far as possible, and has been chiefly guided by Moribe's interpretation. According to this, the "eight feet" (which Moribe takes to mean simply "several feet") must be supposed to refer to the length of the necklace which, he says, probably resembled a Buddhist rosary, only that the beads were somewhat larger. For a discussion of the various interpretations to which this phrase descriptive of the Sun-Goddess's ornaments may be subjected, see Note 4 to Mr. Satow's third paper on the "Rituals" in Vol. IX Pt. II, p. 198 of these "Transactions," and Moribe's "Examination of Difficult Words," Vol. II. pp. 4-5, <i>s.v.</i> <i>Ya-saka-ni no iho-tsu no mi sumaru no tama</i>. Mr. Satow, adopting some of the bolder etymologies of the Japanese commentators, translates thus: "the ever-bright curved (or glittering) jewels, the many assembled jewels," and concludes that "a long string of, perhaps, claw-shaped stone beads" was what the author meant to describe.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_324"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_327">53:6</a> Hirata supposes this additional quiver to have been slung in front.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_325"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_328">53:7</a> Motowori's long note on the expression <i>taka-tomo</i>, to be found in Vol. VII, pp. 39-40 of his "Commentary" seems to prove that "high-low-sounding elbow-pad" (<a name="img_05502"></a>
 <img src="img/05502.jpg"> being written phonetically for <a name="img_05503"></a>
 <img src="img/05503.jpg">) is the most likely meaning,—these pads, of which one was worn on the left elbow, having been made of skin. Arawi Hakuseki however takes <a name="img_05504"></a>
 <img src="img/05504.jpg"> in its <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a> literal sense of "bamboo" and Moribe suggests the (<a name="img_05600"></a>
 <img src="img/05600.jpg">) which occurs so often in proper names with the signification of "bold," "brave," or "stout."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_326"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_329">53:8</a> The reading <i>yu-hara</i>, here rendered "top [of the bow]" is doubtful, and <i>yu-hadsu</i>, "bow-notch," has been proposed as an emendation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_327"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_330">53:9</a> <i>I.e.</i>, "both legs penetrated into the ground up to the thigh," a proof of the vigour with which she used her limbs in stamping.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_328"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_331">53:10</a> Lit. "bubble-snow."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_329"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_332">53:11</a> <i>I.e.</i>, "pledge our faith," "bind ourselves," in order to show forth the sincerity of our intentions.—Hirata has a long note on the word <i>ukehi</i>, here rendered "swear" (elsewhere as a Substantive, "oath,") which the student will do well to consult. It is contained in his "Exposition of the Ancient Histories," Vol. VII, pp. 61-63.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_330"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_333">53:12</a> <i>Ame-no-yasu-kaha</i> (according to Motowori's reading <i>Ame-no-yasu-no-kaha</i>), our Milky Way. The "Chronicles of Old Matters of Former Ages" perhaps preserve the true etymology of the word by writing it <i>Ama-no-ya-se-kaha</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "the Heavenly River of eight currents (or reaches)." This would mean simply "a broad river." The text literally says: "having placed the Tranquil River of Heaven in the middle," etc.; but the sense of the clause is that given in the translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_331"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_334">53:13</a> These words seem, as Motowori says. to have been erroneously brought in here from the next sentence, where they come in appropriately.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_332"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_335">54:14</a> <i>Ame-no-ma-na-wi</i>. The interpretation adopted is that which has the authority of Motowori and Hirata. Perhaps only "Heavenly Well" is intended. The above authorities warn us that the word <i>wi</i>, "well," was not in ancient days restricted to its modern sense, but was used to designate any place at which water could be drawn, and Motowori thinks that Heaven contained several such. That mentioned in the text seems to have been a pool in the bed of the Tranquil River of Heaven.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_333"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_336">54:15</a> This is the interpretation of the original name <i>Ta-kiri-bime-no-mikoto</i> which is proposed by Moribe. It is less far-fetched, and agrees better with the name of the sister deity Princess-of-the-Torrent, than do the other explanations that have been attempted. The alternative name is <i>Oki-tsu-shima-no-mikoto</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_334"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_337">54:16</a> <i>Ichiki-shima-hime-no-mikoto</i>, <i>ichiki</i> being an unusual form of <i>itsuki</i>. The island, which is in the Inland Sea, is still celebrated, but bears in common parlance the name of <i>Miya-shima</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "Temple Island." <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a> The alternative name is <i>Sa-yori-bime-no-mikato</i>, in which <i>sa</i> is an Ornamental Prefix not calling for translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_335"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_338">54:17</a> <i>Tagi-tsu-hime-no-mikoto</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_336"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_339">54:18</a> <i>Masa-ka-a-katsu-kachi-hayabi-ame-no-oshi-ho-mimi-no-mikoto</i>. The word <i>mimi</i> (<a name="img_05700"></a>
 <img src="img/05700.jpg"> "ears") forms part of a large number of Ancient Japanese proper names. Motowori, who of course passes over in silence the fact that large ears are considered lucky, not only in Japan, <i>but also in China and Korea</i>, suggests the etymology <i>hi hi</i> or <i>bi bi</i> (<a name="img_05701"></a>
 <img src="img/05701.jpg">), <i>i.e.</i>, the word "wondrous" or "miraculous" repeated. But there are examples of such names in which the interpretation of <i>mimi</i> as "ears" is unavoidable. Thus Prince Umayado (commonly called <i>Shō-to-ku Tai-shi</i>) had also the name of <i>Yatsu-mimi no Tai-shi</i> <a name="img_05702"></a>
 <img src="img/05702.jpg"> bestowed upon him on account of his extraordinary intelligence. Is it not therefore simpler in all cases to allow to the word this its natural meaning? The proper names in mi do however undoubtedly offer some difficulty, and Motowori scarcely seems content with his own derivation of the troublesome syllable. <i>Oshi</i>, as in other cases, is taken to represent <i>ohoshi</i>, "great"; and after much hesitation the translator has followed Motowori in regarding ho likewise as an abbreviated form of that word.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_337"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_340">54:19</a> <i>Ame-no</i> signifies "of Heaven" or "heavenly." The syllables hohi are incomprehensible.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_338"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_341">54:20</a> <i>Amatsu-hiko-ne-no-mikoto</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_339"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_342">54:21</a> Or "hand."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_340"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_343">55:22</a> <i>Iku-tsu-hiko-ne-no-mikoto</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_341"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_344">55:23</a> This god does not seem to be known by any other name: but is conjectured by Hirata to be identical with <i>Ame-no-hohi</i>, the second of these divine brothers. <i>Kumanu</i>, or less archaically <i>Kumano</i>, is said to be, not the well-known Kumano in the province of Kishiu, but a place in Idzumo near Suga (see Sect. XIX, Notes 1 and 2). The name is written with the characters, <a name="img_05703"></a>
 <img src="img/05703.jpg">, "bear moor." The native commentators however interpret it as a corruption of <i>Komori-nu</i>, <a name="img_05704"></a>
 <img src="img/05704.jpg">, "the moor of retirement," on account of a tradition preserved in the "Chronicles" of Izanami (the Female-Who-invites) having been interred at the Kishiu Kumano.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_342"></a><a href="kj020.htm#fr_345">55:24</a> There is no footnote 24—<i>JBH</i>.</p>
