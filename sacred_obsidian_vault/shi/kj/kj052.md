 <p>So when His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko made a progress round from thence, and reached the village of Kumanu, <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">1</font></a> a large bear came out of the mountain, <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">2</font></a> and forthwith disappeared into it. Then His Augustness Kamu-yamato-ihare-biko suddenly fainted away, and his august army likewise all fainted and fell prostrate. At this time Takakurazhi <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">3</font></a> (<small>this is the name of a person</small>) <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">4</font></a> of Kumanu came bearing one cross-sword <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">5</font></a> to the place where the august-child of the Deity was lying prostrate, and presented it to him, upon which the august child of the Heavenly Deity forthwith rose up, and said: "How long I have slept!" So when he accepted the cross-sword, the savage Deities of the mountains of Kumanu all spontaneously fell cut down. <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">6</font></a> Then the whole august</p>

 <p>army, that had been bewildered and had fallen prostrate, awoke and rose up. So the august child of the Heavenly Deity asked him how he had got the cross-sword. Takakurazhi [135] replied, saying: "I was told in a dream that</p>  
 <p>the two Deities the Heaven-Shining-Great-Deity <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">7</font></a> and the High Integrating Deity <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">8</font></a> commanded and summoned the Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity, <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">9</font></a> and charged him [thus]: 'The Central Land of Reed-Plains <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">10</font></a> is painfully uproarious,—it is. <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">11</font></a> Our august children must be ill at ease. As [therefore] the Central Land of Reed-Plains is a land which thou specially subduedst, thou the Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity shalt descend [thither].' Then he replied, saying: 'I <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">12</font></a> will not descend [myself], but I have the cross-sword wherewith I specially subdued the land. (<small>The name by which this sword is called is the Deity Thrust-Snap; <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">13</font></a> another name by which it is called is the Deity Awful-Snap, <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">14</font></a> and another name for it is the August-Snap-Spirit, <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">15</font></a> This sword dwells in the temple of the Deity of Isonokami</small>) <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">16</font></a> The manner in which I will send this sword down will be to perforate the ridge of [the roof of] Takakurazhi's stone-house, <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">17</font></a> and drop it through. (So the Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male-Deity instructed me, saying: 'I will perforate the ridge of [the roof of] thy store-house, and drop this sword through. <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">18</font></a>) So do thou, with the good eyes of [136] morning, <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">19</font></a> take it and present it to the august child of the Heavenly Deity.' So, on my searching my store-house early next morning in accordance with the instructions of the dream, there really was a cross-sword there. So I just present this cross-sword to thee."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_913"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_917">164:1</a> This name signifies "bear-moor." The name is now generally pronounced <i>Kumano</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_914"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_918">164:2</a> Motowori ingeniously conjectures the text of this passage <a name="img_16500"></a>
 <img src="img/16500.jpg">, which makes no sense, to be a copyist's error for <a name="img_16501"></a>
 <img src="img/16501.jpg">, which <a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></a> gives the meaning rendered in the translation. The running hand form of <a name="img_16602"></a>
 <img src="img/16602.jpg"> might well be mistaken for that of the single character <a name="img_16603"></a>
 <img src="img/16603.jpg">. The editor of 1687 is less happy in his conjecture that the character intended may be <a name="img_16604"></a>
 <img src="img/16604.jpg">, "crocodile." This incident of the bear was thought important by the compiler for a mention of it to be inserted in his Preface. (See <a href="kj007.htm#page_5">p. 5</a>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_915"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_919">164:3</a> The signification of this name is not clear. Taking <i>zhi</i> as an apocopated <i>nigori’ed</i> form of the Postposition <i>shita</i>, we might suppose <i>taka-kura-zhi</i> to signify "under the high store house" in allusion to the legend which forms the subject of this section. There are, however, reasons for doubting this etymology. (See Motowori's Commentary, Vol. XVIII, p. 48). In the Preface we have simply <i>Takahura</i>, without the final syllable <i>zhi</i>; but the omission of <i>zhi</i> in that place is almost certainly to be accounted for on euphonic grounds.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_916"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_920">164:4</a> This note to the original is believed to be an interpolation,</p>
 <p><a name="fn_917"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_921">164:5</a> <a name="img_16603"></a>
 <img src="img/16603.jpg">. Motowori avers that the character <a name="img_16604"></a>
 <img src="img/16604.jpg">, "cross," has no importance, and should be neglected in reading. But this assertion seems gratuitous in the face of, for instance, such a Chinese locution as <a name="img_16605"></a>
 <img src="img/16605.jpg">. We may be justified, perhaps, in paying no special heed to the Numeral "one" in this place, which Motowori neglects in his <i>kana</i> reading of the text.</p>

 <img src="img/16606.jpg">, "august," which should form the penultimate member of this compound name, is here omitted.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_925"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_929">165:13</a> <i>Sazhi-futsu no kami</i>. The translator follows Tanigaha Shisei in considering <i>sazhi</i> (Tanigaha Shisei in his "Perpetual Commentary" reads <i>sashi</i> without the <i>nigori</i>) to mean "thrust." For the rendering of <i>futsu</i> as "snap" in this and the two following names <i>conf</i>. Sect. VIII, Note 8. Moribe, however, in his "<i>Ikzu no Chi-waki</i>," asserts that <i>futsu</i> is but an alternative form of <i>futo</i>, "broad," "thick," or "vast," as shown by the existence of the phrase <i>ma-futsu no kagami</i>, "a true vast mirror."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_929"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_933">165:17</a> Properly what is known to Anglo-Orientals as a "godown."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_930"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_934">165:18</a> The sentence here placed between braces is proposed by Motowori to supplement an evident lacuna in the text.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_931"></a><a href="kj052.htm#fr_935">165:19</a> Or, "luckily with morning eyes." Motowori remarks that even in modern times, special joy is felt at a good discovery made in the morning.</p>
