 <p>Then Prince Oho-hatsuse, <a name="fr_2267"></a><a href="#fn_2262"><font size="1">1</font></a> who at that time was a lad, was forthwith grieved and furious on hearing of this event, and went forthwith to his elder brother King Kurobiko, <a name="fr_2268"></a><a href="#fn_2263"><font size="1">2</font></a> and said: "They have slain <a name="fr_2269"></a><a href="#fn_2264"><font size="1">3</font></a> the Heavenly Sovereign. What shall be done?" But King Kurobiko was not startled, and was of unconcerned heart. <a name="fr_2270"></a><a href="#fn_2265"><font size="1">4</font></a> There upon King Oho-hatsuse reviled his elder brother, saying: "For one thing it being the Heavenly Sovereign, for another thing it being thy brother, how is thy heart without concern? <a name="fr_2271"></a><a href="#fn_2266"><font size="1">5</font></a> What! not startled, but unconcerned on hearing that they have slain thine elder brother!"—and forthwith he clutched him by the collar; dragged him out, drew his sword, and slew him. Again, going to his elder brother King Shiro-biko, he told him the circumstances as before. The unconcernedness again was like [that shown by] King Kuro-biko. [So King Oho-hatsuse,] having forthwith clutched him by the collar, pulled him along, and dug a pit on reaching Woharida, <a name="fr_2272"></a><a href="#fn_2267"><font size="1">6</font></a> buried him as he stood, <a name="fr_2273"></a><a href="#fn_2268"><font size="1">7</font></a> so that by the time he had been buried up to the loins, both his eyes burst out, and he died. <a name="fr_2274"></a><a href="#fn_2269"><font size="1">8</font></a></p>
