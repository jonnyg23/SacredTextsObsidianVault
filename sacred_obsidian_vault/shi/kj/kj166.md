 <p>Again when the Heavenly Sovereign made a progress to Kasuga to wed Princess Wodo, <a name="fr_2345"></a><a href="#fn_2340"><font size="1">1a</font></a> daughter of the Grandee Satsuki of Wani, <a name="fr_2346"></a><a href="#fn_2341"><font size="1">2a</font></a> a maiden met him by the way, and forthwith seeing the Imperial progress, ran and hid on the side of a mound. So he composed an august Song. That august Song said:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"Oh! the mound where the maiden is hiding! Oh for five hundred metal spades! then might [we] dig her out!" <a name="fr_2347"></a><a href="#fn_2342"><font size="1">3</font></a></div>  
 <p>So that mound was called by the name of the Mound [321] of the Metal Spade. <a name="fr_2348"></a><a href="#fn_2343"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_2340"></a><a href="kj166.htm#fr_2345">401:1a</a> <i>Wodo-hime</i>. The signification of this name is obscure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2341"></a><a href="kj166.htm#fr_2346">401:2a</a> <i>Wani no Satsuki no omi</i>. For <i>Wani</i> see Sect. LXII, Note 11. <i>Satsuki</i> is the old Japanese name of the fifth moon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_2342"></a><a href="kj166.htm#fr_2347">401:3</a> Moribe thus paraphrases this Song: "The Monarch had met a girl carrying a spade in her hand, and as she was beautiful, wished to address her; but she ran off and hid on the hill-side, leaving her spade behind her. His words express a desire for five hundred spades like hers, with which to break down the hill-side and dig her out. . . . It is in joke that he talks of the maiden who was on the <i>other side</i> of the hill as being <i>inside</i> it." That in ancient times all digging implements were not made of metal will be seen by reference to Sect. CXXIV, Note 9.</p>
