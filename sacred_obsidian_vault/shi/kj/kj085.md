 <p><a name="fn_1559"></a><a href="kj085.htm#fr_1563">254:2</a> <i>Kashikade no oho-tomo-be</i>. This "gentile name" originally denoted one who was butler, steward, or cook, in the Emperor's household. The tradition of its origin is preserved in the "Chronicles."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1560"></a><a href="kj085.htm#fr_1564">254:3</a> Motowori supposes that the mention both in his history and in the "Chronicles of Japan" of the planting of bamboos on the banks of this pool or lake should be attributed to the rarity of such a proceeding in ancient times.</p>
