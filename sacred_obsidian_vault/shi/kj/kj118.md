 <p>Again there came over [to Japan] the ancestor of the Hada Rulers, <a name="fr_1916"></a><a href="#fn_1911"><font size="1">1</font></a> the ancestor of the Aya Suzerains, <a name="fr_1917"></a><a href="#fn_1912"><font size="1">2</font></a> and likewise a man who knew how to distil liquor, and whose name was Nim-pan, <a name="fr_1918"></a><a href="#fn_1913"><font size="1">3</font></a> while another name for him was Susukori. <a name="fr_1919"></a><a href="#fn_1914"><font size="1">4</font></a> So this [man] Susukori distilled some great august liquor, and presented it to the Heavenly Sovereign, who, excited with the great august liquor that had been presented to him augustly sang, saying:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">"I have become intoxicated with the august liquor distilled by Susukori. I have become intoxicated with the soothing liquor, with the smiling liquor." <a name="fr_1920"></a><a href="#fn_1915"><font size="1">5</font></a></div>  
 <p>On his walking out singing thus, he hit with his [254] august staff a large stone in the middle of the Ohosaka <a name="fr_1921"></a><a href="#fn_1916"><font size="1">6</font></a> road, upon which the stone ran away. So the proverb says: "Hard stones get out of a drunkard's way."</p>

 <img src="img/31500.jpg">, a "gentile name." <i>Hada</i> is the native Japanese word used as the equivalent of the Chinese name <a name="img_31501"></a>
 <img src="img/31501.jpg">, <i>Ch’in</i>. Its origin is uncertain.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1912"></a><a href="kj118.htm#fr_1917">315:2</a> <i>Aya no ataha</i> <a name="img_31502"></a>
 <img src="img/31502.jpg">, a "gentile name." The use of Aya to represent the Chinese name <a name="img_31503"></a>
 <img src="img/31503.jpg">, <i>Han</i>, is as difficult to account for as is that of Hada mentioned in the preceding Note.</p>

 <img src="img/31504.jpg">. Another and more Japanese-like reading, <i>Niho</i>, is invented by Motowori; but the older editors read <i>Nim-pan</i> according to the usual Sinico-Japanese sound of the characters. The modern Korean reading would be In-pon.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1915"></a><a href="kj118.htm#fr_1920">315:5</a> Thus translated, this Song is too clear to need any explanation. The lines, however, which are rendered by "with the soothing liquor, with the smiling liquor."—in Japanese <i>koto nagu shi we-guzhi-ni</i>,—are in reality extremely obscure, and Moribe understands them to signify, "Oh! <a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a> how difficult it is for me to speak! Oh! how ill at ease I am!" In order to do so he has, however, to change and add to the text; and the translator, though not sure of being in the right path, has preferred to follow Motowori, whose interpretation, without requiring any such extreme measures, yet gives a very plausible sense.</p>
