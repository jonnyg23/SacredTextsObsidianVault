 <p>Then the Heavenly Sovereign again urged a command on His Augustness Yamato-take, saying: "Subdue and pacify the savage Deities and likewise the unsubmissive people of the twelve roads of the East;" <a name="fr_1594"></a><a href="#fn_1590"><font size="1">1</font></a> and when he sent him off, joining to him Prince Mi-suki-tomo-mimi-take, <a name="fr_1595"></a><a href="#fn_1591"><font size="1">2</font></a> ancestor of the Grandees of Kibi, <a name="fr_1596"></a><a href="#fn_1592"><font size="1">3</font></a> he bestowed on [210] him a holly-wood <a name="fr_1597"></a><a href="#fn_1593"><font size="1">4</font></a> spear eight fathoms [long]. So when he had received the [Imperial] command and started off, he went into the temple of the Great August Deity of Ise, and worshipped the Deity's court, <a name="fr_1598"></a><a href="#fn_1594"><font size="1">5</font></a> forthwith speaking to his aunt, Her Augustness Yamato-hime, saying: "It must surely be that the Heavenly Sovereign thinks <a name="fr_1599"></a><a href="#fn_1595"><font size="1">6</font></a> I may die quickly; for after sending me to smite the wicked people of the West, I am no sooner come up again [to the capital] than, without bestowing on me an army, he now sends me off afresh to pacify the wicked people of the twelve circuits of the East. Consequently I think that he certainly thinks I shall die quickly." When he departed with lamentations and tears, Her Augustness Yamato-hime bestowed on him the "Herb-Quelling-Sabre," <a name="fr_1600"></a><a href="#fn_1596"><font size="1">7</font></a> and likewise bestowed on him an august bag, <a name="fr_1601"></a><a href="#fn_1597"><font size="1">8</font></a> and said: "If there should be an emergency, open the mouth of the bag."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1591"></a><a href="kj089.htm#fr_1595">260:2</a> <i>Mi-suki-tomo-mini-take-hiko</i>. <i>Mi</i> is an <a href="errata.htm#51">Honorific</a>, <i>mimi</i> probably signifies "ears," and <i>take</i> means "bravo." The words <i>suki</i> and <i>tomo</i> are obscure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1592"></a><a href="kj089.htm#fr_1596">260:3</a> <i>Kibi na omi</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1593"></a><a href="kj089.htm#fr_1597">260:4</a> Properly the <i>Olea aquifolium</i>, which resembles holly. Motowori <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></a> supposes that an entirely wooden spear or stick is here meant to be spoken of, and not the weapon with a metal point which is commonly understood by the word "spear" (<i>hoko</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1594"></a><a href="kj089.htm#fr_1598">260:5</a> Perhaps we should write "august court," for the characters <a name="img_26100"></a>
 <img src="img/26100.jpg"> in the text are evidently intended for the homonymous <a name="img_26101"></a>
 <img src="img/26101.jpg">. The court in front of the Deity's temple is what is here alluded to, and it would perhaps be a not unpardonable departure from the text to insert the Preposition "at," or "in," and translate thus: "worshipped in the Deity's court."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1595"></a><a href="kj089.htm#fr_1599">260:6</a> Here and below, the word "thinks," may be understood to mean "wishes."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1596"></a><a href="kj089.htm#fr_1600">260:7</a> <i>Kusa-nagi no tsurugi</i>. The discovery of this sword by the deity Susa-no wo ("Impetuous Male") inside one of the tails of the eight-headed serpent which he had slain, is narrated at the end of Sect. XVIII.</p>
