 <h3 align="CENTER">The Twenty-Third Figure</h3>
 <p>'As there are three persons in the Godhead, comprising but one number, thus should also men become united only in one number. But, where this does not come to pass then is fulfilled the saying: every empire that is divided in itself must pass away. Thus no empire passeth away unless it be divided against itself. The wisest construction of a house and confederation of an empire is, when they conduct themselves as one and act accordingly, so that the number may never be divided. For what can be divided is unstable and vain, and one disputes with another. But rejoice, for thou shalt become one.'</p>
