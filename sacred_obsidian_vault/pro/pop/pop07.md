 <p>'A flower groweth to the destined height. He that causeth her to grow also causeth her to fade. This happens to thee, for <i>Magic</i> hath therewith adorned thee, that thy coming up should be known, and also how thou has come to nought. For before thou wast, <i>Magic</i> hath known thee and therefore compared thee to a flower, that to-day is in bloom and to-morrow is withered. Wisdom and Fear of God would have preserved thee, but thou has overlooked it, thine own wisdom hath seduced thee.'</p>
