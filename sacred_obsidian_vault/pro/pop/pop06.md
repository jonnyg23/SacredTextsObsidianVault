 <p>'What a thing is internally is shown by its outward sign. As Nature signs her own so doth <i>Magic</i>. Thou has been signed as a devourer of all who have to do with thee. Blessed is he that is unsoiled of thee for thou leavest none in peace. <i>Magic</i> hath considered thee well and given thee thy due, but as thy beauty is only beheld and not the signs, therefore thou devourest all that touch thee. For beauty and not goodness is sought of thee.'</p>
