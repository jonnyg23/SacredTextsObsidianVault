   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER V</h3>  <h3 align="center">BENEFICS AND MALEFICS</h3>  
 <p>OF the four temperaments or qualities above mentioned, two are nutritive and prolific, viz. heat and moisture; by these all matter coalesces and is nourished: the other two are noxious and destructive, viz. dryness and cold; by these all matter is decayed and dissipated.</p>  
 <p>Therefore, two of the planets, on account of their temperate quality, and because heat and moisture are predominant in them, are considered by the ancients as benefic, or causers of good: these are Jupiter and Venus. And the Moon also is so considered for the same reasons.</p>  
 <p>But Saturn and Mars are esteemed of a contrary nature, and malefic, or causers of evil: the first from his excess of cold, the other from his excess of dryness.</p>  
 <p>The Sun and Mercury are deemed of common influence, and productive either of good or evil in unison with whatever planets they may be connected with.</p>
