 <p>THE influences of the constellations south of the zodiac, existing in a similar mode, are as follows:--</p>  
 <p><i>Piscis Australis</i>. The bright star in the mouth is of the same influence as Venus and Mercury.</p>  
 <p><i>Cetus</i> is like Saturn.</p>  
 <p><i>Orion</i>. The stars on the shoulders operate similarly to Mars and Mercury; and the other bright stars to Jupiter and Saturn.</p>  
 <p><i>Fluvius</i> (or <i>Eridanus</i>). The last bright one is of the same influence as Jupiter; the rest are like Saturn.</p>  
 <p><i>Lepus</i> is like Saturn and Mercury.</p>  
 <p><i>Canis</i>. The bright star in the mouth is like Jupiter, and partly like Mars: the others are like Venus.</p>  
 <p><i>Procyon</i>. <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">1</font></a> The bright star is like Mercury, and in some degree like Mars.</p>  
 <p><i>Hydrus</i>. The bright stars are like Saturn and Venus.</p>  
 <p><i>Crater</i> is like Venus, and in some degree like Mercury.</p>  
 <p><i>Corvus</i> is like Mars and Saturn.</p>  
 <p><i>Argo</i>. The bright stars are like Saturn and Jupiter.</p>  
 <p><i>Centaurus</i>. The stars in the human part of the figure are of the same influence as Venus and Mercury; the bright stars in the horse's part are like Venus and Jupiter.</p>  
 <p><i>Lupus</i>. The bright stars are like Saturn, and partly like Mars.</p>  
 <p><i>Ara</i> is like Venus, and also Mercury in some degree.</p>  
 <p><i>Corona Australis</i>. The bright stars are like Saturn and Jupiter.</p>  
 <p>The respective influences of the several stars have been observed by the ancients to operate in conformity with the mode pointed out in the foregoing distributions. <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_51"></a><a href="ptb14.htm#fr_51">20:2</a> "Of the fixed stars in general," Whalley says, "Those of the greatest magnitude are the most efficacious; and those in, or near, the ecliptic, more powerful than those more remote from it. Those with north latitude and declination affect us most. Those in the zenith, influence more than others, more remote. Likewise such as are in partial conjunction with, or in the antiscions of any planets, or which rise and set, or culminate with any planet, or are beheld by any planet, have an increase of power: but of themselves the fixed stars emit no rays."</p>
