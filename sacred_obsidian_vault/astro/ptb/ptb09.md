   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h3>  <h3 align="center">MASCULINE AND FEMININE</h3>  
 <p>THERE are two primary sexes, male and female; and the female sex partakes chiefly of moisture. The Moon and Venus are therefore said to be feminine, since their qualities are principally moist.</p>  
 <p>The Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are called masculine. Mercury is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>common to both genders, because at certain times he produces dryness, and at others moisture, and performs each in an equal ratio.</p>  
 <p>The stars, however, are also said to be masculine and feminine, by their positions with regard to the Sun. While they are matutine and preceding the Sun, they are masculine; when vespertine and following the Sun, they become feminine <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>And they are further regulated in this respect by their positions with regard to the horizon. From the ascendant to the mid-heaven, or from the angle of the west to the lower heaven, they are considered to be masculine, being then oriental: and in the other two quadrants, feminine, being then occidental.</p>
