   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXV</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE PLACES AND DEGREES OF EVERY PLANET</h3>  
 <p>THE signs have been subdivided by some persons into parts still more minute, which have been named places and degrees of dominion. Thus the twelfth part of a sign, or two degrees and a half, has been called a place, and the dominion of it given to the signs next succeeding. Other persons again, pursuing various modes of arrangement, attribute to each planet certain degrees, as being aboriginally connected with it, in a manner somewhat similar to the Chaldaic arrangement of the terms. But all these imaginary attributes cannot be herein detailed, for they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>receive no confirmation from nature, are not capable of being rationally demonstrated, and are, in fact, merely the offspring of scientific vanity.</p>  
 <p>The following observation, however, deserves attention, and must not be omitted.</p>  
 <p>The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes, as has been already plainly shown. <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">1</font></a> And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error in then retaining and making use of them; as the regularity of their spaces and distances, upon which their influence depends, would then be invaded and broken in upon.</p>
