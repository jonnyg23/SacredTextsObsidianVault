   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER IV</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE FAMILIARITY OF THE REGIONS OF THE EARTH WITH THE FIXED STARS</h3>  
 <p>IN addition to the rules which have been already given, respecting the familiarity of the regions of the earth with the signs and planets, it must be observed, that all fixed stars which may be posited on any line, drawn from one zodiacal pole to the other, through such parts of the zodiac as may be connected with any particular country, are also in familiarity with that particular country.</p>  
 <p>And, with regard to metropolitan cities, it is necessary to state, that those points or degrees of the zodiac, over which the Sun and Moon were in transit, at the time when the construction of any such city was first undertaken and commenced, are to be considered as sympathizing with that city in an especial manner; and that, among the angles, the ascendant is principally in accordance with it. In certain cases, however, where the date of foundation of a metropolis cannot be ascertained, the mid-heaven in the nativity of the reigning king, or other actual chief magistrate, is to be substituted, and considered as that part of the zodiac with which it chiefly sympathizes. <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
