   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER X</h3>  <h3 align="center">CHILDREN NOT REARED</h3>  
 <p>THE question which now remains to be considered, in order to complete the investigation of circumstances taking place simultaneously with the nativity, or immediately consequent thereon, is, whether the child, then born, will or will not be reared.</p>  
 <p>This inquiry is to be handled distinctly from that regarding the duration of life, although there is an apparent connection between them. The questions themselves are, indeed, similar; for it is much the same thing to inquire whether the child will be nurtured, or how long it will live; and the only distinction, between these two questions, arises from the different modes in which they are treated. For instance, the inquiry into the duration of life is to be pursued only in cases wherein there is allotted to the native some space of time, not less in duration than a solar period; that is to say, a year. Therefore, since time is also measured by smaller portions, such as months, days, and hours, and since the question, whether the native will or will not be reared, belongs to cases wherein some exuberance of evil influence threatens speedy destruction, and where life is not likely to endure throughout a whole year, the inquiry into the duration of life must consequently involve a more multifarious consideration, than that which relates to rearing; which may be at once disposed of, in a more general and summary manner.</p>  
 <p>Thus, if either of the two luminaries be in an angle, and one of the malefics be either in conjunction with that luminary, or else distant in longitude from each luminary, in an exactly equal space; so as to form the point of junction of two equal sides of a triangle, of which sides the two luminaries form the extremities, while, at the same time, no benefic star may partake in the configuration, and while the rulers of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>luminaries may be also posited in places belonging to, or controlled by, the malefics; the child, then born, will not be susceptible of nurture, but will immediately perish.</p>  
 <p>Should the configuration, made between the malefic planet and the luminaries, not exist precisely in the mode just mentioned; that is to say, should the said planet not be equally distant from both luminaries, so as to form the point of junction of two equal sides of a <a href="errata.htm#9">triangle</a>; yet should it then happen that the rays of two malefics may nearly approach the places of the two luminaries, casting an injurious influence either on both, or only one of them, and if both the said malefics be together succedent, or in opposition, to the luminaries, or if one of them be succedent, and the other in opposition, or even if only one may particularly afflict one of the luminaries, then, in any such case, no duration of life will be allotted to the child: for the supremacy of the power of the malefics extinguishes the influence favourable to human nature, and tending to prolong existence.</p>  
 <p>Mars is exceedingly pernicious when succedent to the Sun, and Saturn when succedent to the Moon. But a converse effect takes place when either of these planets may be in opposition to the Sun or Moon, or in elevation above them; for the Sun will then be afflicted by Saturn, and the Moon by Mars; and especially so, provided the said planets should have local prerogatives in the signs containing the luminaries, or in the sign on the ascendant. And, should a double opposition exist, by the circumstance of the luminaries being placed in two opposite angles, and by the two malefics being each so posited as to be equally distant from each luminary, the child will be born almost, if not quite, dead. Nevertheless, if the luminaries should be separating from, or be otherwise configurated with benefic planets, whose rays may be projected to parts preceding the said luminaries, the child will then live as many days, or hours, as there are degrees, numbered between the prorogator <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the nearest malefic.</p>  
 <p>If malefics should cast their rays to parts preceding the luminaries, and benefics to parts following them, the child will be abandoned at its birth; but will afterwards meet with adoption, and will live. Yet, if the malefics should be in elevation above those benefics which are thus configurated, the child, so adopted, will lead a life of misery and servitude: if, on the contrary, the benefics should be in elevation, then whoever may adopt the deserted child will supply the place of its parents. And, provided a benefic planet should either ascend with, or near in succession to the Moon, or be applying to her,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>and one of the malefics be occidental, the child's own parents will, in that case, take it again under their protection.</p>  
 <p>Rules similar to the foregoing are to be observed, when more than one child is born; for, if any one of those planets, which may be configurated towards the production of two, or even more children, should be under the west, the children will be born half dead, or deformed, and imperfect in body. And, if the planet so situated should also be beneath the malefics, the children will not be susceptible of nurture, or their life will be of the shortest span.</p>
