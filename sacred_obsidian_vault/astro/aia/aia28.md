   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXV.</h3>  <h3 align="center">JUDGMENTS CONCERNING THE SECOND HOUSE.</h3>  
 <p>WHETHER <i>the Querent shall be rich? or have a competent Fortune? By what Means attain it? The time when? and of it shall continue?</i> </p>  
 <p>Whoever interrogates, the lord of the ascendant and the ☽ are invariably his significators.</p>  
 <p>Consider the sign on the 2d, its lord, and the planets therein, or aspecting the cusp or its lord; also the ⊕.</p>  
 <p>If you find the planets all angular or even succeedent, if direct and swift in motion, it is a good sign. If in good houses, direct, and moderately well dignified, it is also a good sign. Those two rules are general.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 1st, the ☽, and lord of the 2d, be joined together, or if they have good aspect to the lord of the 2d, or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>if ♃ or ♀ cast a good aspect to ⊕, or if the lord of the 2d or ☽ be in the ascendant, or lord of the 1st in the 2d, or benefits do ascend or be found unafflicted in the 2d, or ☊ be there, all these are testimonies that the querent need fear no poverty. As the significators may be strong, and the testimonies numerous, the querent shall be in proportion rich. Always remember to judge according to his condition in life; for, <i>quoad capax</i>, it shall happen to the interrogator.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>By what Means attain it</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 2d be in the ascendant, he may gain a fortune unexpectedly, (especially if well aspected by ♅, and this planet be strong), or gain it without much labour. If the lord of the 2d or the Moon promise substance by any mutual aspect, observe from what house the aspect is, or what house ☽ rules; if neither of these promise substance, see what house ⊕ and its dispositor be in.</p>  
 <p>If the planet assisting be in the ascendant, the querent will gain by his own industry, and, if he be a mechanic, by his own labour, care, or invention. But if the assisting planet be not lord of the 2d, he will gain by well managing his own affairs, estate, &amp;c.; or by such things as are of the nature of that planet, the sign he is in being also considered.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 2d be in the 2d, he shall profit by his own industry. If the lord of the 3d. benefit the lord of the 2d, ⊕, or other significators of wealth, he will be assisted by his neighbours, brethren, or kindred; or by removing to that quarter from whence the lord of the 3d throws the aspect.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 4th gives wealth by means of his father, or some aged person; or by taking lands, or purchasing houses, &amp;c.; or by well managing money lent him by his kindred or neighbours; or property left him by his ancestors.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>The lord of the 5th promises gain by cards or other gambling; or stock jobbing; or by holding office as an ambassador or messenger. If a man of low quality ask, by keeping an inn, &amp;c., or being porter to some institution, or connected with theatres, &amp;c., and such things as the 5th house denotes. It may be by well managing his father's estate, or receiving something thereout.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 6th gives gain by servants, dealing in small cattle, &amp;c., or by turning surgeon, &amp;c., if capable.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th gives gain by means of a wife, by the sword or warfare, by contracting bargains in his way of business, or by gaining some lawsuit, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 8th or planet therein denotes legacies, or a wife's portion, which may be unexpected at the time, (especially if ♅ assist), or he may suddenly go and settle in some country wherein he shall thrive and grow rich.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 9th, &amp;c., gives property by the wife's relations, or some neighbour of her's when he did marry; or some clergyman or lawyer shall befriend him; or if ♋ or ♓ be in the 9th, he may thrive by a distant sea voyage. But if an earthy sign be there, he may gain by removing to the part signified by that sign, and by dealing in the commodities belonging to that country, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 10th, &amp;c. promises gain by the service of the king or some great man, holding office, &amp;c. If the querent be young and of small fortune, let him learn some trade or business that may be shewn by the sign and planet in the 10th.</p>  
 <p>The 11th and its lord denote unexpected benefit by friends, or the employment of some king, nobleman or other great person.</p>  
 <p>If the fortunate aspect be cast from the 12th or by its lord, the querent will advance his fortune by great cattle or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>horse-races; or if the sign be human, that is, ♊ or ♒, by means of prisons, &amp;c., such as being governor or turnkey of a jail, a sheriff's officer, &amp;c. If the sign be ♈, ♉, or ♑, by cattle; if ♍, by corn. Herein mix your judgment with reason.</p>  
 <p>The most assured testimonies of riches are if the lords of the 1st, 2d, and ♃ be joined in the 2d, 1st, 10th, 7th, 4th, or 11th houses; or if not in ☌, if they apply by ✶ or △ and be in mutual reception. If they apply by ☐ or ☍, yet have reception, the querent will gain wealth, though with much labour and pains.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Signs of Poverty, and its Cause</i>.</p>  
 <p>If you find that the querent will <i>not</i> be rich, and he desire to know <i>why</i>, that he may the better order his affairs and be wary of such difficulties as may threaten, then carefully observe as follows. The planet afflicting most the lords of the 2d and 1st, the ☽, ⊕, or their dispositors, or the cusp of the 2d or planet therein, shews the cause. If the lord of the 1st, then the querent himself is the cause, and the house in which he is found may shew how. The lord of the 2d shews want of money or sufficient capital to set up with. The lord of the 3d shews that his kindred or neighbours will oppose him much, or undersell him, &amp;c. And in this way you may go through the twelve houses, judging the reverse of what you were instructed when the aspects, &amp;c. were good.</p>  
 <p><i>Caution</i>.--If the lord of the 2d or the dispositor of ⊕ be infortunes, yet be strong and well aspected, they may denote gain as well as ♃ or ♀, though with less satisfaction and more painstaking. Also ♃ or ♀ being afflicted, may obstruct as well as any other; for every planet must do the work for which he is by Providence assigned. Again, wherever ☋ may be found, he denotes evil by that house, as if in the 6th, by evil servants, sickness, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>If the querent shall obtain the Substance he hath lent, or which he demands</i>?</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant and ☽ are the querent's significators, the lord of the 2d denotes his substance. <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The 7th and its lord denote the person of whom he means to ask the money, and the 8th and its lord, &amp;c., his property. Observe whether the lord of the ascendant or ☽ be joined with the significator of the quesited's property, or be in good aspect with such significator. If this be so, and that significator be a fortune or very strong, he shall assuredly receive the money. If he be an infortune, and there be reception between him and the querent's significator, the querent will also receive his money, &amp;c.; but if the quesited's significator be an evil planet, and there be no reception, he will hardly ever gain his desire, or with so much delay and difficulty, he would rather wish the thing undone.</p>  
 <p>In like manner if the lord of the 8th be in the 2d with reception, it is a sign he shall gain his money, &amp;c. But if the lord of the 7th or 8th be in the 1st or 2d without reception with the querent's significators or lord of the 2d, he shall not have his desire, but may rather expect prejudice in the thing demanded.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 1st and ☽ be joined to a fortune that has dignity in the sign ascending or <i>intercepted</i> in the <i>ascendant</i>, the matter will be effected; or if joined to an infortune having such dignity, <i>with reception</i>, the business will be dispatched. Or, if the significators be joined to a fortune in the 10th or 11th, though without reception, the matter shall be perfected.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>If one shall acquire Gain, or Profit, Salary, &amp;c., from the Government, or any Nobleman, or Person of high Rank, &amp;c.</i>?</p>  
 <p>This question will serve for any other of the like nature, where the querent is much inferior in rank to the person he looks to for accomplishing his desires.</p>  
 <p>The ascendant, its lord and the ☽, represent the querent as usual, and the 10th and its lord the quesited. The 2d is the house of property for the querent, and the 11th for the person inquired about.</p>  
 <p>If you find the lord of the 1st or the ☽ joined to the lord of the 11th, or to any fortune in the 11th, not afflicted, you may affirm that the querent shall obtain his money, salary, or debt, &amp;c. Or if it happen that the ☽ and lord of the ascendant be joined to an evil planet with reception, he may expect to succeed, but not without much solicitation, and many weary efforts. If there be any evil aspect between the significators, one being an infortune and without reception, the querent will never gain what he desires.</p>  
 <p>In this question be very careful to observe the planets' true essential dignities, and their mutual receptions, and by which of their mutual dignities they receive each other. <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Time when the aforesaid Events treated of in this Chapter may happen</i>.</p>  
 <p>Herein diligently note to what planet the lord of the ascendant or ☽ applies, by ☌ or aspect. Consider how many degrees are wanting of the perfect aspect or ☌, and say that it shall be as many days as there are degrees, if they be <i>both in cadent houses</i>; if both in <i>succeedent</i> houses, so many weeks; if both in <i>angles</i>, so many months. But if the matter cannot possibly be effected in days or weeks, but requires</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p>much time, instead of months say years, and of weeks say months, and of days say weeks, &amp;c. And if one planet be in an angle, and the other in a succeedent house, they shall signify months; one succeedent, and the other cadent, they denote weeks; and when one be angular and the other cadent, months. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Some of the ancients have said, that if, at the time of a question, the planet which signifies the perfection of the thing demanded be in the same sign with the lord of the ascendant, the matter shall be brought to conclusion when they come to bodily conjunction; if the lord of the ascendant be the heavier planet, and whether there he reception or not. But if the lord of the ascendant be the lighter planet, not without reception, unless they be in an angle when the conjunction hall be effected, or that the other planet be in one of his own houses, especially that which is termed his joy. <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>I have observed that reception by house, though the aspect were a ☐, or even ☍, brings things to perfection; but that other receptions avail not in this case.</p>  
 <p><i>As regards the time when</i>; I find that if a fortune, or the ☽, or lord of the thing quesited, be in the ascendant, and have any essential dignities therein, the number of degrees between the planet and the cusp of the ascendant denote the time; days, if a moveable sign, and the business capable of being quickly perfected; months, or years, according to the sign and quality of the business.</p>

 <p>EXAMPLE.--A tradesman of <i>London</i>, in the year 1634, propounded the following queries. I have seen the experience of my judgment.</p>  
 <p>QUERIES.--1st. <i>If he should be Rich, or subsist himself without Marriage</i>?</p>  
 <p>2d. <i>By what Means he should attain Wealth</i>?</p>  
 <p>3d. <i>The Time when</i>?</p>  
 <p>4th. <i>If it would continue</i>?</p>  
 <p align="center">___________________</p>  
 <p>1st QUERY.--<i>If the Querent should be Rich, or subsist himself without Marriage</i>.</p>  
 <p>I first considered the general disposition of the planets,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a></p>  
 <p>and found the major number, especially the fortunes, swift in motion, well posited, and not afflicted. Also, that ♀, lady of the ascendant, was near <i>Cor Leonis</i>, a star of great virtue and influence; ☽ increasing in light, ♃ almost culminating. Hence I formed this general judgment, that he should live in good rank and quality among his neighbours, &amp;c. (<i>quoad capax</i>) according to his calling. Secondly, whether he should be rich or not? I considered that the lord of the 2d is in the ascendant, and being also lord of ⊕, is near <i>Spica Virgina</i>, in 18° ♎. <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">1</font></a> Then ♃ (a general significator of wealth) was in his exaltation and angular, casting his ☐ to the cusp of the ascendant, which ☐ in signs of long ascension we usually repute a △. <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">2</font></a> Also, that ☽ separated from a ✶ of ♂, lord of the 2d, &amp;c., significator of the thing demanded, and ☌ of ☿, and applied to ☌ ♀, the querent's significator; transferring the light and virtue of both ♂ and ♀, to the proper significator of the querent. The dispositor of ☽ is ☉, and he strong and powerful, the ⊕ in a fixed sign, and in the terms of ♂; from all which I judged that the querent would acquire an estate, and have a competent fortune; but as it is signified by an infortune, that he would attain it by labour and care. (<i>And so to this day he hath</i>.) And as ♂, lord of the 7th (the house of marriage), hath the most material signification of the thing demanded, viz. wealth, I advised him to marry, and said, that without marriage he should not so well subsist.</p>  
 <p>2d QUERY.--<i>By what Means he should attain Riches</i>?</p>  
 <p>In this scheme, ♂ being the planet signifying wealth, as lord of the ⊕ and the second house, and placed in the ascendant,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>signifies property got by the querent's own industry. And as ♂ is lord of the 7th, I said, he would marry a woman who would produce him a good fortune; and it more than he could well look for, and of a settled nature; which I judged by ♀, lady of his wife's house of property, being so well fortified. And as ☽ was lady of the 10th, (house of trade), and was transferring the light of ☿ and ♂ to ♀ his significator, I advised him to be diligent in his profession, and that he would thereby gain a good estate. (<i>He has since had a good fortune with his wife, money, and land, and been very successful in trade</i>). Jupiter, so strong in the 10th, was an infallible sign (according to natural causes) of plenty of trade, or a gainful profession.</p>  
 <p>3d QUERY.--<i>The Time when</i>?</p>  
 <p>All the significators oriental, and five planets swift in motion, promise property in a short time after the question; and ♂, the chief significator of the thing inquired after, being swift in motion, argues the same. The distance from the ascendant to ♂ being about two degrees, signified about two years, at which time he had a portion with his wife. The ☽ wanted 6° 27' of her ☌ with ♀: hence I concluded that about 1640 he should have very great trading, and live in excellent repute; and as ♀ is seated on the cusp of the 11th, (or house of friends), that he should have many good friends, &amp;c., by whom he should increase his estate.</p>  
 <p>4th QUERY.--<i>If the Querent should continue rich</i>?</p>  
 <p>This I resolved by the cusp of the 2d, which being a fixed sign and ⊕ therein, and ♃ in his exaltation and angular, and ♀, the dispositor of ♂, being in ♌, a fixed sign, as also the ☽ in ♌, all implied that he should continue in a plentiful estate, and that the riches God should bless him with would be permanent, and that he should never be reduced to want or poverty.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a></p>  
 <p>There was only one thing arising out of the figure, of which I cautioned him. The ☉, lord of the 11th, beholds ⊕ by ☐, as also the cusp of the 2d; and as ☉ here signifies friends, I exhorted him to avoid confiding in solar men, though of much friendship with him. In all such cases describe the planet afflicting, and you give caution sufficient. <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
