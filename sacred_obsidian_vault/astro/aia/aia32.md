   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>  <h3 align="center">OF THE SIXTH HOUSE.</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Viz. Sickness, Servants, Small Cattle, &amp;c</i>.</p>  
 <p>IN the first place, we ought to take the figure for the exact moment of the person falling sick, or rather of being obliged to take to his bed. <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Secondly, if that cannot be had, accept of that time when first any person spoke to a physician, &amp;c. regarding the patient. And if it was with his consent, the ascendant will signify him; but if unknown to him, the ascendant will denote the querent; and the house describing his relation to the person speaking of the sickness will describe the patient. (This is, supposing the physician to be an astrologer, which they formerly were; but if the patient's friend speak to an astrologer, the same rule holds.)</p>  
 <p>Thirdly, or let the physician note the time of his own first</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>speaking with the patient, <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">1</font></a> and let a figure be erected for that moment.</p>  
 <p>Then consider carefully, first, the ascendant and planets therein; secondly, the 6th house, and planets therein, thirdly, the sign and house wherein the Moon is; fourthly, how she is affected or afflicted, by what planet, in what house that planet is, and of what house be is lord.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>What Part of the Body as afflicted</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the ascendant be afflicted by an evil planet, and he retrograde, combust, peregrine, slow in motion, or in ☐ or ☍ to the lord of the 4th, 6th, 8th, or 12th, the disease is then <i>in the head</i>, or in that part or parts of the body which the planet or planets signify in the sign then ascending.</p>  
 <p>For example; if ♋ ascend, and ♄ therein, the sick party is afflicted in the head, because the ascendant signifies the head; and also has some disorder in the bowels, reins, or secrets, because ♄ in ♋ signifies those parts; or else with some rotten cough, as ♄ denotes coughs, and ♋ rules the breast. If the lord of the ascendant, ☽, or lord of the 6th, be in a sign signifying the same member or parts as ♄, or if the sign on the 6th represent the same, your judgment will be more certain; I may say, infallible. <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>I also would observe, in like manner, the 6th house, its</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>sign, lord, and planet in it. Also observe carefully the sign and house where ☽ is, her separation and application. And you may then venture safely to give judgment as to what part of the body of the sick person is grieved, and of the nature and quality of the sickness.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Cause and Nature of the Sickness</i>.</p>  
 <p>The significators in <i>fiery</i> signs, and <i>fiery</i> signs on the ascendant and 6th, shew feverish and hot complaints, hectic fevers, erysipelas, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><i>Earthy</i> signs argue long and tedious diseases, agues, intermittent fevers, and such complaints as proceed from melancholy, consumption, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><i>Airy</i> signs shew corrupt blood, gout, cutaneous diseases, scrofula, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><i>Watery</i> signs shew diseases that proceed from cold and moisture, coughs and disordered stomach, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Diseases signified by the Houses</i>.</p>  
 <p>1st. All diseases in the head, eyes, face, ears, nose, mouth, foul breath, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>2d. The throat, scrofula, quinsey, glandular swellings in the neck, sore throat, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>3d. The shoulders, arms, and hands.</p>  
 <p>4th. The stomach, breast, and lungs.</p>  
 <p>5th. Back, hind parts of the shoulders, liver, heart, sides, and stomach.</p>  
 <p>6th. Lower part of the abdomen, the intestines, liver, and reins.</p>  
 <p>7th. The hams, the flank, the small intestines, bladder, matrix and members of generation.</p>  
 <p>8th. The spine, rectum, and groin.</p>  
 <p>9th. The hips and thighs.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>10th. The knees and upper part of the leg behind the knees.</p>  
 <p>11th. The leg from the knee to the ancle, the shin-bone, shank, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>12th. The feet, ancles and toes, with all hurts or disease incident to them. <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Disease will be long or short</i>.</p>  
 <p>Have regard to the time of year, and consider that diseases commencing in the winter are usually longer, and those in summer shorter.</p>  
 <p>Diseases which proceed from ♄ are more permanent, and are generally regulated much by the motion of the ☉. Those of a hot and dry nature, which are influenced by ♂ and ☉, are short, and regulated by the motion of ☽. ♄ causes long chronic complaints, falls, bruises, blows, &amp;c.; ♃ and ☉ shorter; ♂ short, violent, and quick, such as cuts, bleedings, &amp;c. ♀ a mean between both, and such as proceed from intemperance; ☿ various and changeable, such as fits, &amp;c.; ☽ such as return at periods, as the falling sickness or epilepsy, giddiness, swimming in the head, gout, periodical illness in females, &amp;c. <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Signs of a short Disease</i>.</p>  
 <p>When the cusp of the 6th, the ☽, and the lords of the 1st and 6th, be in <i>moveable</i> signs, or the lord of the ascendant swift in motion, or going out of his own house into another, so that it be not the sign of the 6th or 12th, or if a fortune be in the 6th, you may judge that the disease will soon terminate.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Signs of a long Disease</i>.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 6th evil or afflicted, and placed in the 6th, fixed signs on its cusp, or the significators, especially the ☽, in fixed signs, are testimonies of a long and durable disease and if ♄ be lord of the 6th and in a fixed sign, or retrograde and slow in motion, he extremely prolongs the disease; but if he be in a moveable sign, or in any of his own terms, or be swift in motion, he is not then so unfortunate.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>General Signs</i>.</p>  
 <p>The disease continues but a short time if ♓ be on the cusp of the 6th. If the ☽ apply by ill aspect to the lord of the ascendant, the disease will increase. If ☽ be in the 6th in ill aspect to ♀, the disease is brought on by intemperance, either evil diet or surfeit; and if ♀ be in ♏, there is evidence of a scandalous disease. But if the patient be a female, it may be the whites or other diseases of the matrix.</p>  
 <p>The last degrees of any sign being on the cusp of the 6th, denotes that the disease is almost at an end. If the lord of the 6th apply by ill aspect to the lord of the ascendant, it is a token of the disease increasing; the same, if the lord of the 6th be in the 8th or 12th house. If the lord of the ascendant be in the 6th, and the lord of the 6th in the ascendant, the disease has been of long continuance, and will continue until one of the significators leaves the sign where he is. And if, at the time of transiting out of the sign, he meet the evil aspects of the infortunes or lords of the 4th or 8th, and they slow in motion, and it be from signs evilly aspecting one another, it is a strong sign that the sick person will then depart this life. The lord of the 6th afflicted by the ☐ or ☍ of the lord of the ascendant, the disease is grievous and hard to cure. If the lord of the 6th be in the ascendant, the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p>disease will continue, but the pain at times is small. If he be in a cadent house, the disease is not important, nor will it endure. Good planets in the 6th promise a good end to the disease; evil, the contrary. The lord of the 6th, afflicted in the 6th, 8th, or 12th, or an infortune in the 6th, denotes a disease not easily curable. The lord of the ascendant <i>and</i> ☽ free from ill aspects, both being unafflicted and strong, and not in the 6th, 8th, or 12th, is a fair testimony of recovery and health. The lord of the 1st in the 4th or 8th, if not afflicted, denotes not death; but if unfortunate, it shews great difficulty ere the party be cured. If, however, he be unfortunate by retrogradation, being combust, &amp;c., he may possibly be cured, but will afterwards relapse. If he be in evil aspect with ☽, there is danger; but, above all, if ♄ be lord of the ascendant, and be slow or retrograde, there is reason to fear a long and tedious sickness. If ♄ be strong and well qualified, the reverse.</p>  
 <p>When the lord of the ascendant is angular, strong, and unafflicted, the querent is in no danger. The ☽ slow in motion and in any aspect with him, it prolongs the infirmity, though there be at present hopes of a cure. If she be swift in motion when aspecting the lord of the ascendant, the cure will be effected in a little time. The ☽ decreasing in light, and coming to ☌, ☐, or ☍ of ♄, unless the disease be already leaving the patient, is very dangerous. The ☽ in ☌ with an oriental planet, who is swift in motion and direct, denotes a brief sickness; if joined to a retrograde and occidental planet, the contrary.</p>  
 <p>If ♏ ascend, the patient has been the cause of his own sickness by folly, anger, peevishness, or the like; especially if ♂ be therein. Both lights cadent and their dispositors unfortunate, the sickness will be severe; but if the fortunes assist, though the disease will be of long continuance, the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>party will recover beyond all expectation: the stronger the fortunes are, the more confident you may be in your judgment. If ♂ be lord of the ascendant and in the 6th, but in good aspect to ♀, there is no danger; if even in ☐ or ☍, not much.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 6th combust, retrograde, in his fall or detriment, and in the 8th, in ☌, ☐, or ☍ of ♄ or ♂, you may fear that the disease will never leave the patient till death. If the ☽ also be applying to the same aspects of the lord of the 8th, your judgment will be certain. The ☽ or lord of the 1st, in ☌, ☐, or ☍ to a benevolent planet, but he retrograde, the patient will recover, but not speedily, for it denotes relapsing out of one disease into another. When ☽ leaves ☍ of ☉, and is swiftly applying to the ☐ or ☍ of ♂, it threatens a fatal end to the disease; but if she receive a ✶ or △ of ♃ or ♀, the sick shall recover. If the ☽ be in the ascendant, and in ☌, ☐, or ☍ to ♄ or ♂, or any other evil planet, it is a token of severe illness and danger, unless she be in mutual reception with the planet afflicting.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Testimonies of Recovery</i>.</p>  
 <p>The ☽ applying to a fortune, powerful, denotes that the party will be restored to his former health. If reception be between the lords of the ascendant and 8th by house or triplicity, the fortunes assisting the degree ascending, or that on the 6th, or the ☽ by ☌, ✶, or △, the sick will perfectly recover. The lord of the ascendant, being a benefit planet, or any fortune in an angle and no ill aspects cast thereto, signifies health. A certain sign of recovery is, when ☉, ♃, ♀ or ☽ be in the ascendant, and no ways afflicted by the lord of the 6th or 8th house; the more so if in the houses of the lights or benefics. The ☽ in her own house, or the houses of ♃ or ♀, and in any aspect to those benefics, and no way</p>  
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p>  
 <p>afflicted by ♅, ♄, or ♂, denotes health and life. Whenever ☽ ☌ ♃ occurs, it denotes recovery, but if in ♑, less than in any other sign. If ☽ apply to the lord of the ascendant by good aspect, and be unafflicted (by the lord of the 8th or 6th especially), recovery is promised.</p>  
 <p>When, at the first falling sick of the party, ☽ is void of course, and at her next crisis meets a ✶ or △ of ♃ or ♀ in the exact degree which forms the perfect critical aspect, the patient will undoubtedly recover, be he never so ill at time of asking the question. If at the commencement of a disease, ☉, ☽, and the lord of the ascendant, are free from ill aspects of the infortunes or lord of the 8th, there are assured hopes of life.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Arguments of Death</i>.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant and ☽ in ☌ with the lord of the 8th, without interposing aspects of fortunes.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant cadent, and the lord of the 8th in an angle, especially if the latter be an infortune. The ☽ applying to a planet in the 8th, and afflicted; and the lord of the ascendant applying to the lord of the 8th or to evil planets therein, are very dangerous. The ☽ transferring the light of the lord of the 8th to the lord of the ascendant, usually denotes death. So when the lord of the 8th is in the ascendant, the lord of the ascendant and ☽ both being afflicted; or the lord of the ascendant being in the 8th and afflicted, and ☽ also weak and in no dignity. The lord of the ascendant under the Earth, and in ill aspect to the lord of the 8th in the 8th, or if the two lords be in ☌ in the 4th house. It is a very ill sign when the lord of the ascendant is in ☌ with the lords of the 4th, 6th, 8th, or 12th.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant combust in the ascendant, or the lord of the 8th in the 10th, and the lord of the ascendant in the 4th, 6th, or 12th, and afflicted by malefics, are very evil.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 166</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> The lord of the 8th retrograde and conjoined with the ☽, or in ☐ or ☍ to her, shews death. The lord of the attendant in ♌ or ♒, and evilly affected by the lords of the 6th or 12th, shews little hopes of recovery; and his being conjoined with <i>Aldebaran</i>, <i>Antares</i>, <i>Caput</i>, <i>Algol</i>, or other violent fixed stars, is also evil. And if both lights be afflicted by ♄ in an angle, it is testimony of a tedious, long illness.</p>  
 <p>The ☽ in the 4th with ♂, or the ☉ with ♄, are testimonies of death; also the ☽ near the cusp of the ascendant in ☐ of ♂ from the 4th. The ☽ combust in the 8th, or if lady of the 6th and combust in the ascendant or 4th, the same; and especially if the lord of the 8th be afflicted.</p>  
 <p>The ☌ of ☽ with ☉ is a very ill sign, especially when she has not yet passed ☉; however, when the ☌ is in ♈ or ♌ it is not quite so evil. <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>In all cases the multiplicity of testimonies must be observed, the strength of the afflicting planets, and the absence of assistance to neutralize the evil influence, before you predict death.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>To know whether the Querent be really ill or not</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the ascendant be not afflicted, nor its lord out of all his essential dignities, nor afflicted by ♄, ♂, or the lord of the 6th, he is not. Or if no planet afflict the 6th house by its presence, or the ☽ be not afflicted in the 8th or 12th, or if you find ♃, or ♀, or ☊ in the ascendant, or ☉ in the 6th, or the ☽ and lord of the ascendant in good aspect, or ♃ or ♀ casting a ✶ or △ to the cusp of the ascendant or 6th, the party is not really sick, but at the utmost some slight indisposition has occurred, which will shortly be rectified.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Disease be in the Body or Mind, or both</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the ascendant, ☉, and ☽ be all afflicted, the disease is</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 167</font></a></p>  
 <p>then through the whole body; but if the planets which dispose of ☉ and ☽, or if the lord of the ascendant, or two of them, be afflicted, the disease is more in the mind. If the ascendant the ☽, and lord of the ☉ are all, or two of them, afflicted, and the lord of the ascendant and the dispositor of they free, the affection is in the mind and not in the body.</p>  
 <p>If ♄ afflict the ☽, he shews trouble in the mind, vexation and care; but if ♃ be in the planet afflicting the ☽, the contrary; for he never oppresses the mind, but always the body.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the house in which ☽ is, and the lord of the ascendant are afflicted by ☉, or combust, or under the beams of ☉, the distemper is bodily. But if the ruler of ☽ and the ruler of the lord of the ascendant be <i>much</i> afflicted, the grief is more mental than bodily. Also if the degree ascending and that degree where ☽ is be more afflicted than the lords of those signs, the disease is more in the mind; but if the lords be more afflicted, the reverse.</p>  
 <p>When the dispositors of the lights are very much afflicted and very weak, and the degree ascending have a ☐ of mo but no ill aspect of ♄ or ♂, the person is much tormented in mind. In these cases ☉ causes the mind to be troubled by pride, self-conceit, haughtiness, &amp;c. ♀ argues luxury, or a lasciviousness which disturbs both body and mind. ☿ shews foolish fancies and fearful imaginations.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Crises, or of Critical Days</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the disease be not chronic, you will find great alteration in the patient near those times when ☽ arrives at a distance from her first place, when the patient was taken ill, of 45, 90, or 135 degrees. To learn whether these <i>crises</i> will be good or evil, see how she is aspected at those times. If she</p>  
 <p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 168</font></a></p>  
 <p>be in good aspect with a benevolent planet, it promises ease and an improved condition; but if she there meet with evil aspects of malevolent planets or the lords of the 6th or 8th, he will be worse, and the medicines do little good. I have always observed that, when the ☽ came at the <i>crises</i> to ☌, ☐, or ☍ of that planet which did afflict the ascendant, ☽, or lord of the ascendant, or when she came to such aspect of the lord of the 6th or planets placed in the 6th, the patient suffered much, the disease ran high, and medicines given about that time worked little or no good. When she came, however, to ✶ or △ of the lords of the ascendant, 9th, 10th, or 11th houses, I observed some interval of ease or amendment. So when the lord of the ascendant came to any good aspect of the ☉ (if he had not power or dominion in the disease), I found the patient's <i>mind</i> much relieved.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>How long it may be before Recovery</i>.</p>  
 <p>When there is reason to believe that, by God's blessing, the sick person shall recover, and it be desired to know when, observe which planet is lord of the ascendant, and what benevolent planet he is in aspect with; then see what house they are in, (that is the one which <i>applies</i> to the other's aspect), whether angles, &amp;c., and what signs they possess, whether moveable, &amp;c. Then according to discretion and quality of the disease, so frame the measure of time. In general, I judge in so many days as the aspect wants degrees of being perfect, if the sign be moveable and the planet angular; but if swift in motion, I am the more certain that the patient will begin to amend in so many days. If the sign be common, in which the application is, I neither judge days, weeks, nor months, but use discretion, having first observed the nature of the disease.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 169</font></a></p>  
 <p>The ancient rule was as follows:</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p>Moveable   signs shew</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p><i>days.</i></p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p>Common   ditto</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p><i>weeks.</i></p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p>Fixed   ditto</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p><i>months.</i></p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p>Angles   are equivalent to</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p><i>moveable signs.</i></p>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p>Succeedent   houses to</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">

 <p>Cadent   houses to</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">   
 <p><i>fixed signs.</i></p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  
 <p>It is well to observe, also, the quick or slow motion of the ☽, the sign she is in, and her situation as to angles, &amp;c. I often find that when the lord of the ascendant quits the sign he is in, and enters a sign in which he has dignities, the patient recovers at that time, or feels an alteration for the better. If a common sign be on the 6th, 28° or more, I say, that the disease will vary in two weeks.</p>  
 <p align="center">JUDGMENT OF THE DISEASE FROM THE AFFLICTION OF THE MOON AT THE FIRST ILLNESS OF THE PATIENT, OR THE TIME OF ASKING THE QUESTION. <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Whoever shall be first taken ill, or compelled to take to his bed when the</i> ☽ <i>is afflicted by</i> ♄, <i>or by</i> ☿, <i>if he have the nature of ♄, will, in a great</i> <a href="errata.htm#1"><i>measure</i></a>, <i>suffer as here described</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♈, in ☌, ☐, or ☍ of ♄</i>.--Headache or heaviness in the head, much discharge at the nostrils, dulness, or weariness of the eyes, humours falling into the throat; weak pulse, and a heavy drowsiness of mind; loathing at the stomach, violent unseasonable perspiration, internal heats, and externally cold. The patient more afflicted at night than by day.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♉, in ☌, &amp;c. of ♄</i>.--Fevers proceeding from obstructions near the heart, liver, and lungs, occasioned by surfeits,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 170</font></a></p>  
 <p>high living, &amp;c. The pulse high and immoderate, the body inflated, lungs oppressed, ulcerated, &amp;c. If the ☽ be not supported by benefits, there is danger of death within 14 days.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♊ in ☍ ♄, &amp;c</i>.--The disease has its origin in the mind by too much care, or a multiplicity of business, or otherwise by fatigue in travelling or over-exercise. There is danger of a small fever; the pain is dispersed over all the body, but chiefly in the joints. The vitals are afflicted, the pulse rare, and weak; there are frequent perspirations, symptoms of spleen and consumption. If ♂ also afflict, without assistance, the patient will hardly live 10 days; but if ♃ or ♀ assist, the sick person may recover after a long period.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♋ in ☌ of ♄, &amp;c</i>.--The breast is much afflicted with tough phlegm, or slimy matter; there is cough, and much salivary discharge. Hoarseness, catarrhs, &amp;c., with humours falling into the breast; the windpipe obstructed; slight fevers, agues, &amp;c. holding a long time; also pains in the bowels, infirmity in the reins or secrets. If ☽ be decreasing, and near the body of ♄, the disease will continue a long time.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♌ in ☌, &amp;c of ♄</i>.--The sickness arises from bad blood, the patient suffers with heat in the breast, heart-burn, violent fevers, troubled pulse, much external and internal heat, faintness at the heart, swoonings, the stone; and sometimes the black jaundice. If there be no good aspects to prevent it, they frequently die when ☽ comes to ☍ of ♄.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♍ in ☌, &amp;c. ♄</i>.--The illness arises from indigestion, obstructions in the bowels, &amp;c.; shooting pains are felt under the ribs, &amp;c.; flatulency, gout, or aches in the thighs or feet, &amp;c. The patient generally is sick a long time.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♎ in ☌, &amp;c. of ♄</i>.--The disease has its origin in some surfeit of wine or rich food, meat ill digested, &amp;c., or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 171</font></a></p>  
 <p>from excess of venery; the breast is affected, also he head, there is no appetite, a loathing in the stomach, cough, hoarseness, &amp;c., and often great pain in the joints, knees, and thighs, with an itching in those parts, and fear of sciatica.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♏ in ☌, &amp;c. of ♄</i>.--Denotes a disease in the <i>rectum</i> or <i>sphincter muscle</i>, piles, hemorrhoids, or fistula. There is very likely a retention of urine, or the reverse; stone in the bladder, dropsical humour, &amp;c.

 <p><i>The ☽ in ♐ in ☌, &amp;c. of ♄</i>.--The patient suffers by pains in the joints, &amp;c., or fever, extremes of heat and cold. Illness often happens by too great exertion of body or mind, and cold taken afterwards; there is much melancholy also. And if it be an ☍ of ♄, there is generally a spice of gout, tumours or swellings in the hands, thighs, or feet, &amp;c. If ♂ have any ill aspect to ☽, it proves a violent burning fever.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♑ in ☌, &amp;c. ♄</i>.--The disease proceeds from cold or melancholy. It brings heaviness of the breast and stomach, difficulty of breathing, dry coughs, the lungs oppressed, and a fever is approaching. The pain is greater at night than in the day. The patient continually complains of headache, or pain in the left ear, or of a rumbling noise in his head. <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

The malady comes on unequally with remission or intension. <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">1</font></a> The patient suffers by noise in the head, by wind, or faintness at the heart, or a rising and danger of suffocation by hysterical fits, &amp;c.; and by sore throat.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♓ in ☌, &amp;c. ♄</i>.--The complaint arises from cold, <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the patient is afflicted with continual fever, frequently sighs, suffers pains under the nipples of the breast, and about the heart; the throat suffers from much phlegm, or there is water in the chest, rotten cough, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whoever is taken ill when ☽ is afflicted by ♂ or the ☉, suffers in the following manner</i>:--</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♈ in ☌, &amp;c. of ♂</i>.--The disease is from some distemper of the membranes, &amp;c. of the brain. There is continual fever and restlessness, extreme thirst, foul tongue, or inflammation of the liver, heat and pain in the breast, high pulse, and often delirium. The patient is generally almost mad with pain, either cholic or cholera pains, &amp;c. in the bowels. If after the ☽ leave ♂ she go to ☌ or ☍ of ♄, there is small hope of life; and if she decrease in light, and be slow in motion, there is scarce any.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♉ in ☌, &amp;c. of ♂</i>.--There is an abundance of blood, continual fever, the whole frame disordered; sore throat, with inflammation in the neck, or hind part thereof; pain in the bones, broken sleep, and a foolish longing after wine and cold water. There is often putrid sore throat and also hoarseness, and strangury, stone, or gravel, with pain in the reins or kidneys, or disease therein.</p>

There is danger of consumption. The blood is over-heated, the body dry and parched; there is probability of pleurisy, fainting, and swooning. I ever fear this ☌ or ☍ more than in any other sign.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♍ in ☌, &amp;c. ♂</i>. Flux in the bowels, small fevers, a failing pulse, cholic, flatulence, weakness in the legs, or near the ancles. If ☽ be afflicted by ♂ in ♍, diseases are not easily removed.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♎ in ☌, &amp;c. ♂</i>.--The patient is grieved with plentitude of blood, and, from that cause, has high pulse, no rest, is feverish, and an inflammation all over the body.

If there be reason to believe it, some scandalous disease may be judged, especially if ♀ afflict ☽.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♐ in ☌, &amp;c. ♂</i>.--The disease is in general violent,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 174</font></a></p>  
 <p>and caused by gluttony or repletion. There is fever frequently very high, or choleric passion; but the pulse is often faint, and beats slow and feeble. Inordinate exercise has frequently been the cause of the disease; and he suffers pestilent fever, &amp;c.

 <p><i>The ☽ in ♑ in ☌, &amp;c. ♂</i>.--Nausea abounds, vomiting and flux. A puffing up of the sinews, (such as cholera cramps), inflammation of the breast, and humours in the hands or fingers.

 <p><i>The ☽ in ♒ in ☌, &amp;c. ♂</i>.--If ☽ be slow in motion, and decreasing in light, the disease proceeds from sharp and violent affections, or vehement passions. There is pain at the heart, swooning fits, high pulse, great pain in the chest, and much difficulty in breathing.</p>  
 <p><i>The ☽ in ♓ in ☌, &amp;c. ♂</i>, The body is full of gross humours, the disease is from too much drinking and excess, and is most prevalent in the night time. The party is troubled with a kind of delirium, (frequently it shews that they are yet drunk), they have vehement thirst, sharp burning fevers, and are desirous of wine. They have generally a looseness and much pain in the bowels, or a violent cough and great expectoration, and are almost suffocated with phlegm; the body is swollen, and there is danger of dropsy. <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p align="center">QUESTION. <i>A sick Doctor, what is his Disease? Is it curable?</i></p>  
 <p>To learn what part of the body is affected, observe that, as the ascendant is not afflicted, you mast look to the 6th house, and see if it be so. Therein we find ♄ in his fall; and as he naturally signifies diseases by his presence, I concluded that, from thence and that house I must require the part aggrieved.</p>  
 <p>♈ represents the head.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>♄ in ♈ shews the breast. <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>♂, lord of the ascendant, in ♌, signifies the heart. <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a> The Lord of the ascendant has just separated from a ☐ of ♄, being at that time in ♋, which signifies and rules over the breast and stomach. From all these testimonies I concluded that the parts of the body grieved were the head, breast, heart, and stomach; and that there was lodged in the breast or stomach some obstruction, which caused all his disease and suffering.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>From what Cause the Sickness was</i>.</p>  
 <p>The principal significator being ♄, and he in his own terms, and ☽ disposed of by him and applying to him, shewed such diseases as he causes, and which might exist in the head and breast. ♂, lord of the ascendant, was also in the terms of ♄, and applied to ☐ of ☉, who was in the terms of ♂. So that dry, melancholy diseases were shewn by ♄, and heat or fever by ♂. And, indeed, when I came to speak to him, he was suffering great pain and rumbling in his head, was very silent, dull, and melancholy; he slept very little, had a very dry cough, and complained of great weakness and pain in his breast and at his heart. His complexion was between black and yellow, as if inclined to jaundice; and he had also a lingering consumption and great weariness all over him, with pains in his joints, shewn by ☽ in an airy sign. The ascendant is ♏, which signifies the secrets, stone in the bladder, &amp;c.; so the ☽ in ♒ shews the secrets and diseases therein, &amp;c. Hence he had great difficulty in making water, voided red gravel, and suffered great pain in those parts.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Disease would be curable or not</i>?</p>  
 <p>The author of the disease being ♄, shewed it would be of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a></p>  
 <p>some continuance, for he is a slow ponderous planet; besides, the angles of the figure are all fixed, and the lord of the ascendant, ☉, and ☽, are all in fixed signs. The lights are in ☐ aspect to each other from angles, and both in the terms of an evil planet; and the lord of the 6th in a fixed sign: all these shewed a long disease. The ☽ being in the 4th in aspect to ♄ in the 6th, and applying to ☐ of ☉, who has dignities in the 6th, and the lord of the 4th in the 6th, and lord of the 8th in the 8th, the testimonies were strong for his death: <i>he died the 14th August following</i>.</p>

 <p align="center">QUESTION.--<i>What is the Disease? and will the Patient live or die?</i> </p>  
 <p>The ascendant is ♍, and it is afflicted by the presence of ♂, who is partly lord of the 8th house, as great part of ♈ is already therein. Hence from the ascendant chiefly we must learn the cause and nature of the disease, and part afflicted. A fixed sign ♒ is on the 6th, afflicted by ☋, and ♄, lord of the 6th, is in ♉, an earthy sign, of the same nature as ♍, the ascendant. The ☽, a general significator in all diseases, is also in ♍ in ☌ with ♂. All these shewed the patient to be greatly afflicted with the spleen, cholic, and obstructions in his bowels, small fever, flatulence, and a failing weak pulse. And as the ☽ and ♂ are in the <i>ascendant</i>, the patient was perplexed with distempers in the head, slept unquietly, &amp;c. (<i>All which was true</i>.)</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Will the Patient live or die</i>?</p>  
 <p>All the significators promised death.</p>  
 <p>1st. ☉, light of time, was in close ☐ to ♄, lord of the 6th in fixed signs.</p>  
 <p>2d. The ascendant was extremely afflicted by presence of ♂, he being lord of nearly all the 8th house.</p>  
 <p>3d. The ☽ was afflicted by ♂ in the house of life.</p>  
 <p>4th. The ☽ separated from the ✶ of ☿, lord of the ascendant, in signs of long ascension, and did transfer his light to ♃, lord of the 4th and 8th houses, denoting death and the grave.</p>  
 <p>N.B.--The patient died the 28th of the month, when ☿ came to the ☐ of ♄ and ☌ of ☉ in the figure. The ☽ came then to ☍ ☉, and had transited the cusp of the 6th house of the day preceding, viz. ♒ 14°.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_91"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_91">158:1</a> If the illness be produced by an accident, then take the time at which it occurred.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_92"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_92">159:1</a> Our author adds, "or when first the <i>urine</i> was brought to him." This makes it evident that the water doctors, as they were termed, even until a very recent period, had recourse to astrology to ascertain the nature and result of their patients' diseases. We are quite sure, from long experience, that these may be accurately learned by the science; and we believe that many medical men call it to their aid even now. The day is coming when this will be generally the case.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_93"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_93">159:2</a> In all cases where the ☽ is afflicted by either ♄ or ♂, we should regard the rules for that situation as of the chief importance; we have ever known them fail.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_94"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_94">161:1</a> For the diseases signified by the <i>signs</i>, see CHAPTER XV; and for those of the <i>planets</i>, see the nature, &amp;c. of each, at page <a href="aia08.htm#page_35">35</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_95"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_95">161:2</a> ♅ causes all uncommon and extraordinary complaints; or gives remarkable features to the sickness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_96"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_96">166:1</a> We should say, if it be in ♋, where ☽ disposes of ☉, it is not so evil.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_97"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_97">169:1</a> The student may rely that he will find these rules, when they apply, to be infallible.--ZADKIEL.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_98"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_98">171:1</a> These latter especially, if ♀ throw an ill aspect, or the lord of the 5th house.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_99"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_99">171:2</a> We can speak personally as to this effect. We were taken ill in the evening of the 1st March, 1829, when ☽ was in ♑, 19°, and ♄ in ♋ 28°, and we suffered extremely during the night, and had violent pains in the left side of the head, and sensations of noises, as of the working of the piston of a steam-engine. A fever ensued, which confined us to bed for three weeks, having caught cold after taking mercury. The direction in our nativity was M.C. ☌ ☉, who, being in ☌ with ♂ at birth, partook of his ill qualities, and afflicted the ascendant by his mundane square.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_100"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_100">172:1</a> This till ☽ is past ☍ of her own place, when, if there be good aspects the sick is recoverable.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_101"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_101">172:2</a> Especially wet feet, damp linen, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_102"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_102">174:1</a> Where various diseases are named, the student must look to other testimonies to ascertain the exact complaint.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_104">176:1</a> This will be seen by the Table at the end of this chapter.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_104"></a><a href="aia32.htm#fr_105">186:1</a> This table is taken from the old Arab writers on astrology, who flourished many centuries back: they used many terms inconsistent with the modern nomenclature of diseases; but as the human frame is still the same, so are its diseases, though called by different names. Thus, <i>Mercury in Aquarius</i> is said to cause "wind in the blood," by which, we presume, was meant spasmodic action, arising from debility.</p>
