 <h1 align="CENTER">An Introduction to Astrology</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">by William Lilly</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Zadkiel, ed.</h3>
 <h4 align="CENTER">[1852]</h4>
 <hr>
 <p>First published in 1647,
 as <cite>Christian Astrology</cite>, this is one of the best
 known post-classical works on Astrology.
 the present edition, heavily edited by 'Zadkiel,' was
 released under the current title in 1852.
 As the planet Uranus ('Hershel'), discovered in 1781,
 is mentioned throughout, and Neptune, discovered in 1846, is not,
 we can bracket the date of composition of
 the revised edition to the mid-19th century.
 </p>
 <p>
 Horary Astrology, the subject of this book, interprets planetary
 positions to answer a wide range of questions, from lost dogs and
 stolen fish, to the death of kings.
 While there is a basic repertoire of interpretations, (e.g., Saturn bad,
 Venus good), the horoscope is used as a jumping off point for the
 astrologer's intuition.</p>
 <p>
 And Lilly apparently had spectacularly good intuition.
 His famous prediction of the London fire of 1666 was so accurate
 that he was suspected of starting it, a charge he was later acquitted of.
 Lilly also used Astrology in medical practice and
 this book discusses the use of horoscopes in diagnosing diseases,
 determining whether a patient will die or get better, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
 Zadkiel was apparently the pseudonym of Richard James Morrison (1795-1874).
 Thanks to John Mark Ockerbloom of Online Books for pointing this out.
