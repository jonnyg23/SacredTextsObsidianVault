 <p align="center">♄ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ♃</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, it shews much trouble by lawyers or the clergy,</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, he is always wretched and miserable idle, unfortunate, and beggarly.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ♂</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, it is the aspect of cruelty and murder, and the person so signified is extremely unfortunate; he generally lives a most dejected life, and dies a violent death.</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, the person shewn by him is very malicious, treacherous, and blood-thirsty; one delighting in the most evil deeds, yet very cowardly, sly, and much addicted to suicide and secret revenge; of a cruel complexion: in short, such a character as Don Miguel of Portugal.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☉</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, it is the aspect of infamy and contempt; the person is prodigal, ambitious, overbearing, hating control, very disagreeable in his manners, extremely unfortunate, subject to the frowns of persons in power, and often meets a violent death.</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, the person is cowardly, spiteful, treacherous, malicious, unfeeling, covetous, repining, always despising any thing of kindness and humanity; one who generally leads a life of wretchedness, and frequently meets with a bad end, and sometimes dies in prison.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ♀</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, it shews dissipation, and the person leads a most detestable life, connected with the lowest order</p>  
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>  
 <p>of prostitutes, by whom he is eventually brought to ruin and disgrace.</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, the person is generally of an evil complexion, and not very handsome; very sly, artful, full of mischief, and much addicted to dissipation, though not suspected; mostly unfortunate.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, it indicates a thief, cheat, or swindler; a low, cunning fellow, sly, envious, treacherous, and malicious, one who is always planning some scheme to deceive his most intimate friends; generally forming a bad opinion of every one, and not at all particular as to speaking the truth.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, the person is very artful, always involved in strife and contention, and much given to vilify the character of others, by whom he is tormented with lawsuits; it also indicates pettifogging attornies, who very seldom act honestly towards their clients.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, it shews a wandering, unsettled and changeable person, not of a genteel form, but one who is down-looking, and inclined to stoop forward; always very fretful, and appearing full of trouble; not a good disposition, nor to be depended on. He seldom attains any high situation, but, if he does, he soon falls into disgrace again.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, (<i>which in some measure she always is of the</i> QUERENT), the person is extremely unfortunate, always in trouble with the lower order of mankind, from whom he receives many injuries; he is mean, cowardly, and very dejected; is rather unhealthy, seldom living a long life, and generally dying a miserable death.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ♂</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it denotes violence, ingratitude, a furious temper, and danger of death by malignant fevers.</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, it shews pride, ingratitude, insolence, and the hatred of the clergy on account of theological opinions.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☉</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it gives arrogance, prodigality, and much vanity, with a great desire to be distinguished, which is but very rarely gratified.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, the person represented wastes his property by riotous living and all kinds of extravagance.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ♀</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it shews extravagance, dissipation, and all kinds of debauchery and intemperance.</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, the person has many enemies among the clergy, and the legal profession, magistrates, &amp;c., and he is equally void of virtue and prudence.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it gives trouble, contention, perplexities, lawsuits, and, in consequence, indigence.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, the person is frequently persecuted for his singular religious opinions; his understanding is weak, and he is often involved in strife and contention.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it shews one of many words, though of poor abilities; he is weak and foolish, and, if in a public capacity, is execrated by the multitude.</p>  
 <p>If the ☽ he significator. he is injured by faithless friends</p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>and deceitful relatives: and his property is impoverished by hypocritical fanatics.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☉</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, it denotes a man of great ambition and violence; but his fortune is too evil to allow him to succeed.</p>  
 <p>If the ☉ be significator, he is restrained by no principle of honour or gratitude; his affairs are always deranged, and he makes use of the most violent means to retrieve them. Such a one frequently becomes a footpad, murderer, or house-weaker, and is either killed in some contest, or falls a victim to the laws of his country.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ♀</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, these aspects cause lust, excess, prodigality, disease, and injury by loose women, and complete waste of fortune.</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, he is very treacherous, mischievous, base, and inconstant; or if it be a female, she is a prostitute, or very shameless.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, it shews one of some ability, but his talents are applied to the most dishonourable purposes.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, it denotes a thief or assassin; one whose most solemn protestations are not to be believed; who will desert his benefactors at their utmost need: he is violent, furious, contentious, and despised by every one for his in-famous life.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, the querent described by him is a fit companion for the lowest and most unprincipled of mankind; he is very unfortunate, and is probably a wandering vagabond, who travels over the earth without a friend or a home.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, he is excessively abusive, malicious, and treacherous. He may travel into foreign countries as a sailor or soldier, amidst innumerable dangers and hardships, and die by pestilence, dysentery, or the sword.</p>  
 <p align="center">☉ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☽</p>  
 <p>If the ☉ be significator, the person suffers losses, trouble, and much anxiety.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, he is obstinate and quarrelsome; he is exceedingly ambitious and prodigal; and is sometimes marked in the face, or his eyes are affected: the latter is especially the case if ☉ be afflicted by ♂, or either ☉ or ☽ are with the <i>nebulous</i> stars.</p>  
 <p align="center">♀ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, it shews a changeable, unsettled life, great troubles in marriage, and much ill-fortune.</p>  
 <p>If the ☽ be significator, it shews a dissolute, extravagant life, attended with indigence and poverty, and much trouble from females.</p>  
 <p align="center">☿ ☐ <i>or</i> ☍ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ☿ significator, it no doubt gives some abilities, but such persons are too unsettled to apply very closely to any subject; they are continually shifting their situations, (especially if ☿ be in a moveable sign), nor are they very sincere in their professions of friendship, nor very scrupulous in the method by which they may attain their ends.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, they have a defect in their utterance, have but little ability, except a kind of low cunning, which they apply to dishonest purposes. But as ☿ is acted on by every planet having an aspect to him, it will be necessary to observe each aspect, and allow for its influence; for if ☿ have a △ of ♃, the ☐ of ☿ to ☽ will not be near se evil, though</p>  
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p>the person will be far from sensible, notwithstanding that they are tolerably honest and well-meaning.</p>  
 <p>OBSERVATION.--The student must always remember, that the true character and condition of the person signified can only be correctly learned by noticing all the aspects the significator may receive, as well as observing the nature of the sign and house it is in, and the degree of strength or weakness it possesses, as well as those planets which aspect it. Thus, if the significator be ♂, and he receive the ☍ of ☉, yet if ☉ be weak, and ♂ have also a △ of ♃, this benefic planet being strong, he may judge that the querent will suffer by the evil influence of ☉, by receiving a severe wound in a duel, or in honourable warfare; whereas if, instead of the △ of ♃, the ☐ of ☿ occurred, there would be little doubt that he would be killed by police officers, or die by the hand of the public executioner--the latter especially. if ☉ was in the 10th house.</p>
