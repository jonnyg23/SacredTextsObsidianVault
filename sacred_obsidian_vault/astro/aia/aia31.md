 <p align="center"><i>If one shall have Children, yea or nay</i>?</p>  
 <p>HEREIN generally consider whether the signs ascending and on the 5th house be fruitful; <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">1</font></a> whether the lord of the ascendant, or the ☽ be in aspect with the lord of the 5th, and if so, whether the lord of the 5th be strong, and also the planet or planets in the 5th or in aspect with its lord. These are signs the querent shall have children before they die. Also if the lord of the 5th be in the ascendant, or the lord of the ascendant be in the 5th, it is a strong argument of children. If there be translation of light or collection between the significators, you may still judge that there will be children, but not so speedily as if it had been foreseen by the former manner of judgment.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>If a Woman ask, whether she may have a Child</i>?</p>  
 <p>If a married woman ask, consider whether the lord of the ascendant be in the 5th or 7th, or the lord of the 5th be in the ascendant or 7th, or lord of the 7th in the 5th, or the ☽ with him, or good planets in the ascendant, or with the lord of the 5th or in the angles; she may then conceive. But if none of these testimonies concur, and you find barren signs and planets in the aforesaid situations, (especially if infortunes be angular and fortunes cadent), she neither has conceived at present nor will hereafter. If good and evil planets be mixed, she may have children, but they will not live. If ♊, ♌, or ♍, be on the ascendant or 5th, and ♅, ♄, ♂, or ☉ in the 5th, it is a strong sign of barrenness. But ☉ rather causes the death of children than prevents their birth.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Man shall have Children by his Wife, or his intended Wife? Or, whether a Woman may by her Husband, &amp;c</i>.</p>  
 <p>Observe the ascendant, its lord, and the ☽; and if the lord of the ascendant or ☽ be joined to the lord of the 5th, they shall have issue by the party inquired of. If this be not, observe whether <i>translation</i> or <i>collection</i> of light occur between the significators, or whether ☽ or lord of the ascendant be in the 5th, or the lord of the 5th in the ascendant. These are all testimonies in the affirmative. If ♃ or ♀ be in the 5th no way afflicted, a child will be very speedily born; and if they, or either of them, be in the ascendant or 11th, there will be children, but not so speedily. But if the fortunes be afflicted while in those places, there is danger of the child being born dead, or dying shortly after birth. If there be signs of children, yet ♀ be afflicted by ♄ or ♂, there is danger of some accident, &amp;c. to the mother before the birth.</p>  
 <p>If ♄, or ♂, or ☋, (and ♅, if afflicted), be in the 5th, or the two former cast their ☍ to its cusp, the woman is not with child, nor will be. The ☐ of the infortunes to the cusp of the 5th denotes no conception, unless they be strong and there be other good testimonies. The lord of the 5th, weak, &amp;c., denotes a sickly child.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Woman be with Child or not? if she ask the Question</i>.</p>  
 <p>She is so, if the lord of the ascendant, or ☽, behold the lord of the 5th by any aspect, or translation of light have passed between them. If the lord of the ascendant, or ☽ be in the 5th, free from affliction by the infortunes, or lords of the 6th, 8th, or 12th, or ☋. If ♃ be in the 1st, 5th, 7th or 11th, not in aspect to ♄, or ♂, and they slow in motion,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>  
 <p>or retrograde. If the lord of the ascendant, or 5th be in good aspect to a planet in an angle, with mutual reception. If the ☽ be in reception with any planet in an angle, and be essentially fortified. If the lord of the ascendant behold its cusp by good aspect, out of a good house; or if ☽ be in the 7th, and behold the lord of the 7th in the 11th; or if ☽ be in the 11th, and behold the lord of the 7th in the 7th. If the lord of the ascendant be in mutual reception by house, triplicity, exaltation, or term, with a planet who has the same reception exactly; that is, if each be in the other's house, &amp;c. If the ☽ apply to the lord of the ascendant, or lord of the 5th, by good aspect from the 10th house, or by evil aspect if with mutual reception. If the sign ascending be fixed, and a fortune therein, or if the lord of the 5th be strong in the ascendant, or 10th, you may ever predict true conception.</p>  
 <p><i>She is not so</i>, if you find none of the above testimonies, or barren signs on the 5th, or ascendant; or evil planets there, or afflicting their lords and the ☽.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>If the Man ask the Question, unknown to the Woman</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>She is with child</i>, if the lord of the 5th behold a planet in an angle, with reception; or if the lords of the ascendant, or 5th, or 7th, or ♃, ♀, ☉, ☽, ☿, or ☋, be in the 5th, and be fortunate.--N.B. ☿ if in aspect to a malefic, and not in any aspect to a benefit, cannot be relied upon.</p>  
 <p><i>She is not with child</i>, if ♃ or ♀ be afflicted. If ♀ be joined to ♄ or ♂, (or to if he be ill aspected), and they be combust, retrograde, or in ♌, ♍, or ♑. If ♄ or ♂ be in the 5th, in ☐, or ☍, to its lord, they denote no conception; out if other testimonies be more powerful, and denote conception, they shew danger of abortion.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant joined to a retrograde planet, or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p>  
 <p>to one in a cadent house, or received by a retrograde or combust planet, or if no aspect or translation of light be between the lords of the 1st and 5th, are all signs of no conception; but judge by the majority of testimonies.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Is the Child Male or Female</i>?</p>  
 <p>The lords of the ascendant, the 5th, and the ☽, and the signs on the ascendant and 5th being masculine, denote a male; if they be, on the contrary, feminine, the child will be a female.--N.B. Unless this be a part of the question, do not attempt to give a judgment; nor then either, unless there be a great majority of testimonies on one or the other side. The sign the dispositor of the ☽ is in may also be considered.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Child shall live or die</i>?</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 5th retrograde, combust, or cadent, or being in his fall or detriment, and afflicted by the lord of the 8th of the figure, or the 8th from the 5th, (which is the 12th), are signs of death. Or if the lord of the 5th, being weak, be afflicted by an evil planet in the 8th or 12th, unless some opposite testimonies occur, it may be expected the child will speedily die. If the lord of the ascendant be in the 5th, and be afflicted as above, or if ♅, ♄, ♂, or ☋, be in the 5th, especially if retrograde, they denote the same.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether there shall be twins</i>?</p>  
 <p>If suspicion be of twins, and you find, upon that question, the ascending sign be double-bodied, and a fortune therein, or the same of the 5th house, and ☉ and ☽ be in double-bodied signs, and the lords of the ascendant and 5th be the same, you may judge twins. But unless all, or nearly all, these testimonies concur, it is not safe so to judge.--N.B. The dispositor of the ☽, that is the planet in whose house</p>  
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>  
 <p>she is, may also be considered. Moreover, if the ☊ be with either ♃, ♀, or the ☽, or that all these be in either ♊, ♍, ♐, or ♓, it is a farther testimony of the woman bearing twins.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>How long the Woman has been pregnant</i>?</p>  
 <p>Observe the lord of the ascendant, the 5th, or the ☽; see which is nearest from any aspect which is past, and then judge according to the nature of the aspect. If the separation be from a △, say she is in the 5th month of her conception, or the 3d; if it be a ✶, she is in the 2d or 6th month; if a ☐, she is in the 4th month; an ☍, gives the 7th month; and if it be a ☌, then she has been pregnant only one month.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Time when the Birth shall take place</i>?</p>  
 <p>Observe when a ♂ or ☉ are in ☌ with the lord of the 5th, or there be a ☌ of the lord of the 5th with the lord of the ascendant in the 5th house; about that time the birth may be expected. Observe, also, when the lord of the ascendant goes out of one sign into another; that is also a probable period for the birth. See, also, how far the lord of the 5th is from the cusp of the 5th, and give to every sign one month. Judge according to the majority of these testimonies. <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">OF AMBASSADORS OR MESSENGERS.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 5th and the ☽ may be considered to represent the ambassador or messenger. The planet to whom</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a></p>  
 <p>either of them apply shall shew the cause and nature of the message.</p>  
 <p>If you find the application be from a fortune by ☐, ☍, or ☌, and there be reception between them, or collection or translation, and that planet be in the 10th, or lord thereof, the embassy is on some high and important matter of a political nature. If the planet who is received, or translates, or collects, be lord of the 11th, he comes to renew leagues of friendship. If the lord of the 5th be afflicted or weak in the 7th, and the lord of the ascendant and he be in evil aspect, and ♂ aspect either of them evilly, there is no sign of any peace or permanent benefit arising from this embassy or message. According as the lord of the 5th and ☽ be well affected to the ascendant, its lord, and planets therein, you may predict advantage to the querent or his nation, according as it be respecting a public or private matter.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of a Message sent for Money</i>.</p>  
 <p>The message is shewn by the ☽, the messenger by the lord of the 5th: the other significators as usual.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 5th separate from the lord of the 7th, and apply to the lord of the ascendant, you may judge the messenger has effected the thing he went for, and is returning home. If the lord of the 5th separate from the lord of the 2d, he brings money. The answer the messenger brings is of the nature of that house from whose lord the lord of the 5th separates, and also of the nature of the planet himself. Therefore, if he separate from a good planet, it gives hopes of a good answer; the contrary, when he separates from evil planets. If the lord of the 5th apply by ☐, or ☍, to an infortune, before he is separated from the lord of the 7th, the messenger has had some impediment in effecting his business by the party to whom he was sent, and has also sustained</p>  
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p>  
 <p>some hinderance on his journey before he arrived at the place. But if this application to an infortune happen <i>after</i> the lord of the 5th was separated from the lord of the 7th, the messenger will have delays and misfortunes on his return. If you find an infortune (especially ♂) in the 9th, he will hardly travel safe for thieves; but if a fortune be there, his going and returning will be safe.</p>  
 <p>If there be reception, (though they apply by ☐ or ☍) between the lords of the 5th and 7th, the messenger will be well received; but the evil aspect shews some delay or excuse framed by the party to whom the messenger is sent.</p>  
 <p>As to the messenger's return; when the lord of the 5th comes to a ✶ or △ of the lord of the ascendant, that day, or near it, the messenger is heard of; or when ☽ separates from the lord of the 5th, and applies to the lord of the ascendant, the querent shall have intelligence of his messenger. The application of the <i>significator</i> to a ponderous planet shews more certainly the day. Use discretion in judging the nature of the journey, its length, &amp;c. And, according to the nature of the signs and houses in which the applying planet may be found, expect the return to be in days, weeks, months, &amp;c.</p>

 <p align="center">QUERY.--<i>If the Person asking the Question should ever have Children</i>?</p>  
 <p align="center">_________________________________</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Judgment upon the preceding Figure</i>.</p>  
 <p>The ascendant is here ♍, a barren sign; the sign of the 5th is ♑, an indifferent sign in this question, but rather barren, as being the house of l2 . The lord of the 5th, ♄, is retrograde in ♐; and the lord of the ascendant, ♀, is in ♊, both signs more barren than fruitful. The ☽ is in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>  
 <p>terms of ♂, and in ☐ to ♄, lord of the 5th. ☿, lord of the ascendant, is in the terms of ♄, and afflicted by ♂, and going to ☍ of ♄, who is lord of the 6th as well as 5th; also in the ascendant. All these are strong arguments of barrenness; and I therefore delivered the following judgment, viz., that the querent neither had been, nor ever would be, pregnant, being naturally barren; for finding the chief angles afflicted by malefics, it was certain that the evil which prevented her from conceiving had been long upon her, and would continue. I found no one promising testimony; so I declared, positively, that she never would have any children, according to the rules of the science.</p>  
 <p>The ☽ being in ☐ to ♄, and ☿, lord of the 1st, applying to his ☍, the querent was very sickly, afflicted with wind and choke; ☋ in the ascendant, shewed great pain in the head; and ☿ in ♊, shewed the same. <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The querent's moles, &amp;c. agreed exactly with the figure, viz. one mole close by the navel: one upon the right ancle; one towards the right knee, on the inner side of the thigh one near the member shewn by the ☽ in ♐; and one on the outside of the right arm.</p>

 <p>Finding only one degree and ten minutes between the as. pest of the ☽ and ♄, and that ☿ of and ♄, I gave for every degree one week, and so judged that, about <i>fourteen</i> weeks from the time of the question, she should be delivered.</p>  
 <p>The birth took place on the 11th July following, when a ♂ transited the degree ascending, and ☿ the ☍ of ☽, viz. ♋ 9°. The ☉ also was that day in ♋ 27° 48', the perfect ☐ to his own place in the figure, and ☽ in ☌ with ☿ in ♋. The time was thirteen weeks and four days after the question.</p>
