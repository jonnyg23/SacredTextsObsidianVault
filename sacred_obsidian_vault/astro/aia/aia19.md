 <p>IF one demand of the artist, what condition, quality, or stature the person inquired of is, then observe the sign of that house whereby he is signified, and the planet in it, the sign wherein the lord of that house is, and wherein the Moon is; mix one with another, and by the greater testimonies judge; for if the sign be humane, viz. ♊, ♍, ♒, or the first half of ♐ that ascends, and the lord of that sign, or the ☽ in any sign of the same nature, you may judge the body to be handsome, and the conditions of the party to be sociable, or very courteous,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> &amp;c. If the query be concerning a disease, and ♈ be either on the cusp of the ascendant or descending in the sixth house, you may judge he has something in his disease of the nature of ♈, but what it is, you must know by the concurrence of the other significators.</p>  
 <p>If a person has lost or missed any cattle, or any material thing, let him observe what sign the significator of the thing is in; if in ♈ and it be a beast strayed, or the like, let him see what manner of places that sign directs into, and let him repair thither to search, considering the quarter of heaven the sign signifies; if it be a piece of goods that without hands cannot be removed, then let him look into such parts of or about his house, as ♈ signifies.</p>  
 <p>If one asks concerning travel, whether such a country, city, or kingdom will be healthful or prosperous unto him, see in the figure what sign the lord of the ascendant is in: if the significator be fortunate in ♈, or if ♃ or ♀ be therein, he may safely travel or sojourn in such cities or countries as the sign ♈ represents; which you may easily perceive in the above-named catalogue. Those countries subject to the sign wherein the infortunes are posited, unless they themselves be significators, are ever unfortunate. Remember, that a gentleman inquires, usually, if he shall have his health and live jocundly in such or such a country or city; the merchant wholly aims at trade, and the increase of his stock; therefore, in the merchant's figure, you must consider the country or city subject to the sign of the second house, or where the part of fortune, or lord of the second house is, and which is most fortified, and thither let him trade. <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="aia19.htm#fr_53">68:1</a> This implies, that you must judge by the sign on the house which rules the particular subject of inquiry; as if it be, where he may gain a good wife, look to the seventh house.</p>
