 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_144"></a><a href="eog14.htm#fr_157">57:1</a> Assyrian Version. Apparently the previous tablet has ended with the short description of Erech and its architecture by Gilgamish, as a cue for the opening lines of the Twelfth Tablet. The "Architect" must be Gilgamish: and the description of seine and net <a href="errata.htm#3">passing</a> through his house, parallel to the phrase in the First Tablet, Column II, must a be a euphemism for the death of Enkidu. Gilgamish, having failed to learn the secret of eternal life is now reduced to calling up his dead friend to know the worst which he may expect. He asks what must the mourner do to avoid being haunted by the ghost: and then proceeds to do exactly the contrary in order that. Enkidu may return to haunt him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_145"></a><a href="eog14.htm#fr_158">57:2</a> Or, if it is the Architect speaking, "my dwelling."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_146"></a><a href="eog14.htm#fr_159">57:3</a> These lines are capable of two restorations: either "If thou [drawest] . . . unto . . ., then the ghosts will accompany thee to thy Temple," or "If thou [drawest] . . . unto . ., or go to the Temple." Some slight restoration can be made from I. 31.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_148"></a><a href="eog14.htm#fr_161">58:2</a> There is a little confusion in the next three or four lines, in comparison with the previous parallel text, and it may be that we should boldly emend or correct them accordingly.</p>
