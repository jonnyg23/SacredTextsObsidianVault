Then answerd Enlil boldly '</i>[<i>O Sun-god</i>]<i>, at thy behest did they slay the Heavenly Bull and Humbaba. But now shall Enkidu die.' But Enlil turnd angrily to the Sun-god: 'What dost thou them as befitting . . .? With his comrade thou settest out daily. '" But Enkidu laid himself down to rest before Gilgamish, and by the dam . . . him the ditch: 'My brother, of </i>(<i>great</i>)<i> worth is my </i>[<i>dream</i>]<i>.'" It breaks off after a few mutilated lines more</i>).</p>  
 <p>(<i>Column II entirely lost. From the Hittite it is clear that Enkidu has dreamt that the gods have taken counsel together, that Enkidu is to die, but Gilgamish remain alive. It would appear from the succeeding material that Enkidu, stricken presumably by fever, attributes all his misfortunes to the hetaera whom he loads with curses. The first part of the next fragment begins "destroy his power, weaken his strength," probably referring to Enkidu. Then says Enkidu, after three broken lines: ". . . . the hetaera . . . . who has brought </i>(<i>?</i>)<i> a curse, 'O hetaera, I will decree </i>(<i>thy</i>)<i> </i>[<i>fate</i>(<i>?</i>)]<i> for theethy woes</i>(<i>?</i>)]<i> . . . shall never end for all eternity. </i>[<i>Come</i>]<i>, I will curse thee with a bitter curse, . . . with desolation shall its curse come on thee: </i>[<i>may there never be</i>]<i> satisfaction of thy desire' and then follow the broken ends of six lines and then"'</i>[<i>May . . .</i>]<i> fall on thy house, may the . . of the street be thy dwelling, </i>[<i>may the shade of the wall be thy</i>]<i> abode, . . . for thy feet, </i>[<i>may scorching heat and thirsty smite thy strength'" The rest of the curse is badly broken, but it is exceeding probable that the following are the fragments which should be assigned here</i>).</p>
