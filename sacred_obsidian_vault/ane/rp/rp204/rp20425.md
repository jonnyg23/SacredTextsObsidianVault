 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_414"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_417">112:1</a> The name signifies "The mother is good."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_415"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_418">112:2</a> The Sun-god, the presiding deity of Sippara, where the great temple of E-Babara, or E-Parra, was dedicated to him.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_416"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_419">112:3</a> Among a literary and business-like people like the Babylonians no act was valid unless embodied in writing, and drawn up according to the legal forms. Consequently a mere verbal declaration, as in the case of Hannah, was not sufficient; it had to be accompanied by the prescribed legal document with the names of the witnesses attached to it.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_417"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_420">112:4</a> "The servant of Kin." The triad or trinity of deities worshipped at Sippara consisted of Samas, A (who, in the Semitic period, was regarded as the wife of the Sun-god), and Kin (perhaps the son of Samas and A). The reading of the last name is doubtful, and may be Khur.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_418"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_421">112:5</a> The traces of the characters given by Dr. Strassmaier show that this must be the reading (<i>sal-si anna</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_419"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_422">112:6</a> Sippara, written Sippar in the cuneiform, the Sepharvaim or "two Sipparas" of the Old Testament (2 Kings xvii. 31, etc.), is now represented by the mounds of Abu Habba and Anbar (?). It consisted of two cities, one known as "Sippara of Samas," and the other as "Sippara of Anunit."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_420"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_423">112:7</a> ’Sikhurrutû.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_421"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_424">112:8</a> We must read <i>akî</i> instead of <i>adî</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_422"></a><a href="rp20425.htm#fr_425">113:1</a> The characters are illegible here, but the fact that Ummu-dhabat appeared before the priest of Sippara shows that we must supply the name of that city.</p>
