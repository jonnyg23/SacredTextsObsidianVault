 <p align="center"><small>OBVERSE</small></p>  
 <p>1. [To] Nimmuriya the great king, the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>, [my] brother,<br> 2. my son-in-law, who loves me, and whom I love<br> 3. it is said as follows: Tusratta, the great king, thy father in law</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. who loves thee, the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mittanni</span>, thy brother.<br> 5. Unto myself (is) peace; unto thee may there be peace, to thy house,<br> 6. to my sister, <a name="fr_339"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">1</font></a> and to the rest of thy wives, to thy sons,<br> 7. to thy chariots, to thy horses, to thy noble(s),<br> 8. to thy country and to thy property may there be abundant peace!</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>9. Until the time of thy fathers, they with my fathers were in closest<br> 10. alliance; <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">2</font></a> since then thou hast perfected <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">3</font></a> (it), and with my father<br> 11. wert in exceedingly close alliance.<br> 12. Now thou, since (thou) and I love one another,<br> 13. hast established (it) ten times more than in my father's time.<br> 14. May the gods direct them, <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">4</font></a> and this our alliance<br> 15. may <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rimmon</span> <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">5</font></a> my lord and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amanum</span> <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">6</font></a> for ever as now<br> 16, <i>confirm</i> (?).</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>17. And when my brother sent Manê his ambassador,<br> 18. saying: O my brother, let thy daughter be my wife<br> 19. and mistress of the land of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Egypt</span>, I did not vex the heart <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">7</font></a><br> 20. of my brother and spoke publicly according to (his) wish, <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">8</font></a><br> 21. and her whom my brother asked for I showed to Manê,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>22. and he saw her. When he had seen her he much approved <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">1</font></a> of her;<br> 23. and in peace in the country of my brother may I know her:<br> 24. may <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Istar</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amanum</span> according to the heart of my brother advise her!</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>25. Giliya my messenger reported unto me the words of my brother.<br> 26. When I heard (them) it was very good, I rejoiced very<br> 27. exceedingly saying: Verily unto me has this favour happened, <a name="fr_348"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">2</font></a> and<br> 28. whereas in consequence of the alliance that (was) between us we loved (each other),<br> 29. now in consequence of these words we shall love (each other) for ever.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>30. When I had sent to my brother and had said thus: As for me,<br> 31. very exceedingly do we love (each other) and in alliance<br> 32. we have been friendly; then to my brother I said thus: My brother<br> 33. has honoured me ten times above my father!</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>34. And I asked much gold of my brother saying: Above my father<br> 35. may my brother set me and may my brother send (it) to me.<br> 36. And to my father didst thou send much gold;<br> 37. an oblation-dish of solid gold and a cup <a name="fr_349"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">3</font></a> of solid gold didst thou send to him;<br> 38. a brick of gold like molten bronze didst thou send to me.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>39. I sent Giliya on an embassy to my brother and [much] gold<br> 40. I asked for saying: As for me may my brother<br> 41. above my father honour me, and much gold<br> 42. which cannot be counted may he send me,</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>REVERSE</small></p>  
 <p>1. may my brother send me more than to my father.<br> 2. And then I said thus to my brother: Thy standard,<br> 3. which my grandfather made saying: As for me, that<br> 4. it may last I have <i>painted</i> the work <i>red</i> (?), I have constructed (it) again for thee;<br> 5. and thereupon I further said: The gold which my brother will send<br> 6. let him send for the dowry.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>7. Again my brother sends gold (and) I say thus:<br> 8. The amount is much, <a name="fr_350"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">1</font></a> for the supply of the amount is much; and unto the (fitting) quantity<br> 9. it reaches, for thus it reaches exactly unto the (fitting) quantity;<br> 10. and on this account I have rejoiced greatly, and for all<br> 11. that my brother has sent for this I have rejoiced exceedingly.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>12. Now again I send to my brother, and may my brother<br> 13. grant me friendship above what (he granted) to my father. Now<br> 14. have I asked gold of my brother, and the gold which of my brother<br> 15. I have asked, has twice been asked for, <a name="fr_351"></a><a href="#fn_350"><font size="1">2</font></a> once<br> 16. because of thy standard and a second time for the dowry.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>17. And, O my brother, gold in good earnest which cannot be counted</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. may my brother send unto me, and may my brother send more gold than (he sent) my father,<br> 19. since in the midst of the country of my brother gold is as plentiful as dust.<br> 20. May the gods reveal <a name="fr_352"></a><a href="#fn_351"><font size="1">1</font></a> it, and as at present in the country<br> 21. of my brother gold is plentiful, so ten times more than at present<br> 22. may he extract gold; and may the gold, which I have asked for, in the heart of my brother<br> 23. not cause vexation, and O my loved one, my heart let not my brother<br> 24. vex, but let my brother the gold which cannot be counted<br> 25. in good earnest send unto me!<br> 26. And whatsoever my brother desires let him send for to the house where it is, and<br> 27. let (the messenger) go and I will give the present which my brother has asked for.<br> 28. This country (is) my brother's country, and this house (is) my brother's house.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>29. Now I send my ambassador Giliya to my brother, and let my brother<br> 30. not detain him. Let him dismiss him with a costly present, and let him go.<br> 31. May I rejoice very exceedingly when I hear of my brother's present;<br> 32. may I hear for ever of my brother's present.<br> 33. And as for this letter <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_352"><font size="1">2</font></a> which we have sent may <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rimmon</span> <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">3</font></a> my lord<br> 34. and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amanum</span> <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">4</font></a> direct them, <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">5</font></a> and unto their destination<br> 35. may they attain, and as (things are) at present so may they continue with them.</p>

 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. As at present we love (one another), so, as at present,<br> 37. for ever may we love (one another)!</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>38. Now for a present to my brother, one goblet of gold set with crystals<br> 39. (around) its cup; one heavy necklace of 20 crystal beads, and 19 (beads) of gold,<br> 40. in its centre a crystal (amulet) encased in gold; one heavy necklace of 42 <i>khulalu</i> stones<br> 41. (and) 40 gold beads, the metal of which (is) … of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Istar</span>, (in) its centre an (amulet) of <i>khulalu</i> stone cased in gold;<br> 42. 10 pairs of horses; 10 chariots of wood, together with their furniture;<br> 43. and 30 eunuchs I have sent for a present to my brother.</p>
