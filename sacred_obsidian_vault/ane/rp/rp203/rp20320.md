 <p>1. [To Napkhûri]ya my son-in-law whom I love and who loves [me],<br> 2. [Dusratta], the great king, [the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mita</span>]<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nni</span>, thy brother, thy father-in-law, who loves thee: unto me (is) peace;<br> 3.

[to] thy [country], and to thy property may there be exceeding peace!</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>6. [I sent an embassy?] to Nimmuriya, and thy father sent to me …<br> 7. [and as regards] the message which he sent, there was no word whatsoever which [was concealed from?]<br> 8. [the ambassadors] of thy father whom he sent [to] me; and Teie the chief wife of thy father,<br> 9. thy mother, [knew?] them all; he <i>showed</i> (?) them to Teie and <i>favoured</i> (?) all of them, and <i>after</i> (?) them<br> 10. thy father [repeated?] the words which he had spoken with me.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>11. … exceedingly, and [the words which I spoke] with Nimmuriya thy father whom we love,<br> 12. [and the words which] Nimmuriya thy father spoke with me, he (and) I, my heart in nothing<br> 13. did they vex, and all the words which I spoke those also on that day<br> 14. did not vex the heart of [thy father, my] beloved one, in anything, and all that<br> 15. [I said] these also did he perform on that day.</p>

 <p>16. [Now Manakhbia <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">1</font></a>] the father of [N]immuriya sent to Artatâma the father of my father, and the daughter [of]<br> 17. [Artatâma, the father] of my father he asked for; 5 times, 6 times he sends, but (Artatâma) did not give her; at last<br> 18. [his daughter] he sends and with a train (of handmaids) he gave her. An embassy from Nimmûriya thy father to Sut[tarna <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">2</font></a>]<br> 19. [my father came], and the daughter of my father, my darling sister, though he asked for her and seven times [requested her],<br> 20. [my father did not give.] At last five times and six times he sends and (my father) gave [her] with a train (of handmaids).<br> 21. [When] Nimmûriya [thy father] sent to me and when he asked for my daughter, I did not [refuse],<br> 22. [but] I spoke favourably; to his messenger I speak as follows: "I am ready to give her; thy messenger among [my] children<br> 23. has come, and [my] eyes [have seen] the <i>aqqâti</i> which he has given, and her dowry is worthy of yourself, <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">3</font></a> and I will bestow [on her]<br> 24. the dowry due to Nimmûriya thy [father] which [contains] <i>jewels</i> (?) [such as] no god possesses; and because I am honoured <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">4</font></a> I do not. [refuse]<br> 25. to give her;" and Amasis <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">5</font></a> [the ambassador] of my brother, [who had come] for the bride, I sent (back) to Nimmûriya<br> 26. after three months, with a very costly present, and …, and four … of gold [such as] none [had given before]</p>

 <p>27. [and] a goblet … of gold was given, which I [despatched].</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>28. At last my daughter I gave [to him], and when [I had] despatched her and when Nimmûriya thy father had seen <a name="fr_330"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">1</font></a> her,<br> 29. … he rejoiced with exceeding fulness, and my brother speaks as follows: "In the joy of my heart<br> 30. I will give her [all her desire]"; and he caused her to be united publicly with his country <a name="fr_331"></a><a href="#fn_330"><font size="1">2</font></a>; and moreover my ambassador<br> 31. [he honoured?] like men … when he had seen [him], and he honoured him, and ever did Nimmûriya<br> 32. [place him] in the front rank; and since he honoured the embassy, so among the houses which [he gave] to Tadukhepa<br> 33. [my daughter, he placed] my [servants] all of them, and he made (them) dwell round about <a name="fr_332"></a><a href="#fn_331"><font size="1">3</font></a> and in the midst of my ambassadors, who entered<br> 34. [his country]. There was nothing which Giliya [my ambassador did not obtain?]: gold which he gave a thousandfold in weight<br> 35. … Nimmûriya gave to [Tadu]khêpa and Tadukhêpa<br> 36. [gave to Giliya?] whatsoever he desired, and [Giliya] my ambassador did Nimmûriya in friendship<br> 37. [exalt and] honour: then [Nimm]ûriya sent Nisag his ambassador<br> 38. [on account of Tadukhêpa] my darling sister, and along with [Nisag] he sent slaves to my presence [and] objects of gold<br> 39. …… of gold … of Giliya; and ever<br> 40. …… [Nimmûriya] returned my friendship, [and] my ambassadors<br> 41. ……… I (?) did not send to the slaves</p>

 <p>42. ……… among the slaves when he sent<br> 43. …… he did not despatch to me, and … I despatched; an <i>object</i> (?) it had not; and so<br> 44. [Nimmû]riya, thy father, in all the words [he had], one subject for vexation did not leave.<br> 45. [The words] which I speak, all of them, … and a wish I do not utter. Teie<br> 46. [knows the truth of] what I speak, and ask Teie thy [mother] if among the words which I speak<br> 47. (there is) one word of falsehood … him did Nimmûriya thy father [honour?], and<br> 48. Nimmûriya thy father made brotherhood [and league?] with me, and Nimmûriya thy father<br> 49. did [not] say: At last the gold which [thou desirest] I have forwarded <a name="fr_333"></a><a href="#fn_332"><font size="1">1</font></a> to the land of Khani-rabbat; and when I went down and<br> 50. he did not send the [gold which] I asked for, [to] future [days] it was left in the keeping of Nimmûriya<br> 51. thy [father]; and Nimmûriya said to [my] envoy: Furniture (and) objects of gold, a profusion of everything<br> 52. [which] my brother has asked for, which was left [here], which [I have agreed to give] and which my father agreed to give, I [now] send to you.<br> 53 [And] so Nimmûriya thy father never changed his word to a non-word;<br> 54. [through what] he said in words never did he cause vexation.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>55. [Now] they say that Nimmûriya has died, <a name="fr_334"></a><a href="#fn_333"><font size="1">2</font></a> and what they have said<br> 56. has distracted my heart, <a name="fr_335"></a><a href="#fn_334"><font size="1">3</font></a> and I wept on that day,<br> 57. [on my throne] I did [not] sit. <a name="fr_336"></a><a href="#fn_335"><font size="1">4</font></a> Bread and water on that day I did not [take], and I was sad,<br> 58. [and] I [said]: If he is dead, in the land of my beloved</p>

[his son will succeed him?], and he loves me; or if he is alive with the god <a name="fr_337"></a><a href="#fn_336"><font size="1">1</font></a> and …, we love<br> 60. [one another, and on] that account in our hearts we are [not] distant (from each other).</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>61. [And now to] me the eldest son of Nimmûriya by Teie his wife<br> 62. has made [offers of alliance and brotherhood] and has spoken thus: Nimmûriya is not dead<br> 63. [since Napkhururi]ya [his] eldest son by Teie his chief wife (sits) in his place and<br> 64. will never at all alter [his] words from their place (but they shall remain) as before.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>65. [Now to] my [brother] I say as follows: [Artat?]ama my brother whom we love in our hearts<br> 66. [I have sent to? Napkhûriya] the son of Nimmûriya his father [whom I] honour on account of Teie his mother, who [was chief] wife<br> 67. [of Nimmûriya] (and) loved (him) during the reign of (his) father, in order that she may <i>repeat</i> (?) the words before Napkhûriya,<br> 68. [even the words of Nimmû]riya her husband, very earnestly, whom we love.</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>69. Since [Nimmûriya] formerly sent an embassy to [me] when he dismissed Giliya, and<br> 70. [further] sent Manê [as ambassador], and my brother despatched objects of wood, and also gold<br> 71. …… [saying] that it (is) not gold and that I have not brought (it)<br> 72. …… immediately from before the king</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p>73. Nimmû[riya] my brother forthwith [despatched the object]s which my brother gave to me,<br> 74. [saying, Take it?] since I dig [the mines] very laboriously,<br> 75 and I [answer] thus: Nimmûriya my brother the presents<br> 76. despatched [to me], which Napkhûriya my brother, whom [I love], has not increased above him<br> 77. ……… and what he despatched; and since ……<br> 78. ……… and before Manê …… I was vexed<br> 79. ……………</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________</p>  
 <p>80. …… [the presents] which my brother forwarded and<br> 81. …… [I convened] my nobles, saying: With my brother in [friendship]<br> 82. [I am united, as his fathers with] my fathers in sooth and with his fathers<br> 83. [my fathers; I have received] the gifts which my brother has sent and<br> 84. …… we have rejoiced exceedingly and kept a day of festival.<br> 85. …… he fixed ourselves, and in the [time] of night thou thyself<br> .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .</p>
