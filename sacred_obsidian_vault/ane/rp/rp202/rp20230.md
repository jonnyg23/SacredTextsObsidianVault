 <p>33. I am a lion, I am a hero; Assur-natsir-pal, the powerful king, the king of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assyria</span>, named of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Moon God</span>, the favourite of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anu</span>, the beloved of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rimmon</span> mightiest among the gods,</p>  
 <p>34. (am) I; a weapon that spares not, which brings slaughter to the land of his enemies, (am) I; a king valiant in battle, the destroyer of cities and mountains,</p>  
 <p>35. the leader of the conflict, the king of the four regions (of the world), who lays the yoke upon his foes, who <i>enslaves</i> (?) all his enemies, the king of all the zones of all princes,</p>  
 <p>36. every one of them, the king who subjugates the un-submissive to him, who has overcome all the multitudes of men. This is the destiny which from the mouth of the great gods</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. has issued forth for me, and they have established (it) firmly as my destiny. According to the desire of my heart and the stretching forth of my hand <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Istar</span>, <a name="fr_340"></a><a href="#fn_338"><font size="1">1</font></a> the lady who loves</p>  
 <p>38. my high-priesthood, looked with favour upon me and set her heart to make combat and battle, and in those days Assur-natsir-pal, the exalted prince, the worshipper of the great gods,</p>  
 <p>39. whom <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bel</span> has caused to obtain the desire of his heart so that his hand conquered the lands of all princes who submitted not unto him, the conqueror</p>  
 <p>40. of his foes who in difficult places has broken through the squadrons of the mighty—at that time <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assur</span> my great lord, the proclaimer of my name,</p>  
 <p>41. the enlarger of my kingdom over the kings of the four regions (of the world), has mightily magnified my name, the weapon that spares not unto the hands of my lordship</p>  
 <p>42. he has given to hold. To effect the submission and homage of countries and mighty mountains powerfully has he urged me. In reliance on <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Assur</span> my lord</p>  
 <p>43. I traversed impassable paths (and) trackless mountains with the forces of my armies: a rival unto me existed not. At the beginning of my reign,</p>  
 <p>44. in my first year, when the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sun-god</span> the judge of the zones (of the world) had thrown his kindly shadow over me, on the throne of royalty mightily I had sat, (and) the sceptre</p>  
 <p>45. that shepherds mankind he had caused my hand to hold, I collected my chariots (and) armies. Impassable roads (and) trackless mountains, which for the passage</p>  
 <p>46. of chariots and armies were not suited, I traversed; against the land of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nimme</span> <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_339"><font size="1">2</font></a> I marched: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Libê</span> <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_340"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p>48. in numbers I slew; their spoil, their goods (and) their oxen I carried away. (Their) soldiers sought the inaccessible mountain. The inaccessible mountain they reached. With (my) forces after them</p>  
 <p>49. I marched. <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">2</font></a> The summit of the mountain was like the point of an iron blade, and the flying bird of heaven had not swooped upon it. Like a nest</p>  
 <p>50. of <i>hawks</i> (?) in the midst of the mountain they made their stronghold. Into the midst of them where none among the kings my fathers had penetrated, in three days</p>  
 <p>51. the hero beheld the mountain; against it did his heart offer opposition: he ascended the mountain on his feet; he overthrew (and) destroyed their nest; their forces</p>  
 <p>52. he shattered; 200 of their warriors he slew with weapons. Their spoil, multitudinous as a flock of sheep, I carried away.</p>  
 <p>53. With their blood I dyed the mountain like wool (?). The ravine (and) torrent of the mountain devoured <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">3</font></a> what was left of them. Their cities</p>  
 <p>54. I overthrew, dug up (and) burned with fire.

 <p>64. 260 of their fighting-men I slew with weapons; their heads I cut off (and) built into a pyramid. The rest of them like a bird</p>  
 <p>65. made (their) nest in the rocks of the mountain. Their spoil (and) their goods from the midst of the mountain I brought down. The cities which in the midst</p>  
 <p>66. of the mighty ranges were situated I overthrew, I dug up, I burned with fire. All the soldiers who had fled from the face of my weapons descended; my feet</p>

It represented the earth and the lower world, and so became synonymous with Arabi or Hades. Temples were built after the supposed likeness of this "temple of the earth," and the name consequently came to signify a "temple" in general. Uras was the messenger of Mul-lil "the lord of the ghost-world," worshipped at Nipur or Niffer, and identified by the Semites with their supreme Bel. His connection with the ghost-world or Hades explains why Uras should be called "the offspring of the temple of the earth."</p>

Whether the country of Gozan had anything to do with the city of Gozan which gave its name to Gauzanitis in classical times is doubtful. The city seems to be meant by the Gozan of Scripture (2 Kings xix. 12) which lay on the river Khabour. Khupuska lay to the north of Assyria and the Upper Zab.</p>
