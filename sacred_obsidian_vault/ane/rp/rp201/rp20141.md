 <p><b>Assyrian Grammar</b>. An Elementary Grammar and Reading-Book of the Assyrian Language, in the Cuneiform Character: containing the most complete Syllabary yet extant, and which will serve also as a Vocabulary of both Accadian and Assyrian. Second Edition, Revised and Corrected. By the Rev. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A. H. Sayce</span>, M.A., Deputy Professor of Comparative Philology, Oxford. 4to. Cloth, 7s. 6d.</p>

 <p><b>Assyrian Texts</b>. Being Extracts from the Annals of Shalmaneser II., Sennacherib, and Assur-bani-pal. With Philological Notes by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ernest A. Budge</span>, M.R.A.S., Assyrian Exhibitioner, Christ College, Cambridge. 4to. Cloth extra, 7s. 6d.</p>  
 <p><small>"Mr. Budge's book forms part of the useful series known as the 'Archaic Classics,' and consists of a reading-book intended for those who have already mastered the elements of Assyrian grammar. … The texts have been selected and edited with great care, variant readings being noted at the bottom of the page, and the explanatory notes at the end reflect much credit upon the author. They will be found very helpful by the beginner. Type and paper leave nothing to be desired. We hope that this and the other volumes of the same series will attract an increasing number of scholars to the study of Assyrian. Its close relationship to Hebrew cannot but clear up many obscure points in Hebrew philology, since words which occur but once or twice in the Old Testament are not unfrequently of common occurrence in the Assyrian texts. … In fact, it is no longer possible to deal with questions of Semitic philology without some knowledge at least of Assyrian. … But what has already been achieved in the field of Assyrian decipherment is but an earnest of what may yet be achieved in it. The harvest is abundant; the labourers alone are wanted. Let us hope that Mr. Budge's book will be, amongst others, the means of gathering them in."—<i>The Guardian</i>, August 8, 1880.</small></p>

 <p><small>"The texts of Genesis scattered throughout the twelve volumes of the Talmud have been carefully searched out and arranged in the order in which we find them in our Bibles. To each individual text is added the immediate context as found in the Talmud. After many of the texts and the direct Talmudical comments upon them, so-called Synoptical Notes are introduced. These refer to the principal subjects suggested in the text just commented upon, and any curious and interesting remark on these subjects contained in the Mishna and Gemara is appended. Careful references to the particular treatise, page and column are in all cases given."—<i>Introductory Essay</i>.</small></p>
