 <p><a name="fn_175"></a><a href="stc12.htm#fr_175">123:1</a> For the text, see <i>Cuneiform Texts</i>, part xiii, pl. 34, D.T. 41; for a previous publication, cf. Delitzsch, <i>Assyrische Lesestücke</i>, 3rd ed., p. 34 f.; and for previous translations, see George Smith, <i>The Chaldean Account of Genesis</i>, p. 76f., Zimmern in Gunkel's <i>Schöpfung und Chaos</i>, and Jensen in Schrader's <i>Keilins. Bibl.</i>, vi, p. 42 f. This fragment, which George Smith suggested might be part of the Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series, does not belong to that series; it contains the introduction or opening lines of a text, and describes the creation of two small creatures by Nin-igi-azag, "The lord of clear vision." The reference to the creation of cattle and beasts of the field is merely incidental; it occurs in the long opening sentence and indicates the period at which the two small creatures were made; see further the Introduction.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_176"></a><a href="stc12.htm#fr_176">123:2</a> It is probable, that the second section of the text also dealt with the two small creatures whose creation is described in the first paragraph.</p>
