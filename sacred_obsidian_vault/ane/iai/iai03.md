 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FALL OF ERECH</h3>
 <p>O Moon-god, <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1b</font></a> hear my cry! With thy pure light<br>
 Oh, take my spirit through that awful night<br>
 That hovers o'er the long-forgotten years,<br>
 To sing Accadia's songs and weep her tears!<br>
 'Twas thus I prayed, when lo! my spirit rose<br>
 On fleecy clouds, enwrapt in soft repose;<br>
 And I beheld beneath me nations glide<br>
 In swift succession by, in all their pride:<br>
 The earth was filled with cities of mankind,<br>
 And empires fell beneath a summer wind.<br>
 The soil and clay walked forth upon the plains<br>
 In forms of life, and every atom gains<br>
 A place in man or breathes in animals;<br>
 And flesh and blood and bones become the walls</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a></p>
 <p>Of palaces and cities, which soon fall<br>
 To unknown dust beneath some ancient wall.<br>
 All this I saw while guided by the stroke<br>
 Of unseen pinions:<br>
                        Then amid the smoke<br>
 That rose o'er burning cities, I beheld<br>
 White Khar-sak-kur-ra's <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">2</font></a> brow arise that held<br>
 The secrets of the gods--that felt the prore<br>
 Of Khasisadra's ark; I heard the roar<br>
 Of battling elements, and saw the waves<br>
 That tossed above mankind's commingled graves.<br>
 The mighty mountain as some sentinel<br>
 Stood on the plains alone; and o'er it fell<br>
 A halo, bright, divine; its summit crowned<br>
 With sunbeams, shining on the earth around<br>
 And o'er the wide expanse of plains;--below<br>
 Lay Khar-sak-kal-ama <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">3</font></a> with light aglow,<br>
 And nestling far away within my view<br>
 Stood Erech, Nipur, Marad, Eridu,<br>
 And Babylon, the tower-city old,<br>
 In her own splendor shone like burnished gold.<br>
 And lo! grand Erech in her glorious days<br>
 Lies at my feet. I see a wondrous maze<br>
 Of vistas, groups, and clustering columns round,<br>
 Within, without the palace;--from the ground<br>
 Of outer staircases, massive, grand,<br>
 Stretch to the portals where the pillars stand.<br>
 A thousand carvèd columns reaching high<br>
 To silver rafters in an azure sky,<br>
 And palaces and temples round it rise<br>
 With lofty turrets glowing to the skies,<br>
 And massive walls far spreading o'er the plains,<br>
 Here live and move Accadia's courtly trains,<br>
 And see! the <i>pit-u-dal-ti</i> <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">4</font></a> at the gates,<br>
 And <i>masari</i> <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">5</font></a> patrol and guard the streets!</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>
 <p>And yonder comes a <i>kis-ib</i>, nobleman,<br>
 With a young prince; and see! a caravan<br>
 Winds through the gates! With men the streets are filled!<br>
 And chariots, a people wise and skilled<br>
 In things terrestrial, what science, art,<br>
 Here reign! With laden ships from every mart<br>
 The docks are filled, and foreign fabrics bring<br>
 From peoples, lands, where many an empire, king,<br>
 Have lived and passed away, and naught have left<br>
 In. history or song. Dread Time hath cleft<br>
 Us far apart; their kings and kingdoms, priests<br>
 And bards are gone, and o'er them sweep the mists<br>
 Of darkness backward spreading through all time,<br>
 Their records swept away in every clime.<br>
 Those alabaster stairs let us ascend,<br>
 And through this lofty portal we will wend.<br>
 See! richest Sumir rugs amassed, subdue<br>
 The tilèd pavement with its varied hue,<br>
 Upon the turquoise ceiling sprinkled stars<br>
 Of gold and silver crescents in bright pairs!<br>
 And gold-fringed scarlet curtains grace each door,<br>
 And from the inlaid columns reach the floor:<br>
 From golden rods extending round the halls,<br>
 Bright silken hangings drape the sculptured walls.</p>
 <p>But part those scarlet hangings at the door<br>
 Of yon grand chamber! tread the antique floor!<br>
 Behold the sovereign on her throne of bronze,<br>
 While crouching at her feet a lion fawns;<br>
 The glittering court with gold and gems ablaze<br>
 With ancient splendor of the glorious days<br>
 Of Accad's sovereignty. Behold the ring<br>
 Of dancing beauties circling while they sing<br>
 With amorous forms in moving melody,<br>
 The measure keep to music's harmony.<br>
 Hear! how the music swells from silver lute<br>
 And golden-stringèd lyres and softest flute<br>
 And harps and tinkling cymbals, measured drums,<br>
 While a soft echo from the chamber comes.</p>
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>
 <p>But see! the sovereign lifts her jewelled hand,<br>
 The music ceases at the Queen's command;<br>
 And lo! two chiefs in warrior's array,<br>
 With golden helmets plumed with colors gay,<br>
 And golden shields, and silver coats of mail,<br>
 Obeisance make to her with faces pale,<br>
 Prostrate themselves before their sovereign's throne;<br>
 In silence brief remain with faces prone,<br>
 Till Ellat-gula <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">6</font></a> speaks: "My chiefs, arise!<br>
 What word have ye for me? what new surprise?<br>
 Tur-tau-u, <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">7</font></a> rising, says, "O Dannat <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">8</font></a> Queen!<br>
 Thine enemy, Khum-baba <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">9</font></a> with Rim-siu <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">10</font></a><br>
 With clanging shields, appears upon the hills,<br>
 And Elam's host the land of Sumir fills."<br>
 "Away, ye chiefs! sound loud the <i>nappa-khu</i>! <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Send to their post each warrior bar-ru!" <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 The gray embattlements rose in the light<br>
 That lingered yet from Samas' <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">3</font></a> rays, ere Night<br>
 Her sable folds had spread across the sky.<br>
 Thus Erech stood, where in her infancy<br>
 The huts of wandering Accads had been built<br>
 Of soil, and rudely roofed by woolly pelt<br>
 O'erlaid upon the shepherd's worn-out staves,<br>
 And yonder lay their fathers' unmarked graves.<br>
 Their chieftains in those early days oft meet<br>
 Upon the mountains where they Samas greet,<br>
 With their rude sacrifice upon a tree<br>
 High-raised that their sun-god may shilling see<br>
 Their offering divine; invoking pray<br>
 For aid, protection, blessing through the day.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>
 <p>Beneath these walls and palaces abode<br>
 The spirit of their country--each man trod<br>
 As if his soul to Erech's weal belonged,<br>
 And heeded not the enemy which thronged<br>
 Before the gates, that now were closed with bars<br>
 Of bronze thrice fastened.</p>
 <p>                                See the thousand cars<br>
 And chariots arrayed across the plains!<br>
 The marching hosts of Elam's armèd trains,<br>
 The archers, slingers in advance amassed,<br>
 With black battalions in the centre placed,<br>
 With chariots before them drawn in line,<br>
 Bedecked with brightest trappings iridine.,<br>
 While gorgeous plumes of Elam's horses nod<br>
 Beneath the awful sign of Elam's god.<br>
 On either side the mounted spearsmen far<br>
 Extend; and all the enginery of war<br>
 Are brought around the walls with fiercest shouts,<br>
 And from behind their shields each archer shoots.</p>
 <p>Thus Erech is besieged by her dread foes,<br>
 And she at last must feel Accadia's woes,<br>
 And feed the vanity of conquerors,<br>
 Who boast o'er victories in all their wars.<br>
 Great Subartu <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">4</font></a> has fallen by Sutu <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">5</font></a><br>
 And Kassi, <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">6</font></a> Goim <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">7</font></a> fell with Lul-lu-bu, <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">8</font></a><br>
 Thus Khar-sak-kal-a-ma <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">9</font></a> all Eridu <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">10</font></a><br>
 O'erran with Larsa's allies; Subartu<br>
 With Duran <a name="fr_32"></a><a href="#fn_32"><font size="1">1</font></a> thus was conquered by these sons<br>
 Of mighty Shem and strewn was Accad's bones<br>
 Throughout her plains, and mountains, valleys fair,<br>
 Unburied lay in many a wolf's lair.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>
 <p>Oh, where is Accad's chieftain Izdubar,<br>
 Her mightiest unrivalled prince of war?</p>
 <p>The turrets on the battlemented walls<br>
 Swarm with skilled bowmen, archers--from them falls<br>
 A cloud of wingèd missiles on their foes,<br>
 Who swift reply with shouts and twanging bows;<br>
 And now amidst the raining death appears<br>
 The scaling ladder, lined with glistening spears,<br>
 But see! the ponderous catapults now crush<br>
 The ladder, spearsmen, with their mighty rush<br>
 Of rocks and beams, nor in their fury slacked<br>
 As if a toppling wall came down intact<br>
 Upon the maddened mass of men below.<br>
 But other ladders rise, and up them flow<br>
 The tides of armèd spearsmen with their shields;<br>
 From others bowmen shoot, and each man wields,<br>
 A weapon, never yielding to his foe,<br>
 For death alone he aims with furious blow.<br>
 At last upon the wall two soldiers spring,<br>
 A score of spears their corses backward fling.<br>
 But others take their place, and man to man,<br>
 And spear to spear, and sword to sword, till ran<br>
 The walls with slippery gore; but Erech's men<br>
 Are brave and hurl them from their walls again.<br>
 And now the battering-rams with swinging power<br>
 Commence their thunders, shaking every tower;<br>
 And miners work beneath the crumbling walls,<br>
 Alas! before her foemen Erech falls.<br>
 Vain are suspended chains against the blows<br>
 Of dire assaulting engines.<br>
                                  Ho! there goes<br>
 The eastern wall with Erech's strongest tower!<br>
 And through the breach her furious foemen pour:<br>
 A wall of steel withstands the onset fierce,<br>
 But thronging Elam's spears the lines soon pierce,<br>
 A band of chosen men there fight to die,<br>
 Before their enemies disdain to fly;<br>
 The masari <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">2</font></a> within the breach thus died,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>
 <p>And with their dying shout the foe defied.<br>
 The foes swarm through the breach and o'er the walls,<br>
 And Erech in extremity loud calls<br>
 Upon the gods for aid, but prays for naught,<br>
 While Elam's soldiers, to a frenzy wrought,<br>
 Pursue and slay, and sack the city old<br>
 With fiendish shouts for blood and yellow gold.<br>
 Each man that falls the foe decapitates,<br>
 And bears the reeking death to Erech's gates.<br>
 The gates are hidden 'neath the pile of heads<br>
 That climbs above the walls, and outward spreads<br>
 A heap of ghastly plunder bathed in blood.<br>
 Beside them calm scribes of the victors stood,<br>
 And careful note the butcher's name, and check<br>
 The list; and for each head a price they make.<br>
 Thus pitiless the sword of Elam gleams<br>
 And the best blood of Erech flows in streams.<br>
 From Erech's walls some fugitives escape,<br>
 And others in Euphrates wildly leap,<br>
 And hide beneath its rushes on the bank<br>
 And many 'neath the yellow waters sank.</p>
 <p>The harper of the Queen, an agèd man,<br>
 Stands lone upon the bank, while he doth scan<br>
 The horizon with anxious, careworn face,<br>
 Lest ears profane of Elam's hated race<br>
 Should hear his strains of mournful melody:<br>
 Now leaning on his harp in memory<br>
 Enwrapt, while fitful breezes lift his locks<br>
 Of snow, he sadly kneels upon the rocks<br>
 And sighing deeply clasps his hands in woe,<br>
 While the dread past before his mind doth flow.<br>
 A score and eight of years have slowly passed<br>
 Since Rim-a-gu, with Elam's host amassed,<br>
 Kardunia's ancient capital had stormed.<br>
 The glorious walls and turrets are transformed<br>
 To a vast heap of ruins, weird, forlorn,<br>
 And Elam's spears gleam through the coming morn.<br>
 From the sad sight his eyes he turns away,</p>
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>
 <p>His soul breathes through his harp while he doth play<br>
 With bended head his agèd hands thus woke<br>
 The woes of Erech with a measured stroke:</p><dir>

 <p>O Erech! dear Erech, my beautiful home,<br>
   Accadia's pride, O bright land of the bard,<br>
 Come back to my vision, dear Erech, oh, come!<br>
   Fair land of my birth, how thy beauty is marred!<br>
 The horsemen of Elam, her spearsmen and bows,<br>
   Thy treasures have ravished, thy towers thrown down,<br>
 And Accad is fallen, trod down by her foes.<br>
   Oh, where are thy temples of ancient renown?</p>
 <p>Gone are her brave heroes beneath the red tide,<br>
   Gone are her white vessels that rode o'er the main,<br>
 No more on the river her pennon shall ride,<br>
   Gargan-na is fallen, her people are slain.<br>
 Wild asses <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">3</font></a> shall gallop across thy grand floors,<br>
   And wild bulls shall paw them and hurl the dust high<br>
 Upon the wild cattle that flee through her doors,<br>
   And doves shall continue her mournful slave's cry.</p>
 <p>Oh, where are the gods of our Erech so proud,<br>
   As flies they are swarming away from her halls,<br>
 The Sedu <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">4</font></a> of Erech are gone as a cloud,<br>
   As wild fowl are flying away from her walls.<br>
 Three years did she suffer, besieged by her foes,<br>
   Her gates were thrown down and defiled by the feet<br>
 Who brought to poor Erech her tears and her woes,<br>
   In vain to our Ishtar with prayers we entreat.</p>
 <p>To Ishtar bowed down doth our Bel thus reply,<br>
   "Come, Ishtar, my queenly one, hide all thy tears,<br>
 Our hero, Tar-u-man-i izzu Sar-ri, <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">5</font></a><br>
   In Kipur is fortified with his strong spears.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p></dir>

 <p>The hope of Kardunia, <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">6</font></a> land of my delight,<br>
   Shall come to thy rescue, upheld by my hands,<br>
 Deliverer of peoples, whose heart is aright,<br>
   Protector of temples, shall lead his brave bands.</p>
 <p>Awake then, brave Accad, to welcome the day!<br>
   Behold thy bright banners yet flaming on high,<br>
 Triumphant are streaming on land and the sea!<br>
   Arise, then, O Accad! behold the Sami! <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">7</font></a><br>
 Arranged in their glory the mighty gods come<br>
