 <h3 align="CENTER">CORONATION OF IZDUBAR AS KING OF THE FOUR RACES, AND APPEARANCE OF ISHTAR IN HIS ROYAL PRESENCE, WHO SUES FOR HIS HAND</h3>
 <p>To Erech's palaces returns the Sar,<br>
 Rich laden with Khumbaba's spoils of war.<br>
 The land of Ur with grandest glories shines--<br>
 And gleams with palaces and towers and shrines.<br>
 The plain with temples, cities, walls is filled,<br>
 And wide canals, and yellow harvests tilled.<br>
 Grand Erech to the sight presents no walls<br>
 In ruins laid, but glows with turrets, halls;<br>
 With splendor proudly shines across the plain.<br>
 And now with joy he meets his courtly train;<br>
 Their shouts of welcome rend the gleaming skies,<br>
 And happiness beams from his people's eyes.<br>
 Within the walls he rides with kingly pride,<br>
 And all his chiefs and seers beside him ride;<br>
 To his grand palace they now lead the way,<br>
 To crown him king of Subartu this day.</p>
 <p>Arrayed in splendor on his throne, the Sar<br>
 Before him eyes the Kassite spoils of war,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>
 <p>Khumbaba's crown of gold, and blazing gems,<br>
 The richest of the Kassite diadems,<br>
 The royal sceptre of all Subartu,<br>
 Of Larsa, Ur, Kardunia and Sutu<br>
 The Sar upon his brow the crown now bound,<br>
 Receives the sceptre while his courts resound<br>
 With shouts for Sar-dan-nu of Subartu,<br>
 The Sar of Kip-rat arba <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_207"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Sutu,<br>
 Of Sumir, Accad, Nipur, Bar-ili, <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_208"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 And Erech, Larsa, Mairu, and Kus-si,<br>
 Of Mal-al-nak, Kitu;--the sky resounds--<br>
 For Iz-zu-bar-ili, <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">3</font></a> from earth rebounds;<br>
 For Nam-mu-rabi, Bar-bels king of fire.<br>
 What king to his great glory can aspire?</p>
 <p>The Zig-gur-at-u to the skies<br>
 His hands have built, where holy fires<br>
 To Samas burn; its flame ne'er dies,<br>
 To holiness lead man's desires.<br>
 He opens wide the fiery gates<br>
 Of all the gods at Dintir old,<br>
 Ka-ding-ir-a. <a name="fr_212"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">4</font></a> This day completes<br>
 His grandeur--may it far be told<br>
 Of our great Sar whose godly gate<br>
 Wide opens Heaven's joy for man,<br>
 Of Iz-zu-bar-ili the great,<br>
 Who rules from Khar-sak to the main.<br>
 Within the entrance to the royal rooms,<br>
 Queen Ishtar with her train in splendor comes,<br>
 Her radiant form with glistening gems ablaze,<br>
 And shining crescent with its glorious rays,<br>
 Glow with bright Heaven's unremitting flame;<br>
 Thus came the Queen of Love of godly fame.<br>
 The richest robe of gods her form enshrines,<br>
 With every charm of Heaven and earth she shines;<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p>of their wide splendors robs the farthest skies,<br>
 That she with love her hero may surprise.<br>
 Her train she robes with liveries of Heaven,<br>
 To her are all the dazzling splendors given.</p>
 <p>The glittering court is filled with chiefs and seers,<br>
 When Ishtar at the entrance now appears,<br>
 The Ner-kalli, <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">5</font></a> her heralds at the door,<br>
 As some grand sovereign from a foreign shore,<br>
 The goddess proudly enters with her train,<br>
 The spirits of the earth, and tossing main,<br>
 From mountains, rivers, woods, and running streams;<br>
 And every spirit where the sunlight gleams,<br>
 Now fill the courts and palaces and halls,<br>
 And thousands glowing bright surround the walls;<br>
 Each wafting wind brings I-gi-gi <a name="fr_214"></a><a href="#fn_212"><font size="1">6</font></a> that soar<br>
 Above An-un-na-ci from every shore,<br>
 And herald Ishtar's presence, Queen of Love,<br>
 With music through the halls, around, above.<br>
 From lyres and lutes their softest wooings bring,<br>
 As Ishtar bows before her lover king.<br>
 A halo from the goddess fills the halls,<br>
 And shines upon the dazzling jewelled walls.<br>
 The Sar and seers in wonder were amazed<br>
 At the sweet strains, and glorious light that blazed;<br>
 Transfixed in silence stood, as she now spoke,<br>
 And sweeter music through the palace woke.<br>
 Like fragrant zephyrs, warbling from retreats<br>
 Of gardens of the gods, she thus entreats<br>
 From Izdubar her welcome, or a glance<br>
 Of love; and she the Sar would thus entrance:</p>
 <p>"Thy wisdom, Sar, surpasses all mankind,<br>
 In thee, O king! no blemish do I find.<br>
 The Queen of Heaven favor seeks from thee,<br>
 I come with love, and prostrate bend the knee.<br>
 My follies past, I hope thou wilt forgive,<br>
 Alone I love thee, with thee move and live;<br>
 My heart's affections to thee, me have led,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80</font></a></p>
 <p>To woo thee to thine Ishtar's marriage bed.<br>
 O kiss me, my beloved! I adore<br>
 Thee! Hear me! I renounce the godly shore<br>
 With all its hollow splendor where as queen<br>
 I o'er the heavenly hosts, unrivaled reign<br>
 In grandest glory on my shining throne;<br>
 And yet for thee my heart here pines alone,<br>
 I cannot live without my Izdubar!<br>
 My husband's love and simple word shall far<br>
 Surpass the godly bond. O let me, king,<br>
 Rest on thy breast, and happiness will cling<br>
 To all the blissful days which shall be thine.<br>
 With glory of the skies, my love shall shine.<br>
 O Izdubar, my king! this love below<br>
 Is grander here than mortals e'er can know,<br>
 For this I leave my throne in yonder skies,<br>
 And at the feet of love thy queen now lies.<br>
 Oh, let me taste with thee the sweets of love,<br>
 And I my love for thee will grandly prove,<br>
 And thou shalt ride upon a diamond car,<br>
 Lined with pure gold; and jeweled horns of war<br>
 Shall stud it round like rays of Samas' fire.<br>
 Rich gifts whate'er my lover shall desire,<br>
 Thy word shall bring to thee, my Sar-dan-nu!<br>
 Lo! all the wealth that gods above can view,<br>
 I bring to thee with its exhaustless store.<br>
 Oh, come my love! within the halls, where more<br>
 Than I have named is found, all, all is thine;<br>
 Oh, come with me within our halls divine!<br>
 Amid the fragrant odors of the pines,<br>
 And all shrubs and flowers, vines,<br>
 Euphrates' <i>zir-ri</i> there shall sing for thee,<br>
 And dance around thy feet with <i>zi-mu-ri</i> <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">7</font></a><br>
 And kings and lords and princes I will bring<br>
 To bow to thee, beloved, glorious king!<br>
 With tribute from the mountains and the plains,<br>
 As offerings to thee. Thy flocks shall twins<br>
 Bring forth; and herds of fattened, lowing kine<br>
 Shall fast increase upon the plains divine.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p>
 <p>Thy warrior steeds shall prance with flowing manes,<br>
 Resistless with thy chariot on the plain.<br>
 Vast spoils, thy beasts of burden far shall bear,<br>
 Unrivaled then shall be my king of war;<br>
 And victory o'er all, thine eyes shall view,<br>
 And loud acclaims shall rend the bright Samu."</p>
