 <h3 align="CENTER">THE CURSE OF ISHTAR, AND REJOICING OF ERECH OVER THE VICTORY</h3>
 <p>The monarch and his seer have cleft the head<br>
 From Anu's bull prone lying on the mead.<br>
 They now command to bring it from the plain<br>
 Within the city where they view the slain.<br>
 The heart they brought to Samas' holy shrine,<br>
 Before him laid the offering divine.<br>
 Without the temple's doors the monster lays,<br>
 And Ishtar o'er the towers the bulk surveys;<br>
 She spurns the carcass, cursing thus, she cries:<br>
 "Woe! woe to Izdubar, who me defies!<br>
 My power has overthrown, my champion slain;<br>
 Accursèd Sar! most impious of men!"</p>
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p>
 <p>Heabani heard the cursing of the Queen,<br>
 And from the carcass cleft the tail in twain,<br>
 Before her laid it; to the goddess said:<br>
 "And wherefore comest thou with naught to dread?<br>
 Since I with Izdubar have conquered thee,<br>
 Thou hearest me! Before thee also see<br>
 Thine armored champion's scales! thy beast is dead,"<br>
 And Ishtar from his presence furious fled,<br>
 And to her maids the goddess loudly calls<br>
 Joy and Seduction from the palace halls;<br>
 And o'er her champion's death she mourning cries,<br>
 And flying with her maids, sped to the skies.</p>
 <p>King Izdubar his summons sends afar<br>
 To view the monster slain by Erech's Sar.<br>
 The young and old the carcass far surround,<br>
 And view its mighty bulk upon the ground.<br>
 The young men eye its horns with wild delight,<br>
 And weigh -them on the public scales in sight<br>
 Of Erech. "Thirty <i>manehs</i> weighs!" they cry;<br>
 "Of purest <i>zamat</i> stone, seems to the eye<br>
 In substance, with extremities defaced."<br>
 Six <i>gurri</i> weighed the monster's bulk undressed.<br>
 As food for Lugul-turda, their Sar's god,<br>
 The beast is severed, placed upon the wood.<br>
 Piled high upon the altar o'er the fires.<br>
 Then to Euphrates' waters each retires<br>
 To cleanse themselves for Erech's grand parade,<br>
 As Izdubar by proclamation bade.<br>
 Upon their steeds of war with Izdubar<br>
 The chiefs and warriors extend afar<br>
 With chariots, and waving banners, spears,<br>
 And Erech rings with their triumphant cheers.<br>
 Before the chariot of their great ar,<br>
 Who with his seer rides in his brazen car,<br>
 The seers a proclamation loud proclaim<br>
 And cheer their Sar and seer; and laud the name<br>
 Of their great monarch, chanting thus his praise,<br>
 While Erech's band their liveliest marches play:</p>
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88</font></a></p>
 <p>"If anyone to glory can lay claim<br>
 Among all chiefs and warriors of fame,<br>
 We Izdubar above them all proclaim<br>
 Our Izzu-Ul-bar <a name="fr_226"></a><a href="#fn_224"><font size="1">1</font></a> of undying fame.<br>
               <i>Sar gabri la isu</i>,<br>
               <i>Sar-dannu bu-mas-lu</i>! <a name="fr_227"></a><a href="#fn_225"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>He wears the diadem of Subartu,<br>
 From Bar-ili <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_226"><font size="1">3</font></a> he came to Eridu;<br>
 Our giant monarch, who of all <i>barri</i> <a name="fr_229"></a><a href="#fn_227"><font size="1">4</font></a><br>
 Can rival him, our Nin-arad <i>rabi</i>? <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">5</font></a><br>
               <i>Sar-dannu ina mati basi</i>,<br>
               <i>Sar bu-mas-la e-mu-ki, nesi</i>. <a name="fr_231"></a><a href="#fn_229"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>
 <p>Through the grand halls of Erech far resounds<br>
 The feast their Sar proclaimed through all the grounds<br>
 Of Erech's palaces; where he now meets<br>
 His heroes, seers and counsellors, and greets<br>
 Them in his crowded festal halls.<br>
 Grand banquets far are spread within the walls,<br>
 And sparkling rarest wines each freely drank,<br>
 And revels ruled the hour till Samas sank,<br>
 And shadows sweep across the joyous plain,<br>
 And Samas sleeps with Hea 'neath the main.<br>
 The jewelled lamps are lit within the halls,<br>
 And dazzling glory on the feasters falls.<br>
 The rays o'er gems and richest garments shone<br>
 Upon the lords and ladies round the throne;<br>
 While troops of dancing girls around them move<br>
 With <a href="errata.htm#0">cymbals</a>, harps and lutes, with songs of love.<br>
 Again the board glows with rich food and wines,<br>
 Now spread before them till each man reclines<br>
 Upon his couch at rest in the far night,<br>
 And swimming halls and wines pass from their sight.</p>
