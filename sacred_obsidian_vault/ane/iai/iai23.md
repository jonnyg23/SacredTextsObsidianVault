 <h3 align="CENTER">THE KING GOES FROM ISHTAR'S TEMPLE TO THE TEMPLE OF SAMAS</h3>
 <p>He rose and raised the pendant mystic charms<br>
 And kissed them, and the jewels of her arms<br>
 And ornaments upon her breast divine,<br>
 And then her crown with jewels iridine<br>
 He placed upon his brow, and it returned;<br>
 And from the shrine in reverence he turned;<br>
 To Samas' temple all the chiefs of war<br>
 And seers, <i>pa-te-si</i>, go with Izdubar.</p>
 <p>Before the fire he stands where holy burns<br>
 The flames of Samas. In a vase he turns<br>
 The crimson wine, to Samas, God, he pours<br>
 Libation, and his favor thus implores:</p>
 <p>O Samas, why hast thou established, raised<br>
 Me in thy heart?--protected? Men have praised<br>
 Thee, Holy One! my expedition bless<br>
 In thine own will, O God, I acquiesce.<br>
 I go, O Samas, on a path afar,<br>
 Against Khumbaba I declare this war;<br>
 The battle's issue thou alone dost know,<br>
 Or if success attends me where I go.<br>
 The way is long, O may thy son return<br>
 From the vast pine-tree forest, I would earn<br>
 For Erech glory and renown! Destroy<br>
 Khumbaba and his towers! he doth annoy<br>
 All nations, and is evil to thy sight.<br>
 To-morrow I will go, O send thy Light<br>
 Upon my standards, and dark Nina-zu<br>
 Keep thou away, that I may wary view<br>
 Mine enemies, and fix for me the hour<br>
 When I shall strike and crush Khumbaba's power.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>To all the gods I humbly pray<br>
 To Izdubar propitious be!</p></dir>

 <p> <a name="fr_203"></a><a href="#fn_201"><font size="1">1</font></a> <i>Assur Samas u Marduk-u,<br>
 Ana Sar bel-ni-ya lik-ru-bu</i>!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>And thus the Oracle with sweetest voice<br>
 To him replied, and made his heart rejoice:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>   "Fear not, O Izdubar,<br>
 For I am Bel, thy strength in war. <a name="fr_204"></a><a href="#fn_202"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 A heart of strength give I to thee!<br>
 To trust, we can but faithful be!<br>
     As thou hast shown to me.<br>
 The sixty gods, our strongest ones,<br>
 Will guide thy path where'er it runs;<br>
 The moon-god on thy right shall ride,<br>
 And Samas on thy left shall guide.<br>
 The sixty gods thy will commands<br>
     To crush Khumbaba's bands.<br>
 In man alone, do not confide,<br>
 Thine eyes turn to the gods,<br>
 Who rule from their abodes,<br>
 And trust in Heaven where powers abide!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>With joyous heart the Sar comes from the shrine<br>
 To bathe his brow in Samas' rays divine;<br>
 Upon the pyramid he stands and views<br>
 The scene below with its bright varied hues.<br>
 A peerless pile the temple grandly shone<br>
 With marble, gold, and silver in the sun;<br>
 In seven stages rose above the walls,<br>
 With archways vast and polished pillared halls.<br>
 A marble portico surrounds the mass<br>
 With sculptured columns, banisters of brass,<br>
 And winding stairways round the stages' side,<br>
 Grand temples piled on temples upward glide,<br>
 A mass of colors like the rainbow hues,<br>
 Thus proudly rise from breezy avenues.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72</font></a></p>
 <p>The brazen gates lead to the temple's side,<br>
 The stairs ascend and up the stages glide.<br>
 The basement painted of the darkest blue<br>
 Is passed by steps ascending till we view<br>
 From them the second stage of orange hue<br>
 And crimson third! from thence a glorious view--<br>
 A thousand turrets far beneath, is spread<br>
 O'er lofty walls, and fields, and grassy mead;<br>
 The golden harvests sweep away in sight<br>
 And orchards, vineyards, on the left and right;<br>
 Euphrates' stream as a broad silver band<br>
 Sweeps grandly through the glowing golden land,<br>
 Till like a thread of silver still in sight<br>
 It meets the Tigris gleaming in the light<br>
 That spreads along the glorious bending skies,<br>
 The brightest vault of all the emperies.</p>
 <p>Now rested from the cushioned seats we rise<br>
 And to the stairway turn again our eyes;<br>
 The fourth stage plated o'er with beaten gold<br>
 We pass, and topaz fifth till we behold<br>
 The sixth of azure blue; to seventh glide,<br>
 That glows with silvery summit where reside<br>
 The gods, within a shrine of silvery sheen<br>
 Which brightly glows, and from afar is seen.<br>
 Without the temple, burnished silver shines;<br>
 Within, pure gold and gems in rare designs.</p>
