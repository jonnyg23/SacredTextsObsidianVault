 <h3 align="CENTER">ISHTAR WEAVES A MYSTIC SPELL OVER THE KING AND SEER, AND VANISHES--THE SEER ADVISES THE KING TO SEEK THE AID OF THE IMMORTAL SEER WHO ESCAPES FROM THE FLOOD.</h3>
 <p>The goddess Ishtar wrapped in darkness waits<br>
 Until the goddess Tsil-at-tu <a name="fr_232"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">1</font></a> the gates<br>
 Of sleep has closed upon the darkened plain;<br>
 Then lightly to the palace flies the Queen.<br>
 O'er the King's couch she weaves an awful dream,<br>
 While her bright eyes upon him furious gleam.<br>
 Then o'er Heabani's couch a moment stands,<br>
 And Heaven's curtains pulls aside with hands<br>
 Of mystic power, and he a vision sees--<br>
 The gods in council;--vanishing, she flees<br>
 Without the palace like a gleam of light,<br>
 And wakes the guard around in wild affright.</p>
 <p>Next day the seer reveals to Izdubar<br>
 How all the gods a council held of war,<br>
 And gave to Anu power to punish them<br>
 For thus defying Ishtar's godly claim;<br>
 And thus the seer gave him his counsel, well<br>
 Considered, how to meet their plottings fell:</p>
 <p>"To Khasisadra go, who from the flood<br>
 Escaped when o'er the earth the waters stood<br>
 Above mankind, and covered all the ground;<br>
 He at the river's mouth may yet be found.<br>
 For his great aid, we now the seer must seek,<br>
 For Anu's fury will upon us break.<br>
 Immortal lives the seer beside the sea;<br>
 Through Hades pass, and soon the seer mayst see."</p>
 <p>Thus Izdubar replied, and him embraced:<br>
 With thee, Heabani, I my throne have graced;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p>
 <p>With thee I go, mine own companion dear,<br>
 And on the road each other we may cheer."<br>
 "The way is long, my King, and if I live,<br>
 With thee I go, but oh, thou must not grieve,<br>
 For perils great attend the way, and old<br>
 Am I: the suppleness of youth to hold<br>
 My strength I need, but it alas! is gone.<br>
 My heart is ready, but I fear, my son,<br>
 These crippled limbs which Anu's bull hath left<br>
 Of my strong vigor have thy seer bereft.<br>
 Too weak am I, for that long journey hard<br>
 To undertake; my Presence would retard<br>
 Thee,--with these wounds; nor strength have I to last<br>
 To guard my body in the mountain fast.<br>
 But if thou wilt, my strength is thine, my King!<br>
 To do thy will my agèd form shall spring<br>
 With gladness, and all perils I'll defy;<br>
 If need be, for thee will thy servant die."</p>
 <p>"Heabani, noble one! my chosen seer!<br>
 I love thee, bid thy loyal heart good cheer.<br>
 He steeds may take to ride through all the way,<br>
 With easy journeys on the road each day;<br>
 From perils I will guard thee, and defend;<br>
 To-morrow then we on our way will wend."</p>
 <p>Equipped for the long journey they appear<br>
 Next morn and leave, while Erech's people cheer<br>
 Them on their way across the glowing plain,<br>
 To perils dire they go--distress and pain.</p>
