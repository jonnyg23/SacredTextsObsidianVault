 <h3 align="CENTER">IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH MUA, AND OFFERS HER HIS HAND</h3>
 <p>"O Mua! thou bright Waters of the Dawn!<br>
 Oh, where art thou?" one cries as he doth run<br>
 Through the bright garden. See! 'tis Izdubar!<br>
 Immortal! glorious! our King of War!<br>
 And now in love is seeking Mua here.<br>
 He scarcely treads the ground as he comes near;<br>
 A glow of youth immortal on his cheek,<br>
 A form that sorrow, death, will never seek<br>
 Within these Happy Fields, his eyes with light<br>
 That Love alone may give, show his delight.</p>
 <p>A dazzling pillared vista round him shines,<br>
 Where golden columns bear the bowering shrines,<br>
 With gemmèd domes that clustering round him rise,<br>
 'Mid fruit-trees, flashing splendors to the skies.<br>
 He goes through silver grots along a zone,<br>
 And now he passes yonder blazing throne,<br>
 O'er diamond pavements, passes shining seats<br>
 Whereon the high and holy conclave meets<br>
 To rule the empires vast that spread away<br>
 To utmost bounds in all their vast array.<br>
 Around the whole expanse grand cestes spread<br>
 O'er paths sidereal unending lead.<br>
 As circling wheels within a wheel they shine,<br>
 Enveloping the Fields with light divine.<br>
 A noontide glorious of shining stars,<br>
 Where humming music rings from myriad cars,<br>
 Where pinioned multitudes their harps may tune,<br>
 And in their holy sanctity commune.</p>
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p>
 <p>And see! here Mua comes! she stops and waits<br>
 Within a <i>gesdin</i> bower beside its gates. .<br>
 Around, above her spreads a flowering vine,<br>
 And o'er a ruby fountain almandine.<br>
 And on a graven garnet table grand,<br>
 Carved cups of solid pearl and tilpe <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">1</font></a> stand.<br>
 A Zadu <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">2</font></a> reservoir stands near, which rounds<br>
 The fount wherein the fragrant nectar bounds.<br>
 The ground is strewn with pari <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">3</font></a> gems and pearls,<br>
 Wherefrom the light now softly backward hurls<br>
 Its rays o'er couches of paruti <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">4</font></a> stone,<br>
 Soft cushioned, circling in the inner zone<br>
 Beside the shining kami-sadi way, <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">5</font></a><br>
 Where nectar fountains in their splendor play.<br>
 The path leads far along Life's beauteous stream,<br>
 That ever through this World of joy doth gleam.</p>
 <p>And see! the hero comes! and now doth near<br>
 The maiden, where with Love she waits him here.<br>
 She flings a flowering garland, weaves it round<br>
 His form as he comes by! He turns around,<br>
 And she enwraps his breast and arms, and says:</p>
 <p>"Dear Izdubar! and thus my lover strays!<br>
 I'll bind thee with this fragrant chain to keep<br>
 Thee ever by my side! thy pleasant sleep<br>
 Hath kept my lover from my side too long!"</p>
 <p>"O thou sweet spirit, like a warbling song<br>
 Thy words are to my heart! I sought for thee,<br>
 And thy bright face and presence did not see;<br>
 I come to tell thee that I must return,<br>
 When from thy father all the past shall learn."</p>
 <p>"And wilt thou go from me to earth again?<br>
 No! no! dear Izdubar, I thee enchain!"</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p>
 <p>"'Tis true, my love, I must return to men;<br>
 My duty calls me to my throne again."</p>
 <p>"Dear Izdubar! my friend! my love! my heart!<br>
 I cannot let thee from my soul depart!<br>
 Thou shinest in my breast as some bright star!<br>
 And shall I let thee from me go afar?"</p>
 <p>"But Mua, we immortal are, and we<br>
 There might return; and thou on earth shalt see<br>
 The glories of my kingdom,--be my queen!<br>
 Upon a couch I'll seat thee, there to reign<br>
 With me, my beauteous queen,--beside me sit;<br>
 And kings will come to us and kiss thy feet.<br>
 With all my wealth I'll clothe thee, ever love<br>
 Thee, fairest of these glorious souls that move<br>
 Within this Happy World. My people there<br>
 Shall love us,--ever drive away all care!"</p>
 <p>When Mua heard him offer thus his hand,<br>
 She then unbinds him,--thoughtful now doth stand.</p>
