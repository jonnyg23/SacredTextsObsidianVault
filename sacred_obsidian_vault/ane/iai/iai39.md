 <h3 align="CENTER">CONTEST WITH THE DRAGONS IN THE MOUNTAINS--THE SEER IS MORTALLY WOUNDED--HIS CALM VIEW OF THE HEREAFTER</h3>
 <p> <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">1</font></a>"O Mam-mitu, thou god of fate and death!<br>
 Thou spirit of fierce hate and parting breath,<br>
 Thou banisher of joy! O ghastly Law,<br>
 That gathers countless forces in thy maw!<br>
 A phantom! curse! and oft a blessing, joy!<br>
 All Heaven and earth thy hands shall e'er employ.<br>
 With blessings come, or curses to us bring,<br>
 The god who fails not with her hovering wing;<br>
 Nor god, nor man thy coming e'er may ken,<br>
 O mystery! thy ways none can explain."</p>
 <p>If thou must come in earthquakes, fire, and flood,<br>
 Or pestilence and eftsoons cry for blood,<br>
 Thou comest oft with voice of sweetest love,<br>
 Our dearest, fondest passions, hopes, to move;<br>
 And men have worshipped thee in every form,<br>
 In fear have praised thee, sought thy feet to charm.<br>
 We reek not if you blessings, curses bring,<br>
 For men oft change thy noiseless, ghoulish wing.<br>
 And yet, thou comest, goddess Mam-mitu,<br>
 To bring with thee the feet of Nin-a-zu,<br>
 Two sister ghouls, remorseless, tearless, wan,<br>
 We fear ye not; ye <i>bu'i-du</i>, <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">2</font></a> begone!</p>
 <p>Sweet life renews itself in holy love,<br>
 Your victory is naught! Ye vainly rove<br>
 Across our pathway with yours forms inane,<br>
 For somewhere, though we die, we live again.<br>
  <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">3</font></a> The soul departed shall in glory shine,<br>
 As burnished gold its form shall glow divine,<br>
 And Samas there shall grant to us new life;<br>
 And Merodac, the eldest son, all strife<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a></p>
 <p>Shall end in peace in yonder Blest Abode,<br>
 Where happiness doth crown our glorious God.</p>
 <p> <a name="fr_248"></a><a href="#fn_245"><font size="1">4</font></a> The sacred waters there shall ever flow,<br>
 To Anat's arms shall all the righteous go;<br>
 The queen of Anu, Heaven's king, our hands<br>
 Outstretched will clasp, and through the glorious lands<br>
 Will lead us to the place of sweet delights;<br>
 The land that glows on yonder blessèd heights<br>
 Where milk and honey from bright fountains flow.<br>
 And nectar to our lips, all sorrows, woe,<br>
 Shall end in happiness beside the Stream<br>
 Of Life, and joy for us shall ever gleam;<br>
 Our hearts with thankfulness shall sweetly sing<br>
 And grander blissfulness each day will bring.</p>
 <p>And if we do not reach that spirit realm,<br>
 Where bodyless each soul may ages whelm<br>
 With joy unutterable; still we live,<br>
 With bodies knew upon dear Earth, and give<br>
 Our newer life to children with our blood.<br>
 Or if these blessings we should miss; in wood,<br>
 Or glen, or garden, field, or emerald seas,<br>
 Our forms shall spring again; in such as these<br>
 We see around us throbbing with sweet life,<br>
 In trees or flowerets.<br>
                        This needs no belief<br>
 On which to base the fabric of a dream,<br>
 For Earth her children from death doth redeem,<br>
 And each contributes to continuous bloom;<br>
 So go your way! ye sisters, to your gloom!</p>
 <p>Far on their road have come the king of fame<br>
 And seer, within the land of Mas <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">5</font></a> they came,<br>
 Nor knew that Fate was hovering o'er their way,<br>
 In gentle converse they have passed the day.<br>
 Some twenty <i>kaspu</i> o'er the hills and plain,<br>
 They a wild forest in the mountain gain,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a></p>
 <p>In a deep gorge they rode through thickets wild,<br>
 Beneath the pines; now to a pass they filed,<br>
 And lo! two dragons <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_247"><font size="1">6</font></a> near a cave contend<br>
 Their path! with backs upreared their coils unbend,<br>
 Extend their ravenous jaws with a loud roar<br>
 That harshly comes from mouths of clotted gore.</p>
 <p>The sky o'erhead with lowering clouds is cast,<br>
 Which Anu in his rage above them massed.<br>
 Dark tempests fly above from Rimmon's breath,<br>
 Who hovers o'er them with the gods of death;<br>
 The wicked seven winds howl wildly round,<br>
 And crashing cedars falling shake the ground.<br>
 Now Tsil-lattu her black wings spreads o'er all,<br>
 Dark shrouding all the forest with her pall,<br>
 And from his steed for safety each dismounts,<br>
 And o'er their heads now break the ebon founts.<br>
 But hark! what is that dreadful roaring noise?<br>
 The dragons come! Their flaming crests they poise<br>
 Above, and nearer blaze their eyes of fire,<br>
 And see! upon them rush the monsters dire.</p>
 <p>The largest springs upon the giant Sar,<br>
 Who parrying with the sword he used in war,<br>
 With many wounds it pierces, drives it back;<br>
 Again it comes, renews its fierce attack,<br>
 With fangs outspread its victims to devour,<br>
 High o'er the monarch's head its crest doth tower,<br>
 Its fiery breath upon his helm doth glow.</p>
 <p>Exposed its breast! he strikes! his blade drives through<br>
 Its vitals! Dying now it shakes the ground,<br>
 And furious lashes all the forest round.<br>
 But hark! what is that awful lingering shriek<br>
 And cries of woe, that on his ears wild break?<br>
 A blinding flash, see! all the land reveals,<br>
 With dreadful roars, and darkness quick conceals<br>
 The fearful sight, to ever after come<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a></p>
 <p>Before his eyes, wherever he may roam.<br>
 The King, alas! too late Heabani drags<br>
 From the beast's fangs, that dies beneath the crags<br>
 O'erhanging near the cave. And now a din<br>
 Loud comes from <i>dalkhi</i> that around them spin<br>
 In fierce delight, while hellish voices rise<br>
 In harsh and awful mockery; the cries<br>
 Of agony return with taunting groans,<br>
 And mock with their fell hate those piteous moans.</p>
 <p>Amazed stands Izdubar above his seer,<br>
 Nor hears the screams, nor the fierce <i>dalkhi's</i> jeer;<br>
 Beneath the flashing lightnings he soon found<br>
 The cave, and lays the seer upon the ground.<br>
 His breaking heart now cries in agony,<br>
 "Heabani! O my seer, thou must not die!<br>
 Alas! dread Mam-mitu hath led us here,<br>
 Awake for me! arouse! my noble seer!<br>
 I would to gods of Erech I had died<br>
 For thee! my seer! my strength! my kingdom's pride!"</p>
 <p>The seer at last revives and turns his face<br>
 With love that death touched not, his hand doth place<br>
 With friendly clasp in that of his dear king,<br>
 And says:<br>
               "Grieve not, belovèd friend, this thing<br>
 Called death at last must come, why should we fear?<br>
 'Tis Hades' mist that opens for thy seer!<br>
 The gods us brought, nor asked consent, and life<br>
 They give and take away from all this strife<br>
 That must be here, my life I end on earth;<br>
 Both joy and sorrow I have seen from birth;<br>
 To Hades' awful land, whence none return,<br>
 Heabani's face in sorrow now must turn.<br>
 My love for thee, mine only pang reveals,<br>
 For this alone I grieve."<br>
                             A teardrop steals<br>
 Across his features, shining 'neath the light<br>
 The King has lit to make the cavern bright.</p>
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a></p>
 <p>"But oh, friend Izdubar, my King, when I<br>
 From this dear earth to waiting Hades fly,<br>
 Grieve not; and when to Erech you return,<br>
 Thou shalt in glory reign, and Zaidu learn<br>
 As thy companion all that thine own heart<br>
 Desires, thy throne thou wilt to him impart.<br>
 The female, Samkha, whom he brought to me<br>
 Is false, in league with thine own enemy.<br>
 And she will cause thee mischief, seek to drive<br>
 Thee from thy throne; but do not let her live<br>
 Within the walls of Erech, for the gods<br>
 Have not been worshipped in their high abodes.<br>
 When thou returnest, to the temple go,<br>
 And pray the gods to turn from thee the blow<br>
 Of Anu's fury, the strong god, who reigns<br>
 Above, and sent these woes upon the plains.<br>
 His anger raised against thee, even thee,<br>
 Must be allayed, or thy goods thou shalt see,<br>
 And kingdom, all destroyed by his dread power.<br>
 But Khasisadra will to thee give more<br>
 Advice when thou shalt meet the ancient seer,<br>
 For from thy side must I soon disappear."<br>
 The seer now ceased, and on his couch asleep<br>
 Spoke not, and Izdubar alone doth weep.</p>
 <p>And thus twelve days were past, and now the seer<br>
 Of the great change he saw was drawing near<br>
 Informed his King, who read to him the prayers,<br>
 And for the end each friendly act prepares,<br>
 Then said: "O my Heabani, dearest friend,<br>
 I would that I thy body could defend<br>
 From thy fierce foe that brings the end to thee.<br>
 My friend in battle I may never see<br>
 Again, when thou didst nobly stand beside<br>
 Me; with my seer and friend I then defied<br>
 All foes; and must thou leave thy friend, my seer?<br>
 "Alas! my King, I soon shall leave thee here."</p>
