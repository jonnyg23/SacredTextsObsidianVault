 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FIGHT WITH THE WINGED BULL OF ANU</h3>
 <p>The gods appear above to watch the fight,<br>
 And Erech's <i>masari</i> rush in affright<br>
 To Izdubar, who sits upon his throne,<br>
 Before him fall in speechless terror prone.</p>
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p>
 <p>A louder roar now echoes from the skies,<br>
 And Erech's Sar without the palace flies.<br>
 He sees the monster light upon the plain,<br>
 And calls Heabani with the choicest men<br>
 Of Erech's spearsmen armed, who fall in line<br>
 Without the gates, led by their Sar divine.</p>
 <p>And now the monster rushed on Izdubar,<br>
 Who meets it as the god of chase and war.<br>
 With whirling sword before the monster's face,<br>
 He rains his blows upon its front of brass<br>
 And horns, and drives it from him o'er the plain,<br>
 And now with spreading wings it comes again,<br>
 With maddened fury; fierce its eyeballs glare.<br>
 It rides upon the monarch's pointed spear;<br>
 The scales the point have turned, and broke the haft.<br>
 Then as a pouncing hawk when sailing daft,<br>
 In swiftest flight o'er him drops from the skies,<br>
 But from the gleaming sword it quickly flies.<br>
 Three hundred warriors now nearer drew<br>
 To the fierce monster, which toward them flew;<br>
 Into their midst the monster furious rushed,<br>
 And through their solid ranks resistless pushed<br>
 To stay Heabani, onward fought and broke<br>
 Two lines and through the third, which met the shock<br>
 With ringing swords upon his horns and scales.<br>
 At last the seer it reaches, him impales<br>
 With its sharp horns: but valiant is the seer--<br>
 He grasps its crest and fights without a fear.<br>
 The monster from his sword now turns to fly;<br>
 Heabani grasps its tail, and turns his eye<br>
 Towards his king, while scudding o'er the plain.<br>
 So quickly has it rushed and fled amain,<br>
 That Izdubar its fury could not meet,<br>
 But after it be sprang with nimble feet.</p>
 <p>Heabani loosed his grasp and stumbling falls,<br>
 And to his king approaching, thus he calls:<br>
 "My friend, our strongest men are overthrown:<br>
 But see! he comes! such strength was never known.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>
 <p>With all my might I held him, but he fled!<br>
 We both it can destroy! Strike at its head!<br>
 Like Rimmon now he flies upon the air,<br>
 As sceptred Nebo, <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="#fn_221"><font size="1">1</font></a> he his horns doth bear,<br>
 That flash with fire along the roaring skies,<br>
  <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="#fn_222"><font size="1">2</font></a> Around the Sar and seer he furious flies.<br>
 Heabani grasps the plunging horns, nor breaks<br>
 His grasp; in vain the monster plunging shakes<br>
 His head, and roaring, upward furious rears.<br>
 Heabani's strength the mighty monster fears;<br>
 He holds it in his iron grasp, and cries:<br>
 "Quick! strike!" Beneath the blows the monster dies;<br>
 And Izdubar now turned his furious face<br>
 Toward the gods, and on the beast doth place<br>
 His foot; he raised his gory sword on high,<br>
 And sent his shout defiant to the sky:<br>
 "'Tis thus, ye foes divine! the Sar proclaims<br>
 His war against your power, and highest names!<br>
 Hurl! hurl! your darts of fire, ye vile <i>kal-bi</i>! <a name="fr_225"></a><a href="#fn_223"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 My challenge hear! ye cravens of the sky!</p>
