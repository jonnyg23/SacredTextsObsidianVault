 <h3 align="CENTER">ZAIDU'S RETURN, AND HIS INSTRUCTION TO TAKE TWO MAIDS WITH HIM TO ENTICE THE SEER FROM HIS CAVE</h3>
 <p>Prince Zaidu prostrate bows before the Sar,<br>
 Arises, thus narrates to Izdubar:<br>
 "Thy sovereign, Zaidu hath his king obeyed,<br>
 The royal mission I have thus essayed<br>
 As Anu's <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">1</font></a> soldier; I undaunted tried<br>
 To urge my mission which the seer denied.<br>
 I firmly met the beast that with him came:<br>
 Unmanly fear, confess I to my shame,<br>
 Came o'er me when I first beheld the beast,<br>
 In vain I plead, and in despair I ceased<br>
 When he refused, and angry from me passed<br>
 Within his cave, where cliffs and rocks are massed;<br>
 I climbed, but the wild entrance did not gain,<br>
 And for advice have I returned again."</p>
 <p>"'Tis well, my son," the Sar to Zaidu said,<br>
 "Thy wisdom I commend for thy young head,<br>
 Again upon thy mission thou must go.<br>
 His might, and strength of purpose, thou dost know,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 47</font></a></p>
 <p>Before a maiden's charms will flee away;<br>
 For he doth love the Zi-Ga-bri <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">2</font></a> that play<br>
 Within the mountain gorges. Turn thy face<br>
 Again with manly portance; for I'll grace<br>
 Thine embassy with two of our sweet maids,<br>
 Who oft shall cheer thee through the mountain glades,<br>
 Whom thou shalt lead before Heabani's den<br>
 With their bright charms exposed within the glen.<br>
 Take Sam-kha-tu and sweet Khar-imatu:<br>
 They will entice the seer when he shall view<br>
 Their charms displayed before his wondering eyes.<br>
 With Sam-kha, Joy, the seer you will surprise;<br>
 Khar-im-tu will thy plans successful end,<br>
 To her seductive glance his pride will bend.<br>
 Sweet Sam-kha's charms are known, she is our Joy,<br>
 As Ishtar's aid her charms ne'er cloy;<br>
 Kharun-tu with her perfect face and form,<br>
 The hearts of all our court doth take by storm:<br>
 When joys by our sweet Sam-kha are distilled,<br>
 Kharun-tu's love o'ercomes us till we yield.<br>
 Thus, armed with Love's Seduction and her Joy,<br>
 The greatest powers of earth thou dost employ;<br>
 No flesh can face them but a heart of stone,<br>
 And all the world doth lie before them prone."</p>
 <p>Three days Prince Zaidu sat with Kharun-tu<br>
 Before the cave within Heabani's view;<br>
 Beside the pool they waited for the seer:<br>
 From Erech three days' journey brought them here,<br>
 But where hath joy, sweet Sam-kha, roving gone?<br>
 When they arrived at setting of the sun<br>
 She disappeared within with waving arms<br>
 With bright locks flowing she displayed her charms.<br>
 As some sweet <i>zir-ru</i> did young Sam-kha seem,<br>
 A thing of beauty of some mystic dream.</p>
