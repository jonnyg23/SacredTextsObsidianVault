 <h3 align="CENTER">THE KING AND SEER CONVERSING ON THEIR WAY TO KHASISADRA--INTERPRETATION OF THE KING'S DREAM IN THE PALACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL</h3>
 <p>"The dream, my seer, which I beheld last night<br>
 Within our tent, may bring to us delight.<br>
 I saw a mountain summit flash with fire,<br>
 That like a royal robe or god's attire<br>
 Illumined all its sides. The omen might<br>
 Some joy us bring, for it was shining bright."<br>
 And thus the Sar revealed to him his dream.</p>
 <p>Heabani said, "My friend, though it did seem<br>
 Propitious, yet, deceptive was it all,<br>
 And came in memory of Elam's fall.<br>
 The mountain burning was Khumbaba's halls<br>
 We fired, when all his soldiers from the walls<br>
 Had fled;--the <i>ni-takh-garri</i>, <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a>--on that morn,<br>
 Of such deceptive dreams, I would thee warn!"</p>
 <p>Some twenty <i>kaspu</i> they have passed this day,<br>
 At thirty <i>kaspu</i> they dismount to pray<br>
 And raise an altar, Samas to beseech<br>
 That they their journey's end may safely reach.<br>
 The tent now raised, their evening meal prepare<br>
 Beneath the forest in the open air;<br>
 And Izdubar brought from the tent the dream<br>
 He dreamed the festal night when Ishtar came<br>
 To him;--he reads it from a written scroll:<br>
 "Upon my sight a vision thus did fall:<br>
 I saw two men that night beside a god;<br>
 One man a turban wore, and fearless trod.<br>
 The god reached forth his hand and struck him down<br>
 Like mountains hurled on fields of corn, thus prone</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>
 <p>He lay; and Izdubar then saw the god<br>
 Was Anatu, <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">2</font></a> who struck him to the sod.<br>
 The troubler of all men, Samu's fierce queen,<br>
 Thus struck the turbaned man upon the plain.<br>
 He ceased his struggling, to his friend thus said:<br>
 'My friend, thou askest not why I am laid<br>
 Here naked, nor my low condition heed.<br>
 Accursèd thus I lie upon the mead;<br>
 The god has crushed me, burned my limbs with fire.'</p>
 <p>The vision from mine eyes did then expire.<br>
 A third dream came to me, which I yet fear,<br>
 The first beyond my sight doth disappear.<br>
 A fire-god thundering o'er the earth doth ride;<br>
 The door of darkness burning flew aside;<br>
 Like a fierce stream of lightning, blazing fire,<br>
 Beside me roared the god with fury dire,<br>
 And hurled wide death on earth on every side;<br>
 And quickly from my sight it thus did glide,<br>
 And in its track I saw a palm-tree green<br>
 Upon a waste, naught else by me was seen."</p>
 <p>Heabani pondering, thus explained the dream:<br>
 "My friend, the god was Samas, who doth gleam<br>
 With his bright glory, power, our God and Lord,<br>
 Our great Creator King, whose thunders roared<br>
 By thee, as through yon sky he takes his way;<br>
 For his great favor we should ever pray.<br>
 The man thou sawest lying on the plain<br>
 Was thee, O King,--to fight such power is vain.<br>
 Thus Anatu will strike thee with disease,<br>
 Unless thou soon her anger shalt appease;<br>
 And if thou warrest with such foes divine,<br>
 The fires of death shall o'er thy kingdom shine.<br>
 The palm-tree green upon the desert left<br>
 Doth show that we of hope are not bereft;<br>
 The gods for us their shares have surely weft, <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 One shall be taken, and the other left."</p>
