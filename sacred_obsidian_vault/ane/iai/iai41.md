 <h3 align="CENTER">THE GRIEF OF THE KING OVER THE LOSS OF HIS SEER, AND HIS PRAYER TO THE MOON-GOD, WHO ANSWERS HIS PRAYER WITH A VISION</h3>
 <p>The King weeps bitterly with flowing tears<br>
 Above his seer when from him disappears<br>
 The last faint breath; and then in deepest woe<br>
 He cries: "And through that desert must I go?<br>
 Heabani, thou to me wast like the gods;<br>
 Oh, how I loved thee! must thou turn to clods?<br>
 Through that dread desert must I ride alone;<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p>
 <p>And leave thee here, Heabani, lying prone?<br>
 Alas, I leave thee in this awful place,<br>
 To find our Khasisadra, seek his face,<br>
 The son of Ubara-tutu, the seer;<br>
 Oh, how can I, my friend, thus leave thee here?<br>
 This night through those dark mountains I must go,<br>
 I can no longer bear this awful woe:<br>
 If I shall tarry here, I cannot sleep.<br>
 O Sin, bright moon-god, of yon awful deep!<br>
 I pray to thee upon my face, oh, hear<br>
 My prayer! my supplications bring thou near<br>
 To all the gods! grant thou to me,--e'en me,<br>
 A heart of strength and will to worship thee.</p>
 <p>Oh, is this death like that the seer hath dreamed?<br>
 Perhaps the truth then on his spirit gleamed!<br>
 If Land of Silver Sky is but a myth,<br>
 The other dream is true! e'en all he saith!<br>
 Oh, tell me, all ye sparkling stars,<br>
 That wing above thy glorious flight,<br>
     And feel not Nature's jars;<br>
 But grandly, sweetly fling thy light<br>
 To our bright world beneath serene,<br>
     Hath mortals on thee known<br>
 Or viewed beyond,--that great Unseen,<br>
 Their future fate by gods been shown?</p>
 <p>Oh, hear me, all ye gods on high!<br>
 To gods who love mankind I pray,<br>
 Despairing, oh, I cry!<br>
 Oh, drive these doubts and fears away!<br>
 And yet--and yet, what truths have we?<br>
 O wondrous mortal, must thou die?<br>
 Beyond this end thou canst not see,<br>
 O Life! O Death! O mystery!</p>
 <p>The body still is here, with feeling dead!<br>
 And sight is gone!--and hearing from his dead,<br>
 Nor taste, nor smell, nor warmth, nor breath of life!<br>
 Where is my seer? Perhaps, his spirit rife</p>
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a></p>
 <p>E'en now in nothingness doth wander lone!<br>
 In agony his thoughts! with spirit prone!<br>
 In dread despair!--If conscious then, O gods!<br>
 He spake the truth!--His body to the clods<br>
 Hath turned! By this we feel, or hear, or see,<br>
 And when 'tis gone,--exist?--in agony!<br>
 To Hades hath he gone? as he hath thought!<br>
 Alas, the thought is torture, where have wrought<br>
 The gods their fearful curse! Ah, let me think!<br>
 The Silver Sky? Alas, its shining brink<br>
 He hath not crossed. The wrathful gods deny<br>
 Him entrance! Where, oh, where do spirits fly<br>
 Whom gods have cursed? Alas, he is condemned<br>
 To wander lone in that dark world, contemned<br>
 And from the Light of Happy Fields is barred!<br>
 Oh, why do gods thus send a fate so hard,<br>
 And cruel? O dear moon-god, moon-god Sin!<br>
 My seer hath erred. Receive his soul within<br>
 To joys prepared for gods and men! Though seer<br>
 He was, he immortality did fear,<br>
 As some unknown awakening in space.<br>
 Oh, turn upon him thy bright blessèd face!<br>
 He was my friend! O moon-god, hear my prayer!<br>
 Imploring thee, doth pray thine Izdubar!"</p>
 <p>And lo! a vision breaks before his eyes!<br>
 The moon-god hides the shadows of the skies,<br>
 And sweeps above with his soft, soothing light<br>
 That streams around his face; he drives the night<br>
 Before his rays, and with his hands sweet peace<br>
 He spreads through all the skies; and Strife doth cease!<br>
 A girdle spans the Heavens with pure light<br>
 That shines around the River of the Night,<br>
 Within the circling rays a host appears!<br>
 The singers of the skies, as blazing spheres!<br>
 Hark! Hear their harps and lyres that sweetly sound!<br>
 They sing! Oh, how the glowing skies resound!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"O King of Light and joy and Peace,<br>
     Supreme thy love shall ever reign;<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p></dir>

 <p>Oh, can our songs of bliss here cease?<br>
     Our souls for joy cannot restrain,<br>
     Sweep! Sweep thy lyres again!</p>
 <p>The former things <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">1a</font></a>--are passed away,<br>
     Which we on earth once knew below;<br>
 And in this bright eternal day<br>
     We happiness alone can know<br>
     Where bliss doth ever flow."</p>
