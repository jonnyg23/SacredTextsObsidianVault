 <h3 align="CENTER">TAMMUZ IS RESTORED TO LIFE BY THE WATERS OF LIFE--HIS SONG OF LOVE</h3>
 <p>The nectared cup the queen placed to his lips,<br>
 And o'er his heaving breast the nectar drips,<br>
 And now his arms are folded round his queen,<br>
 And her fond kisses he returns again;<br>
 And see! they bring to him his harp of gold,<br>
 And from its strings, sweet music as of old<br>
 His skilful hands wake through the sounding domes;<br>
 Oh, how his Song of Love wakes those dark rooms!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"My Queen of Love comes to my arms!<br>
   Her faithful eyes have sought for me,<br>
 My Love comes to me with her charms;<br>
   Let all the world now happy be!<br>
       My queen has come again!</p>
 <p>Forever, dearest, let me rest<br>
   Upon the bosom of my queen!<br>
 Thy lips of love are honeyed best;<br>
   Come! let us fly to bowering green!<br>
         To our sweet bower again.</p></dir>

 <p>O Love on Earth! O Love in Heaven!<br>
   That dearest gift which gods have given,<br>
 Through all my soul let it be driven,<br>
   And make my heart its dearest haven,<br>
         For Love returns the kiss!</p>
 <p>Oh! let me pillow there within<br>
   Thy breast, and, oh, so sweetly rest,<br>
 My life anew shall there begin;<br>
   On thy sweet charms, oh, let me feast!<br>
         Life knows no sweeter bliss.</p>
 <p>Oh, let me feast upon thy lips,<br>
   As honey-bird the nectar sips,<br>
 And drink new rapture through my lips,<br>
   As honey-bee its head thus drips<br>
         In nectarine abyss!</p>
 <p>O Love, sweet queen I my heart is thine!<br>
   My Life I clasp within mine arms!<br>
 My fondest charmer, queen divine!<br>
   My soul surrenders to thy charms,<br>
         In bliss would fly away.</p>
 <p>No dearer joy than this I want;<br>
   If love is banished from that life<br>
 There bodyless, my soul would pant,<br>
   And pine away in hopeless grief,<br>
         If love be fled away.</p>
 <p>If Love should bide and fold her wings<br>
   In bowers of yonder gleaming skies,<br>
 Unmeaning then each bard oft sings<br>
   Of bliss that lives on earth and dies,--<br>
         I want such love as this.</p>
 <p>I want thy form, thy loving breast,<br>
   Mine arms of love surrounding thee,<br>
 And on thy bosom sweetly rest,<br>
   Or else that world were dead to me.<br>
         No other life is bliss.</p></dir>

 <p>If it is thus, my queen, I go<br>
   With joy to yonder blissful clime;<br>
 But if not so, then let me flow<br>
   To soil and streams through changing time,<br>
         To me would be more bliss.</p>
 <p>For then, in blooming flowerets, I<br>
   Could earth adorn, my soul delight,<br>
 And never thus on earth could die;<br>
   For though I should be hid from sight,<br>
         Would spring again with joy!</p>
 <p>And sing as some sweet warbling bird,<br>
   Or in the breezes wave as grain,<br>
 As yellow sun-birds there have whirred<br>
   On earth, could I thus live again,<br>
         That beauteous world enjoy!</p>
 <p>'Mid safflower-fields or waving cane,<br>
   Or in the honeysuckles lie,<br>
 In forms of life would breathe again,<br>
   Enjoy Earth's sweetest revelry,<br>
         And ever spring again!</p>
 <p>Each life to me new joys would bring,<br>
   In breast of beast or bird or flower,<br>
 In each new form new joys would spring,<br>
   And happy, ever, Love would soar!<br>
         Triumphant filled with joy!</p>
 <p>In jujube or tamarisk<br>
   Perhaps would come to life again,<br>
 Or in the form of fawns would frisk<br>
   'Mid violets upon the plain;<br>
         But I should live again!</p>
 <p>And throb beneath the glistening dew,<br>
   In bamboo tufts, or mango-trees,<br>
 In lotus bloom, and spring anew,<br>
   In rose-tree bud, or such as these<br>
       On Earth return again!</p></dir>

 <p>And I should learn to love my mate,<br>
   In beast or singing bird or flower,<br>
 For kiss of love in hope could wait;<br>
   Perhaps I then would come that hour,<br>
         In form I have again!</p>
 <p>And love you say, my queen, is there-,<br>
   Where I can breathe with life anew?<br>
 But is it so? My Love, beware!<br>
   For some things oft are false, some true,<br>
         But I thee trust again!</p>
 <p>We fly away! from gates away!<br>
   Oh, life of bliss! Oh, breath of balm!<br>
 With wings we tread the Silver Way,<br>
   To trailing vines and feathery palm,<br>
         To bower of love again."</p>
