 <h3 align="CENTER">INVOCATION</h3>
 <p>O LOVE, my queen and goddess, come to me;<br>
 My soul shall never cease to worship thee;<br>
 Come pillow here thy head upon my breast,<br>
 And whisper in my lyre thy softest, best,<br>
 And sweetest melodies of bright <i>Sami</i>, <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 Our Happy Fields <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a> above dear <i>Subartu</i>; <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 Come nestle closely with those lips of love<br>
 And balmy breath, and I with thee shall rove<br>
 Through <i>Sari</i> <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a> past ere life on earth was known,<br>
 And Time unconscious sped not, nor had flown.<br>
 Thou art our all in this impassioned life:<br>
 How sweetly comes thy presence ending strife,<br>
 Thou god of peace and Heaven's undying joy,<br>
 Oh, hast thou ever left one pain or cloy<br>
 Upon this beauteous world to us so dear?<br>
 To all mankind thou art their goddess here.<br>
 To thee we sing, our holiest, fairest god,<br>
 The One who in that awful chaos trod<br>
 And woke the Elements by Law of Love<br>
 To teeming worlds in harmony to move.<br>
 From chaos thou hast led us by thy hand,<br>
  <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">5</font></a> Thus spoke to man upon that budding land:<br>
 "The Queen of Heaven, of the dawn am I,<br>
 The goddess of all wide immensity,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>
 <p>For thee I open wide the golden gate<br>
 Of happiness, and for thee love create<br>
 To glorify the heavens and fill with joy<br>
 The earth, its children with sweet love employ."<br>
 Thou gavest then the noblest melody<br>
 And highest bliss--grand nature's harmony.<br>
 With love the finest particle is rife,<br>
 And deftly woven in the woof of life,<br>
 In throbbing dust or clasping grains of sand,<br>
 In globes of glistening dew that shining stand<br>
 On each pure petal, Love's own legacies<br>
 Of flowering verdure, Earth's sweet panoplies;<br>
 By love those atoms sip their sweets and pass<br>
 To other atoms, join and keep the mass<br>
 With mighty forces moving through all space,<br>
 'Tis thus on earth all life has found its place.<br>
 Through Kisar, <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">6</font></a> Love came formless through the air<br>
 In countless forms behold her everywhere!<br>
 Oh, could we hear those whispering roses sweet,<br>
 Three beauties bending till their petals meet,<br>
 And blushing, mingling their sweet fragrance there<br>
 In language yet unknown to mortal ear.<br>
 Their whisperings of love from morn till night<br>
 Would teach us tenderly to love the right.<br>
 O Love, here stay! Let chaos not return!<br>
 With hate each atom would its lover spurn<br>
 In air above, on land, or in the sea,<br>
 O World, undone and lost that loseth thee!<br>
 For love we briefly come, and pass away<br>
 For other men and maids; thus bring the day<br>
 Of love continuous through this glorious life.<br>
 Oh, hurl away those weapons fierce of strife!<br>
 We here a moment, point of time but live,<br>
 Too short is life for throbbing hearts to grieve.<br>
 Thrice holy is that form that love hath kissed,<br>
 And happy is that man with heart thus blessed.<br>
 Oh, let not curses fall upon that head<br>
 Whom love hath cradled on the welcome bed<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>
 <p>Of bliss, the bosom of our fairest god,<br>
 Or hand of love e'er grasp the venging rod.</p>
 <p>Oh, come, dear Zir-ri, <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">7</font></a> tune your lyres and lutes,<br>
 And sing of love with chastest, sweetest notes,<br>
 Of Accad's goddess Ishtar, Queen of Love,<br>
 And Izdubar, with softest measure move;<br>
 Great Samas' <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">8</font></a> son, of him dear Zir-ri sing!<br>
 Of him whom goddess Ishtar warmly wooed,<br>
 Of him whose breast with virtue was imbued.<br>
 He as a giant towered, lofty grown,<br>
 As Babil's <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">9</font></a> great <i>pa-te-si</i> <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">10</font></a> was he known,<br>
 His armèd fleet commanded on the seas<br>
 And erstwhile travelled on the foreign leas;<br>
 His mother Ellat-gula <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">1a</font></a> on the throne<br>
 From Erech all Kardunia <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">2</font></a> ruled alone.</p>
