 <h3 align="CENTER">THE RESCUE OF ERECH BY IZDUBAR</h3>
 <p>Heabani, weary, eyes his native land,<br>
 And on his harp now lays his trembling hand;<br>
 The song has ended in a joyous lay,<br>
 And yet, alas! his hands but sadly play:<br>
 Unused to hope, the strings refuse their aid<br>
 To tune in sympathy, and heartless played.<br>
 Again the minstrel bows his head in woe,<br>
 And the hot tear-drops from his eyelids flow,<br>
 And chanting now a mournful melody,<br>
 O'er Erech's fall, thus sang an elegy:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p> <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">1</font></a>"How long, O Ishtar, will thy face be turned,<br>
   While Erech desolate doth cry to thee?<br>
 Thy towers magnificent, oh, hast thou spurned?<br>
   Her blood like water in Ul-bar, <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">2</font></a> oh, see!<br>
 The seat of thine own oracle behold!<br>
   The fire hath ravaged all thy cities grand,<br>
 And like the showers of Heaven them all doth fold.<br>
   O Ishtar! broken-hearted do I stand!<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p></dir>

 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Oh, crush our enemies as yonder reed!<br>
   For hopeless, lifeless, kneels thy bard to thee,<br>
 And, oh! I would exalt thee in my need,<br>
   From thy resentment, anger, oh, us free!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>With eyes bedimmed with tears, he careful scans<br>
 The plain, "Perhaps the dust of caravans<br>
 It is! But no!! I see long lines of spears!<br>
 A warrior from the lifting cloud appears,<br>
 And chariots arrayed upon the plain!<br>
 And is the glorious omen not in vain?<br>
 What! no?" He rubs his eyes in wild surprise,<br>
 And drinks the vision while he loudly cries:<br>
 "Oh, joy! our standards flashing from afar!<br>
 He comes! he comes! our hero Izdubar!"<br>
 He grasps his harp inspired, again to wake<br>
 In song-the cry of battle now doth break.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Nin-a-rad, <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">3</font></a> servant of our great Nin <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">4</font></a><br>
   Shall lead our hosts to victory!<br>
 God of the chase and war, o'er him, oh, shine!<br>
   Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri! <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">5</font></a></p>
 <p>"Let Elam fall! the cause of Accad's woes,<br>
   Revenge of Erech, be the cry!<br>
 This land our father's blessed, our king they chose,<br>
   Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!<br>
 Our holy fathers sleep upon this plain,<br>
   We conquer, or we here will die;<br>
 For victory, then raise the cry, ye men!<br>
   Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>The minstrel ceases, lifts his hands on high,<br>
 And still we hear his joyful waning cry:<br>
 Now echoed by yon hosts along the sky,<br>
 "He comes! Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!<br>
 Great Accad's hosts arrayed with spears and shields<br>
 Are coming! see them flashing o'er the fields!<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 15</font></a></p>
 <p>And he! bright flashing as the god's attire,<br>
 Doth lead in burnished gold, our king of fire.<br>
 His armor shines through yonder wood and fen,<br>
 That tremble 'neath the tread of armèd men.<br>
 See! from his jewelled breastplate, helmet, fly<br>
 The rays like Samas from the cloudless sky!<br>
 How martially he rides his sable steed,<br>
 That proudly treads and lifts his noble head,<br>
 While eagerly he gallops down the line,<br>
 And bears his princely load with porte divine;<br>
 And now, along the plains there sounds afar<br>
 The piercing bugle-note of Izdubar;<br>
 For Erech's walls and turrets are in view,<br>
 And high the standards rise of varied hue.<br>
 The army halts; the twanging bows are strung;<br>
 And from their chariots the chieftains sprung.<br>
 The wheeling lines move at each chief's command,<br>
 With chariots in front;<br>
                            On either hand<br>
 Extend the lines of spears and cavalry,<br>
 A wingèd storm-cloud waiting for its prey:<br>
 And see! while Accad's army ready waits,<br>
 The enemy are swarming from the gates.<br>
 The charge, from either host, the trumpets sound,<br>
 And bristling chariots from each army bound:<br>
 A cloud of arrows flies from Accad's bows<br>
 That hides the sun, and falls among their foes.<br>
 Now roars the thunder of great Accad's cars,<br>
 Their brazen chariots as blazing stars<br>
 Through Nuk-khu's <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">6</font></a> depths with streams of blazing fire,<br>
 Thus fall upon the foe with vengeful ire.<br>
 The smoking earth shakes underneath their wheels,<br>
 And from each cloud their thunder loudly peals.<br>
 Thus Accad on their foes have fiercely hurled<br>
 Their solid ranks with Nin-rad's flag unfurled,<br>
 The charging lines meet with a fearful sound,<br>
 As tempests' waves from rocks in rage rebound;<br>
 The foe thus meet the men of Izdubar,<br>
 While o'er the field fly the fierce gods of war.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>
 <p>Dark Nin-a-zu <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">7</font></a> her torch holds in her hand.<br>
 With her fierce screams directs the gory brand;<br>
 And Mam-mit <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">8</font></a> urges her with furious hand,<br>
 And coiling dragons <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">9</font></a> poison all the land<br>
 With their black folds and pestilential breath,<br>
 In fierce delight thus ride the gods of death.</p>
 <p>The shouts of Accad mingle with the cries<br>
 Of wounded men and fiery steeds, which rise<br>
 From all the fields with shrieks of carnage, war,<br>
 Till victory crowns the host of Izdubar.<br>
 The chariots are covered with the slain,<br>
 And crushed beneath lie dead and dying men,<br>
 And horses in their harness wounded fall,<br>
 With dreadful screams, and wildly view the wall<br>
 Of dying warriors piling o'er their heads,<br>
 And wonder why each man some fury leads;<br>
 And others break across the gory plain<br>
 In mad career till they the mountain gain;<br>
 And snorting on the hills in wild dismay,<br>
 One moment glance below, then fly away;<br>
 Away from sounds that prove their masters, fiends,<br>
 Away to freedom snuffing purer winds,<br>
 Within some cool retreat by mountain streams,<br>
 Where peacefully for them, the sun-light gleams.<br>
 At last the foe is scattered o'er the plain,<br>
 And Accad fiercely slays the flying men;<br>
 When Izdubar beholds the victory won<br>
 By Accad's grand battalions of the sun,<br>
 His bugle-call the awful carnage stays,<br>
 Then loud the cry of victory they raise.</p>
