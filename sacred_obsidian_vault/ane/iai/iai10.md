 <h3 align="CENTER">IZDUBAR RELATES HIS SECOND DREAM TO HIS SEERS, WHO CANNOT INTERPRET IT</h3>
 <p>The counsellors assembled round the throne<br>
 Within the council halls of <i>zam-at</i> <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a> stone,<br>
 Now greet their monarch, and behold his face<br>
 With trouble written on his brow, and trace<br>
 Uneasiness within that eagle eye,<br>
 While be with stately tread, yet wearily<br>
 Ills throne approached; he turned to the <i>mu-di</i>, <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 And swept a glance upon his khas-iz-i. <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>
 Uneasy they all eyed his troubled face,<br>
 For he had ridden at a furious pace.<br>
 The <i>abuli</i> <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">4</font></a> had told them on that morn,<br>
 How he across the plains had wildly torn</p>
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>
 <p>To drive away some vision of the night.<br>
 One asked, "Hath our Sardan-nu's dreams been light?<br>
 Or hath dread phantoms o'er thy pillow hung?<br>
 For trouble on thy countenance hath clung."<br>
 The monarch startled at the question eyes<br>
 The councillor, and to him thus replies:<br>
 "'Tis true, my counsellors and wisest men,<br>
 I dreamed a fearful dream Sat mu-si; <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">5</font></a> when<br>
 I have disclosed it, if one clear reveals<br>
 Its meaning all and naught from me conceals,<br>
 On him will I the greatest wealth bestow:<br>
 I will ennoble him, and the <i>sib-zu</i> <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">6</font></a><br>
 A <i>ku-bar-ra</i> <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">7</font></a> for him shall rich prepare;<br>
 As my <i>tur-tan-it</i> <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">8</font></a> he shall be, and seer,<br>
 Decked with a golden chain shall next preside<br>
 At every feast, and break his bread beside<br>
 The King, and highest rank he shall attain<br>
 'Mong counsellors, and mine own favor gain;<br>
 And seven wives to him I will allow,<br>
 And a grand palace. This as King I vow,<br>
 The scribe it shall enroll above my seal<br>
 As Erech's Sar's decree beyond repeal.</p>
 <p>I dreamed upon my <i>dum-khi</i> <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">9</font></a> fast asleep,<br>
 The stars from heaven fell from yonder deep<br>
 To earth; and one, with fierceful heat my back<br>
 Did pierce as molten fire, and left its track<br>
 Of flames like some huge ball along my spine;<br>
 And then transformed, it turned its face to mine;<br>
 As some fierce god it glowed before my sight<br>
 Till agony was lost in dread affright.<br>
 I rooted stood, in terror, for its face<br>
 Was horrible; I saw in its feet's place<br>
 A lion's claws. It sprang, my strength it broke,<br>
 And slew me, gloating over me! Awoke,<br>
 I sprang, methought I was a corpse <i>ka-ra</i> <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">10</font></a></p>

 <i></i><p>Va tat-ka mat sar, talka bit-la sha<br>
 Ra-pas-ti sat-ti, ar-id-da! ka-ra,<br>
 Va hal-li-ka! lik-ru-bu ki-mi-ta!<br>
 The seers in silence stand, perplexed and think;<br>
 But from the task at once the wisest shrink.<br>
 The King each face soon read:<br>
                                     "Ye tell me no?"<br>
 And nodding all, concealed from him their woe,<br>
 For they beheld within the dream some fate<br>
 Impending o'er him born of godly hate,<br>
 And durst not to their monarch prate their fears,<br>
 For flatterers of kings are all his seers.<br>
 The King impatient eyed them all with scorn,<br>
 And hid his thoughts by wildest passions born;<br>
 And then at last contemptuous to them said,<br>
 "So all my seers of trouble are afraid?<br>
 Or else in ignorance you turn away;<br>
 'Tis well! I sorely need a seer this day."<br>
 And they now prostrate fall before his throne,<br>
 "Forgive thy seers!" one cries, "O mighty One!<br>
 For we this dreadful dream do fear portends<br>
 Thy harm! a god some message to thee sends!<br>
 We know not what, but fear for thee, our Sar,<br>
 And none but one can augur it; afar<br>
 He lives, Heabani should before the King<br>
 Be brought from <i>Za-Ga-bri</i> <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">1</font></a> the <i>na-bu</i> <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">2</font></a> bring!"<br>
 "'Tis well! Prince Zaidu for the hermit send,<br>
 And soon this mystery your Sar will end."<br>
 The King distressed now to the temple goes<br>
 To lay before the mighty gods his woes;<br>
 This prayer recites to drive away bad dreams,<br>
 While Samas' holy altar brightly gleams:<br>
  <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">3</font></a>"O Samas! may my prayer bring me sweet rest,<br>
 And may my Lord his favor grant to me:<br>
 Annihilate the things that me invest!</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>
 <p>This day, O God! distressed, I cry to thee!<br>
 O goddess! be thou gracious unto me,<br>
 Receive my prayer, my sins forgive I pray:<br>
 My wickedness and will arrayed 'gainst thee.<br>
 Oh, pardon me! O God, be kind this day,<br>
 My groaning may the seven winds destroy,<br>
 Clothe me with deep humility! receive<br>
 My prayers, as wingèd birds, oh, may they fly<br>
 And fishes carry them, and rivers weave<br>
 Them in the waters on to thee, O God!<br>
 As creeping things of the vast desert, cry<br>
 I unto thee outstretched on Erech's sod;<br>
 And from the river's lowest depths I pray;<br>
 My heart cause thou to shine like polished gold,<br>
 Though food and drink of Nin-a-zu <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">4</font></a> this day<br>
 Be mine, while worms and death thy servant fold.<br>
 Oh, from thine altar me support, protect,<br>
 In low humility I pray, forgive!<br>
 Feed me with joy, my dreams with grace direct;<br>
 The dream I dreamed, oh favorable give<br>
 To me its omen filled with happiness!<br>
 May Mak-hir <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">5</font></a>, god of dreams, my couch invest!<br>
 With visions of Bit-sag-gal my heart bless,<br>
 The temple of the gods, of Nin, with rest<br>
 Unbroken, and to Merodach I pray!<br>
 The favoring one, to prosper me and mine:<br>
  <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">6</font></a>Oh, may thy entering exalted be!<br>
 And thy divinity with glory shine,<br>
 And may our city shine with glowing meads,<br>
 And all my people praise thy glorious deeds."<br>
 Now to Euphrates' banks the Sar and seers<br>
 Their footsteps turn to pray into the ears<br>
 Of Hea, <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">7</font></a> where, in white, a hand of priests<br>
 Drawn in a crescent, Izdubar invests.<br>
 Now at the water's edge he leans, his hands</p>

 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p>Dips in the waves, and pours upon the sands<br>
 The sparkling drops, while all a hymn descant<br>
 To Hea, thus the incantation chant:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"O chant our incantation to the waters pure,<br>
      Euphrates' waters flowing to the sea!<br>
 Where Hea's holy face shines bright on every shore,<br>
      O Sabit! <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">8</font></a> of Timatu <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">9</font></a> to ye<br>
 We pray! may your bright waters glowing shine<br>
 As Hea's face, and heaving breast divine!</p>
 <p>"O Sabit, to your father Hea take our prayer!<br>
  And may Dao-ki-na, <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">10</font></a> your bright mother, hear!<br>
  With joy, oh shine, as peaceful as the sleeping light,<br>
  O ever may your throbbing waves be bright.<br>
         O spirit of the Heaven, hear!<br>
            Remember us, Remember!<br>
         O spirit of the earth, come near!<br>
            Remember us, Remember!<br>
  O hear us, Hea! hear us, dear Dao-ki-na!<br>
