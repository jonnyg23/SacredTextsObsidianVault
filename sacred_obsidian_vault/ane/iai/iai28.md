 <h3 align="CENTER">ISHTAR COMPLAINS TO ANU, KING OF HEAVEN, WHO CREATES A WINGED BULL TO DESTROY ISHTAR</h3>
 <p>Before the throne of Arm, Ishtar cries,<br>
 And Anatu, the sovereigns of the skies:<br>
 "O Sar, this king my beauty doth despise,<br>
 My sweetest charms beholds not with his eyes."<br>
 And Anu to his daughter thus replied:<br>
 "My daughter, thou must crush his vaunting pride,<br>
 And he will claim thy beauty and thy charms,<br>
 And gladly lie within thy glorious arms."<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a></p>
 <p>"I hate him now, O Sar, as I did love!<br>
 Against the strength of Anu let him prove<br>
 His right divine to rule without our aid,<br>
 Before the strength of Ann let him bleed.<br>
 Upon this giant Sar so filled with pride,<br>
 Let Anu's winged bull <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">1</font></a> in fury ride,<br>
 And I will aid the beast to strike him prone,<br>
 Till he in death shall breathe his dying groan."<br>
 And Ann said: "If thou to it shall join<br>
 Thy strength, which all thy noble names define<br>
 Thy glories <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">2</font></a> and thy power thus magnified,<br>
 Will humble him, who has thy power defied."<br>
 And Ishtar thus: "By all my might as queen<br>
 Of war and battles, where I proudly reign,<br>
 This Sar my hands shall strike upon the plain,<br>
 And end his strength and all his boastings vain.<br>
 By all the noble names with gods I hold<br>
 As queen of war, this giant monarch bold,<br>
 Who o'er mine ancient city thinks to reign,<br>
 Shall lie for birds of prey upon the plain.<br>
 For answering my love for thee with scorn,<br>
 Proud monarch! from thy throne thou shalt be torn!"</p>
 <p>For Ishtar, Anu from the clouds creates<br>
 A shining monster with thick brazen plates<br>
 And horns of adamant; <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="#fn_220"><font size="1">3</font></a> and now it flies<br>
 Toward the palace, roaring from the skies.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_218"></a><a href="iai28.htm#fr_220">84:1</a> "Anu's winged bull," Taurus, constellation of the heavens.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_219"></a><a href="iai28.htm#fr_221">84:2</a> "Glories" ("maskhi"). This word is not translated by Mr. Sayce.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="iai28.htm#fr_222">84:3</a> "Horns of adamant." Sayce translates in l. 22, Col. v., horns of crystal--"thirty manehs of crystal," etc. The caning probably of "zamat stone," as given by Smith, was a hard substance, such as the diamond or adamant. By some translators it has been rendered onyx, and others lazuli.</p>
