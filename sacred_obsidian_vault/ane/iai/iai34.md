 <h3 align="CENTER">PAPSUKUL, THE GOD OF HOPE, AND HERALD OF THE GODS, FLIES FROM THE EARTH AND INTERCEDES FOR THE RELEASE OF ISHTAR, AND HEA GRANTS HIS PRAYER</h3>
 <p>O Hope! thou fleeting pleasure of the mind,<br>
 Forever with us stay, our hearts to bind!<br>
 We cling to thee till life has fled away;<br>
 Our dearest phantom, ever with us stay!<br>
 Without thee, we have naught but dread despair,<br>
 The worst of all our torments with us here;<br>
 Oh, come with thy soft pinions, o'er us shine!<br>
 And we will worship thee, a god divine:<br>
 The <i>ignis fatuus</i> of all our skies<br>
 That grandly leads us, vanishes and dies,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a></p>
 <p>And we are left to grope in darkness here,<br>
 Without a ray of light our lives to cheer.<br>
 Oh, stay! sweet Love's companion, ever stay!<br>
 And let us hope with love upon our way!<br>
 We reck not if a phantom thou hast been,<br>
 And we repent that we have ever seen<br>
 Thy light on earth to lead us far astray;<br>
 Forever stay! or ever keep away!</p>
 <p>When Papsukul beheld in man's abodes<br>
 The change that spread o'er blasted, lifeless clods,<br>
 And heard earth's wailing through the waning light,<br>
 With vegetation passing out of sight,<br>
 From the doomed world to Heaven he quickly flies,<br>
 While from the earth are rising fearful cries.<br>
 To Samas' throne he speeds with flowing tears,<br>
 And of the future dark he pours his fears.<br>
 To Sin, the moon-god, Pap-su-kul now cries<br>
 O'er Ishtar's fate, who in black Hades lies;<br>
 O'er Earth's dire end, which with Queen Ishtar dies;<br>
 To Hea he appeals with mournful cries:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"O Hea, our Creator, God and King!<br>
   Queen Ishtar now is lying prone.<br>
 To Earth, our godly queen again, oh, bring!<br>
   I trust thy love, O Holy One!<br>
 To all the gods who reign o'er us on high<br>
   I pray! thus Hope thine aid implores,<br>
 Release our queen! To Hades quickly fly!<br>
   Thy Pap-su-kul with faith adores.</p>
 <p>"The bull hath left the lowing kine bereaved,<br>
   And sulking dies in solitude;<br>
 The ass hath fled away, his mates bath grieved,<br>
   And women are no more imbued<br>
 With love, and drive their husbands far away,<br>
   And wives enjoy not their caress;<br>
 All peace and love have gone from earth this day,<br>
   And love on earth knows not its bliss.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>The females die through all the living world,<br>
   Among all beasts, and men, and plants;<br>
 All love from them on earth have madly hurled,<br>
   For blissful love no more each pants;<br>
 And Samas' light is turned away from Earth,<br>
   And left alone volcanoes' fire;<br>
 The land is filled with pestilence and dearth,<br>
   All life on earth will soon expire."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>When Hea heard the solemn chant of Hope,<br>
 From his high throne he let his sceptre drop,<br>
 And cried: "And thus, I rule o'er all mankind!<br>
 For this, I gave them life, immortal mind;<br>
 To earth's relief, my herald shall quick go,<br>
 I hear thy prayer, and song of Ishtar's woe."</p>
 <p>"Go! At-su-su-namir, with thy bright head!<br>
 With all thy light spring forth! and quickly speed;<br>
 Towards the gates of Hades, turn thy face!<br>
 And quickly fly for me through yonder space.<br>
 Before thy presence may the seven gates<br>
 Of Hades open with their gloomy grates;<br>
 May Allat's face rejoice before thy sight,<br>
 Her rage be soothed, her heart filled with delight;<br>
 But conjure her by all the godly names,<br>
 And fearless be,--towards the roaring streams<br>
 Incline thine ear, and seek the path there spread.<br>
 Release Queen Ishtar! raise her godly head!<br>
 And sprinkle her with water from the stream;<br>
 Her purify! a cup filled to the brim<br>
 Place to her lips that she may drink it all.<br>
 The herald as a meteor doth fall,<br>
 With blazing fire disparts the hanging gloom<br>
 Around the gates of that dark world of doom."</p>
