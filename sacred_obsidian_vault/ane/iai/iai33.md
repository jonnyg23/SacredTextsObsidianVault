 <h3 align="CENTER">EFFECT OF ISHTAR'S IMPRISONMENT IN HADES--LOVE DEPARTS FROM THE EARTH--THE EARTH'S SOLEMN DIRGE OF WOE.</h3>
 <p>When Ishtar, Queen of Love, from Earth had flown,<br>
 With her love fled, and left all nature prone;<br>
 From Earth all peace with love then fled amain.<br>
 In loneliness the bull stalked o'er the plain,<br>
 And tossed his drooping crest toward the sky,<br>
 In sadness lay upon the green to die;<br>
 On the far kine looked weary and bereaved,<br>
 And turned toward the gods, and wondering grieved.<br>
 The troubled kine then gravely chewed their cud,<br>
 And hungerless in the rich pastures stood.<br>
 The ass his mate abandoned, fled away,<br>
 And loveless wives then cursed the direful day;<br>
 And loving husbands kiss their wives no more,<br>
 And doves their cooing ceased, and separate soar;<br>
 And love then died in. all the breasts of men,<br>
 And strife supreme on earth was reveling then.</p>
 <p>The sexes of mankind their wars divide,<br>
 And women hate all men, and them deride;<br>
 And some demented hurl aside their gowns,<br>
 And queens their robes discard and jewelled crowns,<br>
 And rush upon the streets bereft of shame,<br>
 Their forms expose, and all the gods defame.<br>
 "Alas! from earth the Queen of Love has gone,<br>
 And lovers 'void their haunts with faces wan<br>
 And spurn from them the hateful thoughts of love,<br>
 For love no longer reigns, all life to move.<br>
 An awful thrill now speeds through Hades' doors,<br>
 And shakes with horror all the dismal floors;<br>
 A wail upon the breeze through space doth fly,<br>
 And howling gales sweep madly through the sky;<br>
 Through all the universe there speeds a pang<br>
 Of travail. Mam-nu-tu <a name="fr_234"></a><a href="#fn_232"><font size="1">1</font></a> appalled doth hang</p>
 <p>

 <p>Upon her blackened pinions in the air<br>
 And piteous from her path leads Black Despair,<br>
 "The queen in chains in Hades dying lies,<br>
 And life with her," they cry, "forever dies!"<br>
 Through misty glades and darkened depths of space,<br>
 Tornadoes roar her fate to Earth's sweet face;<br>
 The direful tidings from far Hades pour<br>
 Upon her bosom with their saddest roar;<br>
 Like moans of mighty powers in misery,<br>
 They bring the tale with awful minstrelsy.<br>
 And Earth her mists wrapped round her face in woe,<br>
 While icy pangs through all her breast deep flow.<br>
 Her bosom sobbing wails a mighty moan,<br>
 "Alas! for-ever my sweet queen hath flown!"<br>
 With shrieks of hurricane, and ocean's groan,<br>
 And sobbing of the winds through heights unknown,<br>
 Through mountain gorges sweep her wails of woe,<br>
 Through every land and seas, her sorrows flow:<br>
 Oh, moan! oh, moan! dear mountains, lakes, and seas!<br>
 Oh, weep with me dear plants, and flowers, and trees!<br>
 Alas! my beauty fading now will die!<br>
 Oh, weep, ye stars, for me in every sky!<br>
 Oh, Samas, hide thy face! I am undone!<br>
 Oh, weep with me Ur-ru, <a name="fr_235"></a><a href="#fn_233"><font size="1">2</font></a> my precious son.<br>
 Let all your notes of joy, my birds, be stilled;<br>
 Your mother's heart with dread despair is filled:</p>
 <p>Come back, my flowerets, with your fragrant dews;<br>
 Come, all my beauties, with your brightest hues;<br>
 Come back, my plants and buds and youngling shoots!<br>
 Within your mother's bosom hide your roots.<br>
 Oh, children, children! Love hath fled away,<br>
 Alas! that life I gave should see this day!<br>
 Your queen lies dying in her awful woe,<br>
 Oh, why should she from us to Hades go?"</p>
 <p>Wide Nature felt her woe, and ceased to spring,<br>
 And withered buds their vigor lost, and fling<br>
 No more their fragrance to the lifeless air;<br>
 The fruit-trees died, or barren ceased to bear;<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p>The male plants kiss their female plants no more;<br>
 And pollen on the winds no longer soar<br>
 To carry their caresses to the seed<br>
 Of waiting hearts that unavailing bleed,<br>
 Until they fold their petals in despair,<br>
 And dying, drop to earth, and wither there.<br>
 The growing grain no longer fills its head,<br>
 The fairest fields of corn lie blasted, dead.<br>
 All Nature mourning dons her sad attire,<br>
 And plants and trees with falling leaves expire.<br>
 And Samas' light and moon-god's soothing rays<br>
 Earth's love no more attracts; recurring days<br>
 Are shortened by a blackness deep profound<br>
 That rises higher as the days come round.<br>
 At last their light flees from the darkened skies,<br>
 The last faint gleam now passes, slowly dies.<br>
 Upon a blasted world, dread darkness falls,<br>
 O'er dying nature, crumbling cities' walls.<br>
 Volcanoes' fires are now the only light,<br>
 Where pale-faced men collect around in fright;<br>
 With fearful cries the lurid air they rend,<br>
 To all the gods their wild petitions send.</p>
