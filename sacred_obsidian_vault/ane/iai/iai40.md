 <h3 align="CENTER">HEABANI REVEALS TWO WONDERFUL VISIONS TO THE KING, ONE OF DEATH AND OBLIVION, AND THE OTHER OF HEAVEN, AND DIES IN THE ARMS OF THE KING</h3>
 <p>But, oh, my King! to thee I now reveal<br>
 A secret that my heart would yet conceal,<br>
 To thee, my friend, two visions I reveal:<br>
 The first I oft have dreamed beneath some spell<br>
 Of night, when I enwrapped from all the world,<br>
 With Self alone communed.<br>
                                Unconscious hurled<br>
 By wingèd thought beyond this present life,<br>
 I seeming woke in a Dark World where rife<br>
 Was Nothingness,--a darksome mist it seemed,<br>
 All eke was naught;--no light for me there gleamed;<br>
 And floating 'lone, which way I turned, saw naught;<br>
 Nor felt of substance 'neath my feet, nor fraught<br>
 With light was Space around; nor cheerful ray<br>
 Of single star. The sun was quenched; or day<br>
 Or night, knew not. No hands had I, nor feet,<br>
 Nor head, nor body, all was void. No heat<br>
 Or cold I felt, no form could feel or see;<br>
 And naught I knew but conscious entity.<br>
 No boundary my being felt, or had;<br>
 And speechless, deaf, and blind, and formless, sad,<br>
 I floated through dark space,--a conscious blank!<br>
 No breath of air my spirit moved; I sank<br>
 I knew not where, till motionless I ceased<br>
 At last to move, and yet I could not rest,<br>
 Around me spread the Limitless, and Vast.<br>
 My cheerless, conscious spirit,--fixed and fast<br>
 In some lone spot in space was moveless, stark!<br>
 An atom chained by forces stern and dark,<br>
 With naught around me. Comfortless I lived<br>
 In my dread loneliness! Oh, how I grieved!<br>
 And thus, man's fate in Life and Death is solved<br>
 With naught but consciousness, and thus involved</p>
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>
 <p>All men in hopes that no fruition have?<br>
 And this alone was all that death me gave?<br>
 That all had vanished, gone from me that life<br>
 Could give, and left me but a blank, with strife<br>
 Of rising thoughts, and vain regrets, to float;--<br>
 Away from life and light, be chained remote!</p>
 <p>Oh, how my spirit longed for some lone crag<br>
 To part the gloom beneath, and rudely drag<br>
 My senses back! or with its shock to end<br>
 My dire existence;--to oblivion send<br>
 Me quickly! How I strove to curse, and break<br>
 That soundless Void, with shrieks or cries, to wake<br>
 That awful silence which around me spread!<br>
 In vain! in vain! all but my soul was dead.<br>
 And then my spirit soundless cried within:<br>
 "Oh, take me! take me back to Earth again!"<br>
 For tortures of the flesh were bliss and joy<br>
 To such existence! Pain can never cloy<br>
 The smallest thrill of earthly happiness!<br>
 'Twas joy to live on earth in pain! I'll bless<br>
 Thee, gods, if I may see its fields I've trod<br>
 To kiss its fragrant flowers, and clasp the sod<br>
 Of mother Earth, that grand and beauteous world!<br>
 From all its happiness, alas! was hurled<br>
 My spirit,--then in frenzy--I awoke!<br>
 Great Bel! a dream it was! as vanished smoke<br>
 It sped! and I sprang from my couch and prayed<br>
 To all the gods, and thus my soul allayed.<br>
 And then with blessings on my lips, I sought<br>
 My couch, and dropped away in blissful thought<br>
 In dream the second:<br>
                           Then the Silver Sky<br>
 Came to me. Near the Stream of Life I lie:<br>
 My couch the rarest flowers; and music thrills<br>
 My soul! How soft and sweet it sounds from rills<br>
 And streams, and feathered songsters in the trees<br>
 Of Heaven's fruits!--e'en all that here doth please<br>
 The heart of man was there. In a dear spot<br>
 I lay, 'mid olives, spices, where was wrought<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>
 <p>A beauteous grotto; and beside me near,<br>
 Were friends I loved; and one both near and dear<br>
 With me reclined, in blissful converse, sweet<br>
 With tender thoughts.<br>
                          Our joy was lull, complete!<br>
 The ministering spirits there had spread<br>
 Before us all a banquet on the mead,<br>
 With Heaven's food and nectar for our feast;<br>
 And oh, so happy! How our joy increased<br>
 As moments flew, to years without an end!<br>
 To Courts Refulgent there we oft did wend.</p>
 <p>Beside a silver lake, a holy fane<br>
 There stood within the centre of the plain,<br>
 High built on terraces, with walls of gold,<br>
 Where palaces and mansions there enfold<br>
 A temple of the gods, that stands within<br>
 'Mid feathery palms and <i>gesdin</i>, <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_248"><font size="1">1</font></a> bowers green,<br>
 The city rises to a dizzy height,<br>
 With jewelled turrets flashing in the light,<br>
 Grand mansions piled on mansions rising high<br>
 Until the glowing summits reach the sky.<br>
 A cloud of myriad wings, e'er fills the sky,<br>
 As doves around their nests on earth here fly;<br>
 The countless millions of the souls on earth,<br>
 The gods have brought to light from mortal birth,<br>
 Are carried there from the dark world of doom;<br>
 For countless numbers more there still is room.<br>
 Through trailing vines my Love and I oft wind,<br>
 With arms of love around each other twined.<br>
 This day, we passed along the Stream of Life,<br>
 Through blooming gardens, with sweet odors rife;<br>
 Beneath the ever-ripening fruits we walk,<br>
 Along dear paths, and sweetly sing, or talk,<br>
 While warbling birds around us fly in view,<br>
 From bloom to bloom with wings of every hue;<br>
 And large-eyed deer, no longer wild, us pass,<br>
 With young gazelles, and kiss each other's face.<br>
 We now have reached the stately stairs of gold,<br>
 The city of the gods, here built of old.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p>
 <p>The pearlèd pillars rise inlaid divine,<br>
 With lotus delicately traced with vine<br>
 In gold and diamonds, pearls, and unknown gems,<br>
 That wind to capital with blooming stems<br>
 Of lilies, honeysuckles, and the rose.<br>
 An avenue of columns in long rows<br>
 Of varied splendor, leads to shining courts<br>
 Where skilful spirit hands with perfect arts<br>
 Have chiselled glorious forms magnificent,<br>
 With ornate skill and sweet embellishment.<br>
 Their golden sculpture view on every hand,<br>
 Or carvèd images in pearl that stand<br>
 In clusters on the floor, or in long rows;<br>
 And on the walls of purest pearl there glows<br>
 The painting of each act of kindest deed<br>
 Each soul performs on earth;--is there portrayed.</p>
 <p>The scenes of tenderness and holy love,<br>
 There stand and never end, but onward move,<br>
 And fill the galleries of Heaven with joy,<br>
 And ever spirit artist hands employ.<br>
 The holiest deeds are carved in purest gold,<br>
 Or richest gems, and there are stored of old;<br>
 Within the inner court a fountain stood,<br>
 Of purest diamond moulded, whence there flowed<br>
 Into a golden chalice,--trickling cool,<br>
 The nectar of the gods,--a sparkling pool,<br>
 That murmuring sank beneath an emerald vase<br>
 That rested underneath;--the fountain's base.</p>
 <p>We entered then an arcade arching long<br>
 Through saph'rine galleries, and heard the song<br>
 That swelling came from temples hyaline;<br>
 And passed through lazite courts and halls divine,<br>
 While dazzling glories brighter round us shone.<br>
 How sweet then came the strains! with grander tone!<br>
 And, oh, my King! I reached the gates of pearl<br>
 That stood ajar, and heard the joyous whirl<br>
 That thrilled the sounding domes and lofty halls,<br>
 And echoed from the shining jasper walls.</p>
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a></p>
 <p>I stood within the gate, and, oh, my friend,<br>
 Before that holy sight I prone did bend,<br>
 And hid my face upon the jacinth stairs.<br>
 A shining god raised me, and bade my fears<br>
 Be flown, and I beheld the glorious throne<br>
 Of crystaled light; with rays by man unknown.<br>
 The awful god there sat with brows sublime,<br>
 With robes of woven gold, and diadem<br>
 That beamed with blazing splendor o'er his head.<br>
 I thus beheld the god with presence dread,<br>
 The King of Kings, the Ancient of the Days,<br>
 While music rose around with joyous praise.<br>
 With awful thunders how they all rejoice!<br>
 And sing aloud with one commingled voice!</p>
 <p>What happiness it was to me, my King!<br>
 From bower to temple I went oft to sing,<br>
 Or spread my wings above the mount divine,<br>
 And viewed the fields from heights cerulean.<br>
 Those songs still linger on dear memory's ear,<br>
 And tireless rest upon me, ever cheer.<br>
 But from the Happy Fields, alas! I woke,<br>
 And from my sight the Heavenly vision broke;<br>
 But, oh, my King, it all was but a dream!<br>
 I hope the truth is such, as it did seem<br>
 If it is true that such a Heavenly Land<br>
 Exists with happiness so glorious, grand,<br>
 Within that haven I would happy be!<br>
 But it, alas! is now denied to me.<br>
 For, oh, my King, to Hades I must go,<br>
 My wings unfold to fly to Realms of Woe;<br>
 In darkness to that other world unknown,<br>
 Alas! from joyous earth my life has flown.</p>
 <p>Farewell, my King, my love thou knowest well;<br>
 I go the road; in Hades soon shall dwell;<br>
 To dwelling of the god Irkalla fierce,<br>
 To walls where light for me can never pierce,<br>
 The road from which no soul may e'er return,<br>
 Where dust shall wrap me round, my body urn,</p>
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a></p>
 <p>Where sateless ravens float upon the air,<br>
 Where light is never seen, or enters there,<br>
 Where I in darkness shall be crowned with gloom;<br>
 With crownèd heads of earth who there shall come<br>
 To reign with Anu's favor or great Bel's,<br>
 Then sceptreless are chained in their dark cells<br>
 With naught to drink but Hades' waters there,<br>
 And dream of all the past with blank despair.<br>
 Within that world, I too shall ceaseless moan,<br>
 Where dwell the lord and the unconquered one,<br>
 And seers and great men dwell within that deep,<br>
 With dragons of those realms we all shall sleep;<br>
 Where King Etana <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">1</font></a> and god Ner doth reign<br>
 With Allat, the dark Under-World's great queen,<br>
 Who reigns o'er all within her regions lone,<br>
 The Mistress of the Fields, her mother, prone<br>
 Before her falls, and none her face withstands<br>
 But I will her approach, and take her hands,<br>
 And she will comfort me in my dread woe.<br>
 Alas! through yonder void I now must go!<br>
 My hands I spread! as birds with wings I fly!<br>
 Descend! descend! beneath that awful sky!<br>
 The seer falls in the arms of Izdubar,<br>
 And he is gone;--'tis clay remaineth here,</p>
 <p>
