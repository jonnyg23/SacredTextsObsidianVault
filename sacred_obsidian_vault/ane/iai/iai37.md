 <h3 align="CENTER">ESCAPE OF TAMMUZ FROM HADES--HIS DEATH IN THE CLOUDS-FUNERAL PROCESSION OF THE GODS-ISHTAR'S ELEGY OVER THE DEATH OF TAMMUZ--HIS REVIVAL IN HADES, WHERE HE IS CROWNED AS THE LORD OF HADES--ISHTAR'S RETURN BRINGS LIGHT AND LOVE BACK TO EARTH.</h3>
 <p>But see! they pass from those dark gates and walls,<br>
 And fly upon the breeze from Hades' halls,<br>
 Hark! hark! the sounding harp is stilled! it falls<br>
 From Tammuz's hands! Oh, how its wailing calls<br>
 To you bright <i>zi-ni</i> <a name="fr_238"></a><a href="#fn_235"><font size="1">1</font></a> flying through the skies,<br>
 See! one sweet spirit of the wind swift flies<br>
 And grasps the wailing harp before it ends<br>
 Its wail of woe, and now beneath it bends,<br>
 With silent pinions listening to its strings,<br>
 Wild sobbing on the winds;--with wailing rings<br>
 The conscious harp, and trembles in her hands.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>
 <p>A rush of pinions comes from myriad lands,<br>
 With moanings sends afar the awful tale,<br>
 And mourners brings with every whispering gale.<br>
 And see! the queen's companion fainting sinks!<br>
 She lays him on that cloud with fleecy brinks!<br>
 And oh! his life is ebbing fast away!<br>
 She wildly falls upon his breast, and gray<br>
 Her face becomes with bitter agony.<br>
 She tearless kneels, wrapt in her misery<br>
 And now upon his breast she lays her head,<br>
 With tears that gods, alas! with men must shed;<br>
 She turning, sobs to her sweet waiting maids,<br>
 Who weeping o'er her stand with bended heads:<br>
 "Assemble, oh, my maids, in mourning here,<br>
 The gods! and spirits of the earth bring near!"</p>
 <p>They come! they come! three hundred spirits high,<br>
 The heavenly spirits come! the I-gi-gi!<br>
 From Heaven's streams and mouths and plains and vales,<br>
 And gods by thousands on the wings of gales.<br>
 The spirits of the earth, An-un-na-ci,<br>
 Now join around their sisters of the sky.<br>
 Hark! hear her weeping to the heavenly throng,<br>
 Imploring them to chant their mournful song:</p>
 <p>"With your gold lyres, the dirge, oh, sing with me!<br>
 And moan with me, with your sweet melody;<br>
 With swelling notes, as zephyrs softly wail,<br>
 And cry with me as sobbing of the gale.<br>
 O Earth! dear Earth! oh, wail with thy dead trees!<br>
 With sounds of mountain torrents, moaning seas!<br>
 And spirits of the lakes, and streams, and vales,<br>
 And Zi-ku-ri of mountains' track-less trail,<br>
 join our bright legions with your queen! Oh, weep<br>
 With your sad tears, dear spirits of the deep!<br>
 Let all the mournful sounds of earth be heard,<br>
 The breeze hath carried stored from beast and bird;<br>
 Join the sweet notes of doves for their lost love<br>
 To the wild moans of hours,--wailing move;<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>
 <p>Let choirs of Heaven and of the earth then peal,<br>
 All living beings my dread sorrow feel!<br>
 Oh, come with saddest, weirdest melody,<br>
 join earth and sky in one sweet threnody!"</p>
 <p>Ten thousand times ten thousand now in line,<br>
 In all the panoplies of gods divine;<br>
 A million crowns are shining in the light,<br>
 A million sceptres, robes of purest white!<br>
 Ten thousand harps and lutes and golden lyres<br>
 Are waiting now to start the Heavenly choirs.</p>
 <p>And lo! a chariot from Heaven comes,<br>
 While halves rise from yonder sapphire domes;<br>
 A chariot incrusted with bright gems,<br>
 A blaze of glory shines from diadems.<br>
 See! in the car the queen o'er Tammuz bends,<br>
 And nearer the procession slowly wends,<br>
 Her regal diadem with tears is dimmed;<br>
 And her bright form by sorrow is redeemed<br>
 To sweeter, holier beauty in her woe;<br>
 Her tears a halo form and brighter flow.</p>
 <p>Caparisoned with pearls, ten milk-white steeds<br>
 Are harnessed to her chariot that leads;<br>
 On snow-white swans beside her ride her maids,<br>
 They come! through yonder silver cloudy glades!<br>
 Behind her chariot ten sovereigns ride;<br>
 Behind them comes all Heaven's lofty pride,<br>
 On pale white steeds, the chargers of the skies.<br>
 The clouds of snowy pinions rustling rise!<br>
 But hark! what is that strain of melody<br>
 That fills our souls with grandest euphony?<br>
 Hear how it swells and dies upon the breeze!<br>
 To softest whisper of the leaves of trees;<br>
 Then sweeter, grander, nobler, sweeping comes,<br>
 Like myriad lyres that peal through Heaven's domes.<br>
 But, oh! how sad and sweet the notes now come!<br>
 Like music of the spheres that softly hum;<br>
 It rises, falls, with measured melody,</p>
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a></p>
 <p>With saddest notes and mournful symphony.<br>
 From all the universe sad notes repeat<br>
 With doleful strains of woe transcendent, sweet;<br>
 Hush! hear the song! my throbbing heart be still!<br>
 The songs of gods above the heavens fill!</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"Oh, weep with your sweet tears, and mourning chant,<br>
   O'er this dread loss of Heaven's queen.<br>
 With her, O sisters, join your sweetest plaint<br>
   O'er our dear Tammuz, Tammuz slain.<br>
 Come, all ye spirits, with your drooping wings,<br>
 No more to us sweet joy he brings;<br>
               Ah, me, my brother! <a name="fr_239"></a><a href="#fn_236"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>Oh, weep! oh, weep! ye spirits of the air,<br>
   Oh, weep! oh, weep! An-un-na-ci!<br>
 Our own dear queen is filled with dread despair.<br>
   Oh, pour your tears, dear earth and sky,<br>
 Oh, weep with bitter tears, O dear Sedu,<br>
 O'er fearful deeds of Nin-azu;<br>
               Ah, me, my brother!</p>
 <p>Let joy be stilled! and every hope be dead!<br>
   And tears alone our hearts distil.<br>
 My love has gone!--to darkness he has fled;<br>
   Dread sorrow's cup for us, oh, fill!<br>
 And weep for Tammuz we have held so dear,<br>
 Sweet sisters of the earth and air;<br>
               Ah, me, my sister!</p>
 <p>Oh, come ye, dearest, dearest Zi-re-nu,<br>
   With grace and mercy help us bear<br>
 Our loss and hers; our weeping queen, oh, see!<br>
   And drop with us a sister's tear.<br>
 Before your eyes our brother slain! oh, view;<br>
 Oh, weep with us o'er him so true;<br>
               Ah, me, his sister!</p>

 <p>The sky is dead; its beauty all is gone,<br>
   Oh, weep, ye clouds, for my dead love!<br>
 Your queen in her dread sorrow now is prone.<br>
   O rocks and hills in tears, oh, move!<br>
 And all my heavenly flowerets for me weep,<br>
 O'er him who now in death doth sleep;<br>
                 Ah, me, my Tammuz!</p>
 <p>Oh, drop o'er him your fragrant dewy tears,<br>
   For your own queen who brings you joy,<br>
 For Love, the Queen of Love, no longer cheers,<br>
   Upon my heart it all doth cloy.<br>
 Alas! I give you love, nor can receive,<br>
 O all my children for me grieve;<br>
                 Ah, me, my Tammuz!</p>
 <p>Alas! alas! my heart is dying--dead!<br>
   With all these bitter pangs of grief<br>
 Despair hath fallen on my queenly head,<br>
   Oh, is there, sisters, no relief?<br>
 Hath Tammuz from me ever, ever, gone?<br>
 My heart is dead, and turned to stone;<br>
                 Ah, me, his queen!</p>
 <p>My sister spirits, O my brothers dear,<br>
   My sorrow strikes me to the earth;<br>
 Oh, let me die! I now no fate can fear,<br>
   My heart is left a fearful dearth.<br>
 Alas, from me all joy! all joy! hath gone;<br>
 Oh, Ninazu, what hast thou done?<br>
                 Ah, me, his queen!"</p></dir>

 <p>To Hades' world beyond our sight they go,<br>
 And leave upon the skies Mar-gid-da's <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">2</font></a> glow,<br>
 That shines eternally along the sky,<br>
 The road where souls redeemed shall ever fly.<br>
 Prince Tammuz now again to life restored,<br>
 Is crowned in Hades as its King and Lord, <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>

 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>
 <p>And Ishtar's sorrow thus appeased, she flies<br>
 To earth, and fills with light and love the skies.</p>
