 <h3 align="CENTER">HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT OF THE RIVAL GIANTS--DEATH OF KHUMBABA</h3>
 <p>Now the black forest through, the Sar and seer<br>
 Sought for their foe, Khumbaba, far and near;<br>
 But he had fled when he beheld the gods<br>
 In fury rushing from their bright abodes.<br>
 Now from the battle-field the King and seer<br>
 The farthest limit of the forest near,<br>
 And passing on, the Sar thus to his seer:<br>
 "The gods have filled our foeman's heart with fear:<br>
 He comes not forth to meet us 'neath his walls."<br>
 But lo! within their sight, far from his halls,<br>
 Khumbaba stands beside his steed of snow<br>
 Held by his queen, and eyes his coming foe.<br>
 Heabani cries: "Behold the enemy!<br>
 And with his queen from us disdains to fly!"</p>
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76</font></a></p>
 <p>And Izdubar turned to Heabani, said:<br>
 "My seer, methought this King from us had fled;<br>
 His army slain or scattered from us fly;<br>
 But by our hands this monarch here must die."<br>
 Heabani eyed Khumbaba, nor replied<br>
 Before the Queen, who wrung her hands and cried;<br>
 And Izdubar continued:<br>
                             "He, of war,<br>
 It seems, doth lack in skill, and from afar<br>
 He scents the battle, while his fighting men<br>
 Their raids oft make, and here return again;<br>
 His castle we may enter without fear,<br>
 And thou his queen mayst have who standeth here,<br>
 And now we end the reign of Elam's throne;<br>
 So lend thy hand to strike this monarch prone.<br>
 My friend, if I mistake thee not, for war<br>
 Thou art prepared, since thou upon the car<br>
 Wast wont to ride in former years now gone;<br>
 And if he falls, a feast day of the Sun<br>
  <a name="fr_207"></a><a href="#fn_205"><font size="1">1</font></a>We will appoint, and may the birds of prey<br>
 Surround his carcass on this glorious day:<br>
 But stay! this giant I will slay alone,<br>
 Although his weight is many <i>gur-ri</i> <a name="fr_208"></a><a href="#fn_206"><font size="1">2</font></a> stone;<br>
 This giant's form the gods have surely made<br>
 An enemy well worthy of my blade."</p>
 <p>And Izdubar upon his foe advanced,<br>
 Who waiting stood, and at him fiercely glanced,<br>
 And naught replied; but raised his glory blade.<br>
 Their furious glance, the giant's queen dismayed.<br>
 She wildly eyed the rivals towering high,<br>
 And breathless stood, then quickly turned to fly,<br>
 As Izdubar upon his heavy shield<br>
 Received Khumbaba's stroke, and then doth wield<br>
 His massive blade as lightning o'er his head,<br>
 He strikes the giant's helmet on the mead.<br>
 Khumbaba, furious, strikes a mighty blow,<br>
 Which staggers Izdubar, who on his foe</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p>
 <p>Now springs and rains upon him faster blows,<br>
 Until his blade with fire continuous glows.<br>
 Khumbaba caught his blows on sword and shield<br>
 With parries; thrusts returned, and naught would yield;<br>
 And thus they fought, the peerless kings of war.<br>
 Now Ishtar downward drove his raging car,<br>
 And in Khumbaba's eyes her rays she cast,<br>
 The giant turned his glance--it was his last;<br>
 Unwary caught, his foe has swung his sword,<br>
 Khumbaba's gory head rolls o'er the sward.</p>
