 <h3 align="CENTER">KHASISADRA ON THE SHORE SEES THE VESSEL COMING, AND RETURNING TO HIS PALACE, SENDS HIS DAUGHTER MUA TO WELCOME IZDUBAR--MEETING OF THE KING AND SAGE</h3>
 <p>Beneath a ku-tree Khasisadra eyes<br>
 The spreading sea beneath the azure skies,<br>
 An agèd youth with features grave, serene,<br>
 Matured with godly wisdom; ne'er was seen<br>
 Such majesty, nor young, nor old,--a seer<br>
 In purpose high. The countenance no fear<br>
 Of death has marred, but on his face sublime<br>
 The perfect soul has left its seal through time.</p>
 <p>"Ah, yes! the dream was clear, the vision true,<br>
 I saw him on the ship! Is it in view?<br>
 A speck! Ah, yes! He comes! he comes to me<br>
 My son from Erech comes across the sea!"<br>
 Back to his palace goes the holy seer,<br>
 And Mua <a name="fr_280"></a><a href="#fn_277"><font size="1">1</font></a> sends, who now the shore doth near;<br>
 As beautiful as Waters of the Dawn,<br>
 Comes Mua here, as graceful as a fawn.</p>
 <p>The King now standing on the glistening sand,<br>
 Beholds the beauteous Mua where she stands,<br>
 With hands outstretched in welcome to the King,<br>
 "O thou sweet spirit, with thy snowy wing,<br>
 Oh, where is Khasisadra in this land?<br>
 I seek the aid of his immortal hand."<br>
 "Great Sar," said Mua, "hadst thou not a seer,<br>
 That thou shouldst come to seek my father here?"</p>
 <p>"'Tis true, my daughter dear, a seer had I,<br>
 Whom I have lost,--a dire calamity;<br>
 By his advice and love I undertake<br>
 This journey. But alas! for mine own sake<br>
 He fell by perils on this lengthened way;<br>
 He was not strong, and feared that he should lay<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p>Himself to rest amid the mountains wild.<br>
 He was a warrior, with him I killed<br>
 Khumbaba, Elam's king who safely dwelt<br>
 Within a forest vast of pines, and dealt<br>
 Destruction o'er the plains. We razed his walls--<br>
 My friend at last before me dying falls.</p>
 <p>Alas! why did my seer attempt to slay<br>
 The dragons that we met upon the way,<br>
 He slew his foe, and like a lion died.<br>
 Ah, me! the cause, when I the gods defied,<br>
 And brought upon us all this awful woe;<br>
 In sorrow o'er his death, my life must flow!<br>
 For this I came to find the ancient seer,<br>
 Lead me to him, I pray, if he lives here."</p>
 <p>Then Mua leads him through the glorious land<br>
 Of matchless splendor, on the border grand<br>
 Of those wide Happy Fields that spread afar<br>
 O'er beaming hills and vales, where ambient air<br>
 With sweetest zephyrs sweeps a grand estrade,<br>
 Where softest odors from each flowering glade<br>
 Lull every sense aswoon that breathes not bliss<br>
 And harmony with World of Blessedness.<br>
 'Neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way,<br>
 Through paths of flowers where night hath fled away,<br>
 A wilderness of varied crystal flowers,<br>
 Where fragrance rests o'er clustering, shining bowers.<br>
 Each gleaming cup its nectared wine distils,<br>
 For spirit lips each chalice ever fills.</p>
 <p>Beyond the groves a lucent palace shone<br>
 In grandest splendor near an inner zone;<br>
 In amethyst and gold divinely rose,<br>
 With glories scintillant the palace glows.<br>
 A dazzling halo crowns its lofty domes,<br>
 And spreading from its summit softly comes<br>
 With grateful rays, and floods the balustrades<br>
 And golden statues 'neath the high arcades;<br>
 A holy palace built by magic hand<br>
 With wondrous architecture, portals grand,<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>
 <p>And aurine turrets piled to dizzy heights,<br>
 Oh, how its glory Izdubar delights!</p>
 <p>Beneath majestic arcades carved, they pass,<br>
 Up golden steps that shine like polished glass,<br>
 Through noble corridors with sculptured walls,<br>
 By lofty columns, archways to the halls<br>
 Of glories, the bright harbinger of fanes<br>
 Of greater splendor of the Heavenly plains.<br>
 Beneath an arch of gems the King espies<br>
 A form immortal, he who death defies.<br>
 Advancing forth the sage his welcome gives,<br>
 "'Tis Izdubar who comes to me and lives!"<br>
 Embracing him he leads him in a room,<br>
 Where many a curious graven tablet, tome,<br>
 And scrolls of quaint and old forgotten lore<br>
 Have slept within for centuries of yore.<br>
 The tablets high are heaped, the alcoves full,<br>
 Where truth at last has found a welcome goal.<br>
 In wisdom's room, the sage his guest has led,<br>
 And seats him till the banquet high is spread;<br>
 Of Izdubar he learns his journeys great,<br>
 How he for aid has left his throne of state.</p>
 <p>The maid now comes, him welcomes to the hall<br>
 Of banquets, where are viands liberal,<br>
 And fruits, immortal bread, celestial wines<br>
 Of vintage old; and when the hero dines,<br>
 They lead him to his private chamber room<br>
 That overlooks the wondrous garden's bloom<br>
 Across the plain and jasper sea divine,<br>
 To Heaven's mountains rising sapphirine.<br>
 Four beauteous streams of liquid silver lead<br>
 Across the plain; the shining sea they feed;<br>
 The King reclines upon his couch at rest,<br>
 With dreams of happiness alone is blest.</p>
