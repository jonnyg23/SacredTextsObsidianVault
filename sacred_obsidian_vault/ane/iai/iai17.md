 <h3 align="CENTER">THE TWO MAIDENS ENTICE THE SEER</h3>
 <p>Thus in Heabani's cave the maiden went,<br>
 And o'er the sleeping seer her form she bent;<br>
 O'er him who with gazelles oft eats his food;<br>
 O'er him who drinks with <i>bhu-ri</i> <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">1</font></a> in the wood;<br>
 O'er him who loves the <i>zir-ri</i>,--of them dreams,<br>
 And sports with them within the mountain streams.<br>
 And when the gay enticer saw the seer<br>
 Unconscious sleeping with sweet joy so near,<br>
 She clasped him to her breast and kissed his brow.<br>
 The seer awakes, with wonder eyes her now:<br>
 "Thy glory thou hast brought to me!" he saith,<br>
 "Sweet Zir-ru comes to me with fragrant breath!"<br>
 And with delight he eyes her beauteous form,<br>
 His breast warm moved by the enticer's charm.<br>
 He springs upon his feet and her pursues:<br>
 She laughing flees; to sport with him doth choose.</p>
 <p>And now he eyes his hairy body, arms<br>
 Compared to Sam-kha's snowy god-like charms,<br>
 She give to him her freshness, blooming youth?<br>
 She laughing comes again to him,--Forsooth!<br>
 Her glorious arms she opens, flees away,<br>
 While he doth follow the enticer gay.<br>
 He seizes, kisses, takes away her breath,<br>
 And she falls to the ground--perhaps in death<br>
 He thinks, and o'er her leans where she now lay;<br>
 At last she breathes, and springs, and flees away.<br>
 But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues;<br>
 But glancing back his arms she doth refuse.<br>
 And thus three days and four of nights she played;<br>
 For of Heabani's love she was afraid.<br>
 Her joyous company doth him inspire<br>
 For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and wild desire.<br>
 He was not satisfied unless her form<br>
 Remained before him with her endless charm.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p>But when his <i>bhu-ri</i> of the field the sight<br>
 Beheld, the wild gazelles fled in affright.<br>
 And now without the cave they came in view<br>
 Of Zaidu waiting with sweet Kharim-tu,</p>
 <p>And when Heabani saw the rounded form<br>
 Of bright Kharim-tu, her voluptuous charm<br>
 Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate<br>
 With wistful face, resigned to any fate.<br>
 Kharim-tu, smiling sweetly, bent her head,<br>
 Enticing him the tempter coyly said,<br>
 "Heabani, like a famous god thou art,<br>
 Why with these creeping things doth sleep thy heart?<br>
 Come thou with me to Erech Su-bu-ri <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
 To Anu's temple Elli-tar-du-si,<br>
 And Ishtar's city where great Izdubar<br>
 Doth reign, the glorious giant king of war;<br>
 Whose mighty strength above his chiefs doth tower,<br>
 Come see our giant king of matchless power."<br>
 Her flashing eyes half languid pierce the seer,<br>
 Until his first resolves all disappear.<br>
 And rising to his feet his eyes he turned<br>
 Toward sweet Joy, <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">3</font></a> whose love for him yet burned;<br>
 And eyeing both with beaming face he saith,<br>
 "With Sam-kha's love the seer hath pledged his faith;<br>
 And I will go to Elli-tar-du-si,<br>
 Great Anu's seat and Ishtar's where with thee,<br>
 I will behold the giant Izdubar,<br>
 Whose fame is known to me as king of war;<br>
 And I will meet him there, and test the power<br>
 Of him whose fame above all men doth tower.<br>
 A <i>mid-dan-nu</i> <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">4</font></a> to Erech I will take,<br>
 To see if he its mighty strength can break.<br>
 In these wild caves its strength has mighty grown;<br>
 If he the beast destroys, I will make known<br>
 His dream to him--e'en all the seer doth know;<br>
 And now with thee to Erech I will go.</p>
