 <h3 align="CENTER">FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF HEABANI, WHO ARRIVES AT ERECH--INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM</h3>
 <p>The sounds of wild rejoicing now arise;<br>
 "Heabani comes!" resound the joyful cries,<br>
 And through the gates of Erech Suburi<br>
 Now file the chieftains, Su-khu-li rubi. <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">1</font></a><br>
 A festival in honor of their guest<br>
 The Sar proclaims, and Erech gaily drest,<br>
 Her welcome warm extends to the famed seer.<br>
 The maidens, Erech's daughters, now appear,<br>
 With richest kirtles gaily decked with flowers,<br>
 And on his head they rain their rosy showers.<br>
 Rejoicing sing, while harps and cymbals play,<br>
 And laud him to the skies in their sweet way;<br>
 And mingling with their joy, their monarch rode<br>
 Before the seer, who stately after strode<br>
 Beside his beast, and next the men of fame.<br>
 The maids thus chant high honors to his name:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"A prince we make thee, mighty seer!<br>
 Be filled with joy and royal cheer!<br>
           All hail to Erech's seer!</p>
 <p>Whom day and night our Sar hath sought,<br>
 O banish fear! for Hea taught<br>
           The seer, his glory wrought.</p>
 <p>He comes! whom Samas loves as gold,<br>
 To Erech grace, our city old;<br>
           All wisdom he doth hold.</p>
 <p>Great Hea doth to him unfold<br>
 All that remains to man untold;<br>
           Give him the chain of gold!</p>
 <p>He cometh from the Za-Gab-ri<br>
 To our dear Erech Su-bu-ri.<br>
           Heabani glorify!</p>

 <p>Thy dream he will reveal, O Sar!<br>
 Its meaning show to Izdubar,<br>
           Victorious king of war."</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>Within the council halls now lead the seers<br>
 With trepidation and with many fears,<br>
 To hear the seer explain their monarch's dream.<br>
 Beside the royal throne he sits supreme<br>
 Among the seers, the Sar, his scribe commands<br>
 To read his dream recorded as it stands<br>
 In Erech's Gi; <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">2</font></a> who reads it to the seer,<br>
 Who answers thus:<br>
                        "In this there doth appear<br>
 A god, whose ardent love will lead to deeds<br>
 Of hate against thee, Sar; thy present needs<br>
 Are great, O king! as fire this love will burn<br>
 Until the wicked seven <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">3</font></a> on thee turn;<br>
 And blood, alone, will not their fury sate:<br>
 The gods will hurl upon thee some dread fate."<br>
 In silence, Izdubar the warning heard;<br>
 His blood with terror froze, and then was stirred<br>
 By passions wild, when he recalled the scene<br>
 Of Ishtar's love for him by man unseen;<br>
 When she so wildly then proclaimed her love;<br>
 And now with hate his utmost soul doth move,<br>
 And her bright form to a black dal-khu <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">4</font></a> turned<br>
 And furious passions on his features burned.<br>
 And then of the first dream he thought, and light<br>
 Across his vision broke:<br>
                            "'Tis true! aright<br>
 Thy seer hath read! for Ishtar came to me<br>
 In the first dream, her face e'en yet I see!<br>
 Aye, more! her lips to mine again then fell!<br>
 Her arms I felt around me,--breath too well<br>
 I know! of fragrance, while perfume arose<br>
 Around my dream and fled not at the close;<br>
 As frankincense and myrrh it lingered, when<br>
 I woke. Ah yes! the queen will come again!"</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>
 <p>Then to his counsellor who wondering stood,<br>
 Nor heard his murmuring, but saw subdued<br>
 His features were, at first, and then, they grand<br>
 Became with settled hate; he raised his hand;<br>
 "'Tis true!" he said, "Reward oil him bestow!<br>
 Then to the waiting feast we all shall go."</p>
