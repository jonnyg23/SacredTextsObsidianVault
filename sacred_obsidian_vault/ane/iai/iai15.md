 <h3 align="CENTER">SONGS IN PRAISE OF IZDUBAR AND HEABANI AS SUNG BY THE KHAU-IK-I</h3><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Our Izdubar dear Erech raised<br>
   From her distress, when she did mourn;<br>
 With joy his glorious name be praised!<br>
   Of a great warrior's daughter born,<br>
 And Bel in his own might, him arms,<br>
   To Erech's sons and daughters save;<br>
 What other Sar hath glorious charms<br>
   Like his, who saved proud Elam's slave?</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Chorus</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>No rival hath our mighty Sar,<br>
   Thy cymbals strike and raise the cry!<br>
 All hail! All hail! great Izdubar!<br>
   His deeds immortal glorify!</p>
 <p>Our Izdubar our sons preserves<br>
   To all our fathers day and night,<br>
 And Erech's ruler well deserves<br>
   Our highest praise, whose matchless might<br>
 Delights the gods! All hail our Sar!<br>
   Whose firmness, wisdom need no praise!<br>
 Queen Daunat's son, our Izdubar,<br>
   His glory to the Sami <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">1</font></a> raise!</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Chorus</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Of a great warrior's daughter born,<br>
   The gods clothe him with matchless might;<br>
 His glory greets the coming morn,<br>
   Oh, how in him we all delight!</p>

 <p>And thus of Seer Heabani they now chant<br>
 His birth and history and hyemal haunt.</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Who can compare with thee, O Nin! <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">2</font></a><br>
   The son of Bel; thy hands didst lay<br>
 Upon Ar-ur-u, thine own queen,<br>
   With glory crowned her on that day.</p>
 <p>To her thy strength did give, and blessed<br>
   Her with thy love and a dear son;<br>
 With Anu's strength within his breast,<br>
   And Ninip sped then to his throne.</p>
 <p>When Queen Ar-u-ru hears her lord<br>
   From Erech's city far has gone,<br>
 She bows her head upon the sward,<br>
   With pleading hands in woe doth moan.</p>
 <p>And to Heabani she gave birth,<br>
   The warrior, great Ninip's son,<br>
 Whose fame is spread through all the earth.<br>
   The queen with her own maids alone<br>
 Retired within her palace walls<br>
   For purity in Erech's halls.</p>
 <p>Like the corn-god his face concealed,<br>
   Of men and countries he possessed,<br>
 Great wisdom by the gods revealed:<br>
   As Ner <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">3</font></a> the god, his limbs were dressed.<br>
 With wild gazelles he ate his food<br>
   While roaming with them in the night;<br>
 For days he wandered in the wood,<br>
   And bu-hir-tser-i <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">4</font></a> him delight.</p>
 <p>The Zi-ar-ri <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">5</font></a> Heabani loves,<br>
   That play within the running streams;<br>
 With Zi-ti-am-a-ti <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">6</font></a> he roves<br>
   Upon the sands in warm sunbeams.</p>

 <p>"The prince returns, O Sar!" the herald said,<br>
 And low before the throne he bowed his head;<br>
 "Our Zaidu, the bewitcher of all men,<br>
 Doth unsuccessful to us come again.<br>
 Before the cave the seer confronted him<br>
 Three days where Khar-sak's snowy brow doth gleam.<br>
 Heabani with his beast in his cave went,<br>
 And Zaidu waited, but his courage spent<br>
 When he beheld the seer and beast remain<br>
 Within the cave, and all his words were vain.<br>
 The prince remains without with downcast face<br>
 And beg of thee, his Sar, thy sovereign grace."<br>
 The king to all the maidens waves his hand,<br>
 Then vanishes from sight the choral band.</p>
