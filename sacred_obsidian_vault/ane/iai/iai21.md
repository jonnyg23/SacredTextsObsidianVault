 <h3 align="CENTER">COUNCIL IN THE PALACE</h3>
 <p>The seers on silver couches round the throne;<br>
 The hangings of the carvèd lintel thrown<br>
 Aside; the heralds cried: "The Sar! The Sar!<br>
 The council opens our King Izdubar!"<br>
 The Sar walked o'er the velvets to his throne<br>
 Of gold inlaid with gems. A vassal prone<br>
 Before the Sar now placed the stool of gold,<br>
 Arranged his royal robes with glittering fold<br>
 Of laces, fringes rich inwove with pearls,<br>
 Embroidered with quaint figures, curious twirls.<br>
 Behind the throne a prince of royal blood<br>
 Arrayed in courtly splendor, waiting stood,<br>
 And gently waved a jewelled fan aloft<br>
 Above the Sar's tiara; carpets soft<br>
 From Accad's looms the varied tilings bright,<br>
 In tasteful order, part conceal from sight.</p>
 <p>The glittering pillars stand with gold o'erlaid<br>
 In rows throughout the room to the arcade,<br>
 Within the entrance from a columned hall.<br>
 The ivory-graven panels on the wall<br>
 On every side are set in solid gold.<br>
 The canopy chased golden pillars hold<br>
 Above the throne, and emeralds and gems<br>
 Flash from the counsellor's rich diadems.<br>
 In silence all await the monarch's sign:<br>
 "This council hath been called, the hour is thine<br>
 To counsel with thy King upon a plan<br>
 Of conquest of our foes, who ride this plain,<br>
 Unchecked around; these Suti should be driven<br>
 From Sumir's plain. Have ye our wrongs forgiven?</p>
 <p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 62</font></a></p>
 <p>Khumbaba hath enjoyed great Accad's spoils<br>
 Too long; with him we end these long turmoils.<br>
 What sayest thou, Heabani?--all my seers?<br>
 Hath Accad not her chariots and spears?"</p>
 <p>Then one among the wisest seers arose<br>
 "To save our precious tune which hourly flows,<br>
 He should our seer, Rab-sak-i <a name="fr_191"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">1</font></a> first invite<br>
 To lay his plans before the Sar, and light<br>
 May break across our vision. I confess<br>
 Great obstacles I see, but acquiesce<br>
 In any plan you deem may bring success.<br>
 The gods, I feel our cause will gladly bless."<br>
 Another spoke, and all agree at last<br>
 To hear the seer whose wisdom all surpassed.</p>
 <p>Heabani modestly arose and said,<br>
 And gracefully to all inclined his head:<br>
 "O Sar! thy seer will gladly counsel give<br>
 To thee, and all our seers; my thanks receive<br>
 For thy great confidence in my poor skill<br>
 To crush our foes who every country fill.<br>
 I with the Sar agree that we should strike<br>
 A blow against the rival king, who like<br>
 Our Sar, is a great giant king, and lives<br>
 Within a mountain castle, whence he grieves<br>
 All nations by his tyranny, and reigns<br>
 With haughty power from Kharsak to these plains.<br>
 I'll lead the way, my Sar, to his wild home;<br>
 'Tis twenty <i>kas-pu</i> <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">2</font></a> hence, if you will come.<br>
 A wall surrounds his castle in a wood,<br>
 With brazen gates strong fastened. I have stood<br>
 Beneath the lofty pines which dwindle these<br>
 To shrubs that grow in parks as ornate trees.<br>
 The mighty walls will reach six <i>gars</i> <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_191"><font size="1">3</font></a> in height,<br>
 And two in breadth, like Nipur's <a name="fr_194"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">4</font></a> to the sight.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p>
 <p>And when you go, take with you many mules;<br>
 With men to bring the spoils, and needed tools<br>
 To break the gates, his castle overthrow:<br>
 To lose no time, to-morrow we should go.<br>
 To Erech, pines and cedars we can bring<br>
 With all the wealth of Elam's giant king,<br>
 And Erech fill with glorious parks and halls,<br>
 Remove these <i>man-u-bani</i>, <a name="fr_195"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">5</font></a> ruined walls.<br>
 Take to your hearts, ye seers, poor Erech's wrongs!<br>
 Her fall, the bards of Elam sing in songs.<br>
 I love dear Erech, may her towers shine!<br>
 He seized his harp, thus sung the seer divine:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>"O Erech! thy bright plains I love;<br>
 Although from thee thy seer did rove,<br>
        My heart remained with thee!<br>
 The foe destroyed thy beauteous towers,<br>
 Sa-mu forgot to rain her showers,<br>
        And could I happy be?</p>
 <p>Mine eyes beheld thy fallen gates,<br>
 Thy blood warm flowing in thy streets,<br>
        My heart was broken then.<br>
 I raised mine eyes and saw thy Sar<br>
 In glory on his steed of war,<br>
        And joy returned again!</p>
 <p>I saw the foe in wild dismay<br>
 Before him flee that glorious day.<br>
        With joy I heard the cry<br>
 Of victory resound afar,<br>
 Saw Elam crushed 'neath Accad's car:<br>
        I shouted, Victory!</p>
 <p>Away! till birds of prey shall rend<br>
 His flesh and haughty Elam bend<br>
        Before our mighty Sar!<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a></p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Beneath his forest of pine-trees<br>
 The battle-cry then loudly raise,<br>
        We follow Izdubar!</p>
 <p>And may the birds of prey surround<br>
 Khumbaba stretched upon the ground,<br>
        Destroy his body there!<br>
 And Izdubar alone be king,<br>
 And all his people joyful sing,<br>
        With glory crown him here!</p>
 <p>All hail! All hail! our giant King,<br>
 The <i>amaranti</i> <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_194"><font size="1">6</font></a> for him bring,<br>
        To crown him, crown him here,<br>
 As King of Accad and Sutu,<br>
 And all the land of Subar-tu!<br>
        So sayeth Hea's seer!"</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>The cuunsellors and chieftains wildly cry<br>
 Around the throne, "All hail <i>izzu sar-ri</i><br>
 Of Su-bar-tu!" and shouting leave the halls<br>
 To summon Accad's soldiers from the walls<br>
 To hear the war proclaimed against their foes,<br>
 And Accad's war-cry from them loud arose.<br>
 King Izdubar Heabani warmly prest<br>
 Within his arms upon his throbbing breast,<br>
 And said, "Let us to the war temple go,<br>
 That all the gods their favor may bestow."<br>
 The seer replied, "'Tis well! then let us wend<br>
 Our way, and at the altar we will bend,--<br>
 To Ishtar's temple, where our goddess queen<br>
 Doth reign, seek her propitious favor, then<br>
 In Samas' holy temple pray for aid<br>
 To crush our foe;--with glory on each blade,<br>
 Our hands will carry victory in war."<br>
 The chiefs, without the temple, join their Sar.</p>
