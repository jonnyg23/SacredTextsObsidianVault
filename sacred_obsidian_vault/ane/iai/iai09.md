 <h3 align="CENTER">THE KING'S SECOND DREAM AND EARLY RIDE UPON SUMIR'S PLAIN, AND HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT ON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES</h3>
 <p>The night is fleeing from the light of dawn,<br>
 Which dimly falls upon the palace lawn;<br>
 The King upon his royal <i>dum-khi</i> <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">1</font></a> sleeps,<br>
 And to his couch again Queen Ishtar creeps.<br>
 In spite his dream to dismal thoughts she turns,<br>
 Her victim tosses, now with fever burns:<br>
 He wildly starts, and from his <i>dum-khi</i> springs,<br>
 While loud his voice throughout the palace rings:<br>
 "Ho! vassals! haste to me! your King!" he cries,<br>
 And stamping fiercely while, his passions rise.<br>
 The <i>sukh-li</i> <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">2</font></a> and <i>masari</i> <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">3</font></a> rush in:<br>
 "What trouble, Sar? have foes here come within?<br>
 Then searching around they in his chamber rush,<br>
 And eagerly aside the curtains push.<br>
 The King yet paces on the floor with strides<br>
 That show the trouble of his mind, and chides<br>
 Them all as laggards; "Soon the sun will rise:<br>
 My steed prepared bring hence!" he turning cries.<br>
 He mounts and gallops through the swinging gates,<br>
 Nor for attendance of his vassals waits.<br>
 Nor turns his face toward the <i>nam-za-khi</i>, <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">4</font></a><br>
 Who quickly opened for the King to fly<br>
 Without the gates; across the plains he rides<br>
 Away unmindful where his steed he guides.<br>
 The horse's hoofs resound upon the plain<br>
 As the lone horseman with bewildered brain,<br>
 To leave behind the phantoms of the night,<br>
 Rides fiercely through the early morning light,<br>
 Beyond the orange orchards, citron groves,<br>
 'Mid feathery date-palms he reckless roves.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>
 <p>The fields of yellow grain mid fig-trees flash<br>
 Unseen, and prickly pears, pomegranates, dash<br>
 In quick succession by, till the white foam<br>
 From his steed's mouth and quiv'ring flanks doth come;<br>
 Nor heeds the whitened flowing mane, but flies,<br>
 While clouds of dust him follow, and arise<br>
 Behind him o'er the road like black storm clouds,<br>
 While Zu <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">5</font></a> the storm-bird onward fiercely goads<br>
 The seven <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">6</font></a> raven spirits of the air,<br>
 And Nus-ku <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">7</font></a> opens wide the fiery glare<br>
 Of pent-up lightnings for fierce Gibil's <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">8</font></a> hand,<br>
 Who hurls them forth at Nergal's <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">9</font></a> stern command,<br>
 And Rimmon <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">10</font></a> rides triumphant on the air,<br>
 And Ninazu <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">1</font></a> for victims doth prepare,<br>
 The King rides from the road into the wild,<br>
 Nor thought of danger, his stern features smiled<br>
 As the worn steed from a huge lion shied,<br>
 Which turning glanced at them and sprang aside;<br>
 Now Zi-pis-au-ni <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">2</font></a> fly before the King.<br>
 And yellow leopards through the rushes spring.<br>
 Upon Euphrates' banks his steed he reins,<br>
 And views the rosy wilds of Sumir's plains.</p>
 <p>He looked toward the east across the plain<br>
 That stretched afar o'er brake and marshy fen,<br>
 And clustering trees that marked the Tigris' course;<br>
 And now beyond the plain o'er fields and moors,<br>
 The mountain range of Zu <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">3</font></a> o'er Susa's land<br>
 Is glowing 'neath the touch of Samas' hand;<br>
 For his bright face is rising in the east,<br>
 And shifting clouds from sea and rising mist,<br>
 The robes of purple, violet and gold,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>
 <p>With rosy tints the form of Samas fold.<br>
 The tamarisk and scarlet mistletoe,<br>
 With green acacias' golden summits glow,<br>
 And citron, olives, myrtle, climbing vine,<br>
 Arbutus, cypress, plane-tree rise divine;<br>
 The emerald verdure, clad with brilliant lines,<br>
 With rose-tree forests quaffs the morning dews..<br>
 The King delighted bares his troubled brow,<br>
 In Samas' golden rays doth holy bow.<br>
 But see! a shadow steals along the ground!<br>
 And trampling footsteps through the copses sound,<br>
 And Izdubar, his hand placed on his sword,<br>
 Loud cries:<br>
                "Who cometh o'er mine Erech's sward?"<br>
 An armèd warrior before him springs;<br>
 The King, dismounted, his bright weapon swings.<br>
 "'Tis I, Prince Dib-bara, <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">4</font></a> Lord Izdubar,<br>
 And now at last alone we meet in war;<br>
 My soldiers you o'erthrew upon the field,<br>
 But here to Nuk-khu's <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_88"><font size="1">5</font></a> son thine arm shall yield!<br>
 The monarch eyes the warrior evil-born,<br>
 And thus replies to him with bitter scorn:<br>
 "And dost thou think that Samas' son shall die<br>
 By a vile foe who from my host did fly?<br>
 Or canst thou hope that sons of darkness may<br>
 The Heaven-born of Light and glory slay?<br>
 As well mayst hope to quench the god of fire,<br>
 But thou shalt die if death from me desire."<br>
 The giant forms a moment fiercely glared,<br>
 And carefully advanced with weapons bared,<br>
 Which flash in the bright rays like blades of fire,<br>
 And now in parry meet with blazing ire.<br>
 Each firmly stood and rained their ringing blows,<br>
 And caught each stroke upon their blades, till glows<br>
 The forest round with sparks of fire that flew<br>
 Like blazing meteors from their weapons true;</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>
 <p>And towering In their rage they cautious sprung<br>
 Upon each, foiled, while the deep Suk-ha <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_89"><font size="1">6</font></a> rung.<br>
 At last the monarch struck a mighty blow,<br>
 His foeman's shield of gold, his blade cleft through;<br>
 And as the lightning swung again his sword,<br>
 And struck the chieftain's blade upon the sward,<br>
 A Sedu springs from out the tangled copse,<br>
 And at his feet the sword still ringing drops.<br>
 The King his sword placed at his foeman's throat<br>
 And shouted:<br>
                 "Hal-ca <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">7</font></a> to yon waiting boat!<br>
 Or I will send thy body down this stream!<br>
 <i>Ca is-kab-bu! va kal-bu!</i> <a name="fr_91"></a><a href="#fn_91"><font size="1">8</font></a> whence you came!<br>
 The chief disarmed now slunk away surprised,<br>
 And o'er the strength of Sar-dan-nu <a name="fr_92"></a><a href="iai10.htm#fn_92"><font size="1">9</font></a> surmised.<br>
 The King returns, and rides within the gate<br>
 Of Erech, and the council entered late.</p>
