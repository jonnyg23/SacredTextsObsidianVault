 <p><i>'Kālī'</i></p>  
 <p>Dispeller of the fear of Kāla or Death.</p>  
 <p><i>'Whoever'</i></p>  
 <p>Here a Divya Sādhaka.</p>  
 <p><i>'Midday' (Madhyāhne)</i></p>  
 <p>At noon.</p>  
 <p><i>'Devotion' (Premnā)</i></p>  
 <p>That is Parabhakti.</p>  
 <p><i>'Offers' (Vitarati)</i></p>  
 <p>Merges in Thee, that is, attains Nirvikalpa-Samādhi. Pātanjala-Sūtra says that Nirvikalpa-Samādhi is attained by suppression of the Vṛtti of mind.</p>  
 <p><i>'In the cremation-ground' (Citāyām)</i></p>  
 <p>In thee as Consciousness (Cit).</p>  
 <p><i>'Bīja'</i></p>  
 <p>That is here nectar which issues on the enjoyment of the union of Kula-kundalinī and Paramaśiva. The Gandharvamālikā-Tantra says, 'Oh beloved One, the Queen of Devas unites with Paraśiva and</p>

 <p>in a moment, Oh Devī Parameśvari, nectar is forthwith produced. That nectar, Oh Devī, is like the juice of lac. With it, Oh, Mistress of the Devas, libation (Tarpaṇa) should be offered to the supreme Devatā.'</p>

 <p>In the thousand petalled Lotus (Sahasrāra).</p>

 <p><a name="fn_119"></a><a href="htk20.htm#fr_119">80:1</a> <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a> <i>Kālī</i> is destroyer of <i>Kāla</i> (V).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="htk20.htm#fr_120">80:2</a> 'Whoever' is here a <i>Vīra Sādhaka</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_121"></a><a href="htk20.htm#fr_121">80:3</a> <i>Madhyāhne</i>. Noon or (here) midnight, <i>Kakārakūtarahasya</i> says, 'Whoever naked and with dishevelled hair, on a Tuesday, at midnight, does <i>Homa</i> in the cremation-ground with hair, nails, seed and whatever adheres to the <i>Sammārjañī</i> and offers them after having uttered the <i>Mūlamantra</i> and recited Thy name a thousand times attracts to him the Lord of the Earth' (V).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_122"></a><a href="htk20.htm#fr_122">80:4</a> The offering is stated in the words <i>grihe sammārjanyā parigalitabījam hi chikurang samūlang madhyānhe vitarati chitayāng kujadine</i>. These words have received various interpretations, of which the two chief alternatives are given. <i>Gṛhe</i> is by some translated as 'at home,' in distinction from the cremation-ground to which, according to this rendering, the <i>sādhaka</i> subsequently goes to make his offering. This, however, is said to be erroneous, as the <i>sādhanā</i> takes place not in the house but in the cremation-ground. Others (see Calcutta edition) translate it as the equivalent of <i>grihinī</i>, or wife. <i>Sammārjanī</i> is by them read to mean 'comb.' <i>Parigalita</i> is translated 'removed,' in the sense that the curling of the hair of the wife is 'removed' or straightened with the comb. <i>Bijam</i> given either its primary meaning, or as the equivalent of <i>vīrya</i> is said to mean <i>kautilyam</i>, or curl of the hair. <i>Cikuram</i> is hair,' and <i>samūlam</i> qualifies it, meaning pulled out, taken off at the root. The meaning is, then, an offering is made of the wife's hair, the curls (<i>kautilyam</i>) of which have been straightened out with the comb (<i>sammārjanyā</i>), and some of which has come off at the root (<i>samūlam</i>). The correct rendering, however, is according to K. B. <i>Śaktisādhakayoh gṛhe maithunasamaye</i> <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></a> <i>yoniliṁgasaṁgharṣavaśāt śaktiyonipatitaṁ vīryaliptaṁ loma devyai samarpitaṁ bhavati</i>. <i>Gṛhe</i> thus does not mean 'at home,' but <i>manmathagrihe</i>. The hair is from the same. <i>Saṁmārjanī</i> = <i>Śiśna</i>. <i>Samūlaṁ</i> qualifies <i>cikuram</i> in the sense of 'come off at the root' under the circumstances stated. <i>Parigalita</i> is 'dropped'referring to the <i>vīrya</i>.</p>  
 <p>According to <i>Vimalānanda</i>, <i>Gṛhe parigalita-vīryaṁ</i>, is that produced by union with the <i>Sādhaka's</i> <i>svaśakti</i> or wife (V).</p>  
 <p>Of the words <i>Gṛhe saṁmārjanyā parigalita-viryaṁ cikuram samūlaṁ</i> the Commentator Durgārāma Siddāntavāgiśa gives the two following alternative expressions: (<i>a</i>) <i>Sammārjanyā</i> means with a comb with which the hair is put in order. P<i>arigalitavīryam chikuram</i> means hair of which the <i>Vīrya</i> or crookedness has been removed. <i>Gṛhe</i> means in the wife: for it is said the wife is the home. The whole phrase then means Wife's hair, root and all, combed out straight with a comb or (b) <i>Sammārjanyā Parigalita-viryaṁ</i> means <i>Śukra</i> produced by <i>Sammārjanī</i> here meaning <i>Liṅga</i> of the <i>Sādhaka</i>; <i>gṛhe</i> means in the abode of <i>Kāma</i> that is <i>Yoni</i> of <i>Śakti</i> together with hair, root and all.</p>  
 <p>The English translation is somewhat abbreviated with the object of giving only so much as all renderings are agreed upon. But in practice <i>Vīrya</i> is used by most in its literal sense, this is the gross meaning. The inner sense is given in the <i>Svarūpa-vyākhyā</i> which follows.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_123"></a><a href="htk20.htm#fr_123">80:5</a> According to some, the offering is made on the built-up pyre, and, according to others, on the fire after the body has been consumed. <i>Citā</i>, however, is really used as a synonym for the burning ground (<i>Smaśāna</i>). The Niruttara-Tantra (Ch. I) speaks of two Kinds of <i>Smaśāna</i>:</p>  
 <p></p><dir><i>Śmaśānaṁ dvividhaṁ deva citā yonih prakīṛtitaṁ</i>.</dir>  
 <p></p>
 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="htk20.htm#fr_124">80:6</a> That is, he becomes a <i>Rājā</i>, and has no longer to go on foot like common folk.</p>
