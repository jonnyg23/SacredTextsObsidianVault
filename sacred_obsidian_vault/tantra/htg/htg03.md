 <p>SANĀTANA BRAHMAN is called <i>sakala</i> when with <i>Prakṛti</i>, as It is <i>niṣkala</i> when thought of as without <i>Prakṛti</i> (<i>prakṛteranya</i>), for <i>kalā</i> is <i>Prakṛti</i>. <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> To say, however, that Śakti exists in or with, the Brahman is an accommodation to human thought and speech, for the Brahman and Śakti are in fact one. Śakti is eternal (<i>anādirūpā</i>), and <i>Brahmarūpā</i>, and both nirguṇā and <i>saguṇā</i>. <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a> She, the Goddess (<i>Devī</i>), is the <i>caitanyarūpiṇi devī</i> who manifests all <i>bhūta</i>; the <i>ānandarūpiṇi devī</i> by whom the Brahman, who She is, manifests Itself, <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a> and who, to use the words of the Śāradātilaka, pervades the universe as does oil the sesamum seed. "<i>Sa aikṣata</i>," of which <i>Śruti</i> speaks, was itself a manifestation of Śakti, the <i>paramāpūrvanirvāṇaśakti</i>, or Brahman, as Śakti.</p>  
 <p>From the <i>paraśaktimaya</i> issued <i>nāda</i>, and from <i>nāda</i>, <i>bindu</i> <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a>. The state of subtle body known as <i>kāmakalā</i> is the <i>mūla</i> of <i>mantra</i>, and is meant when the Devī is spoken</p>

 <p>of as <i>mūlamantrātmikā</i>. <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">1</font></a> The <i>Parambindu</i> is represented as a circle the centre of which is the <i>Brahmapada</i>, wherein are <i>Prakṛti-puruṣa</i>; the circumference of which is encircling <i>māyā</i>. It is in the crescent of <i>nirvāṇakalā</i> the seventeenth, which is again in that of <i>amākalā</i> the sixteenth, digit of the moon circle (<i>candramaṇḍala</i>), situate above the sun-circle (<i>sūryamaṇdala</i>), the <i>Guru</i> and the <i>Hamsah</i> in the pericarp of the 1,000 petalled lotus (<i>sahasrārapadma</i>). The <i>bindu</i> is symbolically described as being like a grain of gram (<i>canaka</i>), which under its encircling sheath contains a divided seed--<i>Prakṛti-puruṣa</i> or <i>Śakti-Śiva</i>. <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>  
 <p>It is known as the Śabda Brahman. <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">3</font></a> A polarization then takes place in <i>paraśaktimaya</i>. The Devī becomes <i>unmukhi</i>. Her face is turned to Śiva. There is an unfolding which bursts the encircling shell. <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">4</font></a> The <i>devatāparaśaktimaya</i> exists in the threefold aspect of <i>bindu</i>, <i>bīja</i>, and <i>nāda</i>, the last being in relation to the two former. An indistinct sound then arises <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">5</font></a> (<i>avyaktātmāravobhavat</i>). <i>Nāda</i>, as Rāghava Bhatta <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">6</font></a> says, exists in three states, for in it are the three <i>guṇas</i>. The Śabda Brahman manifests Itself in the threefold energies, <i>Jnāna</i>, <i>Ichhā</i>, and <i>Kriyā Śakti</i>. <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">7</font></a> For, as the Vāmakeśvara</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Tantra says, the Devī Tripurā is threefold, as Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Īśa. Paraśiva exists as a septenary under the forms of Śambhu, Śadāśiva, Īśāna, Rudra, Viṣṇu, and Brahmā. The last five are the <i>Mahāpreta</i>, four of whom form the support, and the fifth the seat, of the bed on which the Devī is united with Paramaśiva in the room of <i>cintāmaṇi</i> stone on the jewelled island clad with clumps of kadamba, and heavenly trees set in the ocean of ambrosia. <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Śakti</i> is both <i>māyā</i> and <i>mūlaprakṛti</i>, whose substance is the three <i>guṇas</i>, representing nature as the revelation of spirit (<i>sattva</i>); nature as the passage of descent from spirit to matter, or of ascent from matter to spirit (<i>rajas</i>), and nature as the dense veil of spirit (<i>tamas</i>). The Devī is thus the treasure-house of <i>guṇas</i> (<i>guṇanidhih</i>). <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">2</font></a> <i>Mūlaprakṛti</i> is the womb into which the Brahman casts the seed from which all things are born. <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">3</font></a> The womb thrills to the movement of the essentially active <i>rajoguṇa</i>, and the now unstable <i>guṇas</i> in varied combinations under the illumination of Śiva (<i>cit</i>) evolve the universe which is ruled by Maheśvara and Maheśvarī. The dual principles of Śiva-Śakti, which are the product of the polarity manifested in <i>Paraśaktimaya</i>, pervade the whole universe, and are present in man in the <i>svayambhulinga</i> of the <i>mūlādhāra</i> and the Devī Kuṇḍalinī, who in serpent form encircles it. The <i>Śabdabrahman</i> assumes the form of the Devī Kuṇḍalinī, and as such is in the form of all breathing creatures (<i>prāṇi</i>), and in the form of letters appears in prose and verse. She is the luminous vital energy (<i>jīvaśakti</i>), which manifests as <i>prāṇa</i>. Through the</p>

 <p>various <i>prakṛta</i> and <i>vaikṛta</i> creations, issued the Devas, men, animals, and the whole universe, which is the work and manifested form of the Devī. For, as the Kubjikā Tantra says, "Not Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra create, maintain, and destroy, but Brāhmī, Vaiṣṇavī, Rudrāṇī. Their husbands are but as dead bodies."</p>  
 <p>The Goddess (<i>Devī</i>) is the great Śakti. She is <i>māyā</i>, for of Her the <i>māyā</i> which produces the <i>samsāra</i> is. As Lord of <i>māyā</i>, She is Mahāmāyā. <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">1</font></a> Devī is <i>avidyā</i> (nescience), because She binds; and <i>vidyā</i> (knowledge), because She liberates and destroys the <i>samsāra</i>. <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">2</font></a> She is Prakṛti, <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">3</font></a> and, as existing before creation, She is the <i>ādya</i> (primordial) śakti. She is the <i>vācaka-śakti</i>, the manifestation of <i>cit</i> in Prakṛti; and the <i>vācya śakti</i> or <i>cit</i> itself. The <i>ātmā</i> should be contemplated as Devī. <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>Śakti or Devī is thus the Brahman revealed in its Mother aspect (<i>srīmātā</i>) <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">5</font></a> as creatrix and nourisher of the worlds. Kālī says of Herself in Yoginī Tantra: <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">6</font></a> "<i>Saccidānandarupāham Brahmaivāham sphuratprabham</i>." So the Devī is described with attributes both of the qualified <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">7</font></a> Brahman, and (since that Brahman is but the manifestation of the Absolute), She is also addressed</p>

 <p>with epithets which denote the unconditioned Brahman. <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a> She is the great Mother (<i>ambikā</i>) sprung from the sacrificial hearth of the fire of the Grand Consciousness (<i>cit</i>) decked with the Sun and Moon; Lalitā--"She who plays"--whose play is world-play; whose eyes, playing like fish in the beauteous waters of Her Divine face, open and shut with the appearance and disappearance of countless worlds, now illuminated by Her light, now wrapped in her terrible darkness. <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">2</font></a> For Devī, who issues from the great Abyss, is terrible also in Her Kālī, Tārā, Chinnamastā, and other forms. Śāktas hold that a sweet and complete resignation of the self to such forms of the Divine Power denotes a higher stage of spiritual development. <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">3</font></a> Such dualistic worship also speedily bears the fruit of knowledge of the Universal Unity, the realization of which dispels all fear. For the Mother is only terrible to those who, living in the illusion of separateness (which is the cause of all fear), have not yet realized their unity with Her, and known that all Her forms are those of beauty.</p>  
 <p>The Devī as Parabrahman is beyond all form and <i>guṇa</i>. The forms of the Mother of the universe are threefold. There is first the Supreme (<i>para</i>) form, of</p>

 <p>which, as the Viṣṇu Yāmala <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">1</font></a> says, "none know." There is next Her subtle (<i>sūkṣma</i>) form, which consists of <i>mantra</i>. But, as the mind cannot easily settle itself upon that which is formless, <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">2</font></a> She appears as the subject of contemplation in Her third or gross (<i>sthūla</i>) or physical form, with hands and feet and the like, as celebrated in the <i>Devīstotra</i> of the Purāṇas and Tantras. Devī, who as <i>Prakṛti</i> is the source of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara, <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">3</font></a> has both male and female forms. <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">4</font></a> But it is in Her female forms that she is chiefly contemplated. For, though existing in all things, in a peculiar sense female beings are parts of Her. <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">5</font></a> The Great Mother, who exists in the form of all Tantras and all Yantras, <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">6</font></a> is, as the Lalitā says, the "unsullied treasure-house of beauty," the sapphire Devī <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">7</font></a> whose slender</p>

Her litanies depict Her physical form from head to foot, celebrating Her hair adorned with flowers and crowned with gems; Her brow bright as the eighth-day moon; Her ruby cheeks and coral lips; teeth like to "the buds of the sixteen-syllabled <i>mantra</i>," and eyebrows curved as are the arches at the gate of the palace of Kāmarāja; Her nose; Her teeth; Her chin; Her arms; and "Her twin breasts offered in return for that priceless gem which is the love of Kāmeśvara"; Her waist girdled with jewelled bells; Her smooth and faultless limbs rounded beneath the "jewelled disc of the knee like the</p>

 <p>sapphire-studded quiver of the God of Love" descending in lines of grace to Her bright louts feet, <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a> which dispel the darkness of Her worshippers. <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">2</font></a> For moonlight is She, yet sunbeam, soothing all those who are burnt by the triple fires of misery (<i>tāpatraya</i>). Her face, Her body from throat to waist, and thence downwards, represent the <i>vāgbhava</i> and other <i>kūta</i>. The colour of the Devī varies according to the form under which She is contemplated. Thus, in conferring liberation, She is white; as controller of women, men, and kings, She is red; and as controller of wealth, saffron. As creatrix of enmity, She becomes tawny; and in the thrill of love, passion (<i>śṛngāra</i>), She is of the colour of the rose. In the action of slaying She becomes black. Thus, Devī, the Supreme Light, is to be meditated upon as differently coloured according to Her different activities. <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>  
 <p>After the description of the form of the Devī in <i>brahmāṇḍa</i> follows that of Her subtle form, called Kuṇḍalinī in the body (<i>piṇḍāṇḍa</i>). As the Mahādevī <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">4</font></a> She exists in all forms as Śarasvatī, Lakṣmī, Gāyatrī,</p>

 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Durgā, Tripurasundarī, Annapurṇā, and all the Devī who are <i>avatāra</i> of the Brahman. <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>Devī, as Satī, Umā, Pārvatī, and Gourī, is spouse of Śiva. It was as Satī, prior to Dakṣa's sacrifice (<i>dakṣayajna</i>) that the Devī manifested Herself to Śiva <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">2</font></a> in the ten celebrated forms known as the <i>daśamahāvidyā</i>--Kālī, Bagala, Chinnamastā, Bhuvaneshvarī, Mātanginī, Shorosi, Dhumāvati, Tripurasundarī, Tārā, and Bhairavī. When at the <i>dakṣayajna</i> She yielded up Her life in shame and sorrow at the treatment accorded by Her father to Her husband, Śiva took away the body, and, ever bearing it with him, remained wholly distraught and spent with grief. To save the world from the forces of evil which arose and grew with the withdrawal of His divine control, Viṣṇu, with his discus (<i>cakra</i>), cut the dead body of Satī, which Śiva bore, into fifty-one fragments, which fell to earth at the places thereafter known as the fifty-one <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">3</font></a> <i>mahāpīthasthānas</i>, where Devī, with her Bhairava, is worshipped under various names.</p>  
 <p>Thus the right and left breasts fell at Jalandhara and Ramgiri, where the Devī is worshipped as Tripuramālinī; the <i>yoni</i> at the celebrated shrine at Kamrup in Assam, where the Devī is worshipped as Kāmākṣā or Kāmākhyā (see <i>ibid</i>.); <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">4</font></a> the throat, shoulders, nose, hands,</p>

 <p>arms, eyes, fingers, tongue, buttocks, lips, belly, chin, navel, cheeks, thighs, teeth, feet, ears, thumbs, heels, toes (some at Kālīghat), waist, hair, forehead, with skeleton (several of these parts being themselves divided), fell at other <i>pītha</i>, at each of which the Devī is worshipped under different names in company with a Bhairava or Śiva, also variously named. Thus, the Devī at Kālīghat is Kālikā, and the Śiva Nakuleśvara, and the Devī at Kamrup is Kāmākshā, and Her Bhairava is Ramānanda.</p>  
 <p>These are but some only of Her endless forms. She is seen as one and as many: as it were, but one moon reflected in countless waters. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a> She exists, too, in all animals and inorganic things, since the universe, with all its beauties, is, as the Devī Purāṇa says, but a part of Her. All this diversity of form is but the infinite manifestations of the flowering beauty of the one Supreme Life--a doctrine which is nowhere else taught with greater wealth of illustration than in the Śākta Śāstras and Tantras. The great Bharga in the bright sun, and all Devatā, and, indeed, all life and being are worshipful, and are worshipped, but only as Her manifestations. <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">2</font></a> And he who worships them otherwise is, in the words of the great Devībhāgavata, <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">3</font></a> "like unto a man who, with the light of a clear lamp</p>

 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>in his hands, yet falls into some waterless and terrible well." It is customary nowadays to decry external worship, but those who do so presume too much. The ladder of ascent can only be scaled by those who have trod all, including its lowest, rungs. The Śaktirahasya summarises the stages of progress in a short verse, thus: "A mortal who worships by ceremonies, by images, by mind, by identification, by knowing the self, attains <i>kaivalya</i>." Before <i>brahma-bhāva</i> can be attained the <i>sādhaka</i> must have passed from <i>pūjābhāva</i> through hymns and prayer to <i>dhyāna-bhāva</i>. The highest worship <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">1</font></a> for which the <i>sādhaka</i> is qualified (<i>adhikāri</i>) only after external worship, and that internal form known as <i>sādhāra</i> <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">2</font></a> is described as <i>nirādhāra</i>. Therein Pure Intelligence is the Supreme Śakti who is worshipped as the Very Self, the Witness freed of the glamour of the manifold universe. By one's own direct experience of Maheśvarī as the Self, She is, with reverence, made the object of that worship which leads to liberation.</p>

 <p>"Though the Mother beat him, the child cries 'Mother! O Mother!' and clings still tighter to her garment. True, I cannot see Thee, yet am I not a lost child. I still cry 'Mother!'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_26"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_26">6:3</a> <i>Ibid</i>., and as such is called Tripurā (see Bhāskararāyā's Commentary on Lalitā, verse 125).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_27"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_27">6:4</a> <i>Ibid</i>., chap. iii., which also says that there is no eunuch form of God.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_28"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_28">6:5</a> So in Candi (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa) it is said:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>"<i>Vidyāh samastāstava devī bhedāh,<br> Stryah samastāsakalā jagatsu</i>."</dir>  
 <p>The Tāntrika, more than all men, recognizes the divinity of woman, as was observed centuries past by the author of the Dabistan. The Linga Purāṇa also, after describing Arundhati, Anasūyā and Shachi to be each the manifestation of Devī, concludes: "All things indicated by words in the feminine gender are manifestations of Devī." <a href="errata.htm#1">Similarly</a> the Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_29"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_29">6:6</a> <i>Sarvatantrarūpā Sarvayantrātmīkā</i> (See Lalitā, verse 53).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_30"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_30">6:7</a> Padma Purāṇa says: "Viṣṇu ever worships the sapphire Devī."</p>

 <p><a name="fn_32"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_32">7:2</a> <i>Stotra</i> and <i>dhyāna</i> commonly represent Her as having large, full, and erect breasts--<i>pīnastanādye</i> (in Karpurādistotra), <i>pinonnatapayodharām</i>) (in Durgā-dhyāna of Devī Purāṇa), <i>bakshojakumbhāntari</i> (in Annapurṇāstava) <i>āpivarastanatatim</i> (in Bhuvaneśvarīstotra)--which weight her limbs--<i>kuchabharanamitāngīm</i> (in Sarasvatidhyāna), <i>annapradānaniratāngstanabhāranamrām</i> (in Annapūrṇastava). And the Lalitā, verse 15, says: "Her golden girdle supports Her waist, which bends under the burden of Her breasts, thrice folding the skin below Her bosom" (<i>trivalīvalayopetām</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_33"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_33">7:3</a> So it is said in the tenth <i>śloka</i> of the Karpūrākhyastava <i>samantādāpīnastanajaghanadhrikyauvanavatī</i>. Śankarācarya, in his Tripurāsundarīstotra, speaks of Her <i>nitaniba</i> (buttocks) "as excelling the mountain in greatness" (<i>nitambajitabhūdharām</i>). The Javanese also call Her Loro Jongram, "The pure exalted virgin with beautiful hips."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_34"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_34">7:4</a> The physical characteristics of the Devī in Her swelling breasts and hips are emblematic of Her great Motherhood, for She is <i>Śrimātā</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_35"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_35">8:1</a> See the Lalitāsahasranāma, verse 4 <i>et seq</i>.

 <p><a name="fn_41"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_41">9:3</a> The number is variously given as 50, 51, and 52.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_42"></a><a href="htg03.htm#fr_42">9:4</a> Here at Her shrine the menstruation of the earth which, according to Hindu belief, takes place in the month of Assar, is <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a> said to manifest itself.
