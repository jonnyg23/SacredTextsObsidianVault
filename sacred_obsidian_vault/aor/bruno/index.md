 Giordano Bruno, 1548-1600, was persecuted by the Church
 for his heretical views, most notably his belief
 that there are countless inhabited worlds around distant stars. 
 Bruno also advocated the Copernican system.
 Unlike Galileo, who grudgingly recanted his views, Bruno ended up
 being burned at the stake.</p>
