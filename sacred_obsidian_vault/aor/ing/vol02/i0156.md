 <h3 align="CENTER">THE JUDGEMENT-DAY.</h3>
 <p>And what is the next thing?</p>
 <p>"We believe in a final judgement, the issues of which are everlasting punishment and everlasting life."</p>
 <p>At the final judgment all of us will be there. The thousands, and millions, and billions, and trillions, and quadrillions that have died will he there. The books will be opened, and each case will be called. The sheep and the goats will be divided. The unbelievers will be sent to the left, while the faithful will proudly walk to the right. The saved, without a tear, will bid an eternal farewell to those who loved them here--to those they loved. Nearly all the human race will go away to everlasting punishment, and the fortunate few to eternal life. This is the consolation of the Congregational Church! This is the hope that dispels the gloom of life!</p>
