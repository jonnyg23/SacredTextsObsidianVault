 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the nature of light (130. 131).</font></span>The reason by which we know that a light radiates from a single
 centre is this: We plainly see that a large light is often much
 broader than some small object which nevertheless--and although the
 rays [of the large light] are much more than twice the extent [of
 the small body]--always has its shadow cast on the nearest surface
 very visibly. Let <i>c f</i> be a broad light and <i>n</i> be the object in
 front of it, casting a shadow on the plane, and let <i>a b</i> be the
 plane. It is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the
 shadow <i>n</i> on the plane, but that the light has within it a centre
 is shown by this experiment. The shadow falls on the plane as is
 shown at <i>m o t r</i>.

  Why, to two [eyes] or in front of
 two eyes do 3 objects appear as two?

 Why, when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights
 the nearer
 </p><p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78</font></a></p>
 <p>appears confused. I say that the eye projects an infinite
 number of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to
 it from the object looked at. And it is only the central and
 sensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects;
 all the others are false and illusory. And if you place 2 objects at
 half an arm's length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the
 eye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second;
 the reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of
 false lines than the second and so is rendered vague.

 Light acts in the same manner, for in the effects of its lines
 (=rays), and particularly in perspective, it much resembles the eye;
 and its central rays are what cast the true shadow. When the object
 in front of it is too quickly overcome with dim rays it will cast a
 broad and disproportionate shadow, ill defined; but when the object
 which is to cast the shadow and cuts off the rays near to the place
 where the shadow falls, then the shadow is distinct; and the more so
 in proportion as the light is far off, because at a long distance
 the central ray is less overcome by false rays; because the lines
 from the eye and the solar and other luminous rays passing through
 the atmosphere are obliged to travel in straight lines. Unless they
 are deflected by a denser or rarer air, when they will be bent at
 some point, but so long as the air is free from grossness or
 moisture they will preserve their direct course, always carrying the
 image of the object that intercepts them back to their point of
 origin. And if this is the eye, the intercepting object will be seen
 by its colour, as well as by form and size. But if the intercepting
 plane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker
 chamber--not darker in colour, but by absence of light--you will see
 the rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane
 beyond all the details of the

 object they proceed from both as to
 colour and form; only every thing will be upside down. But the size
 [of the image] where the lines are reconstructed will be in
 proportion to the relative distance of the aperture from the plane
 on which the lines fall [on one hand] and from their origin [on the
 other]. There they intersect and form 2 pyramids with their point
 meeting [a common apex] and their bases opposite. Let <i>a b</i> be the
 point of origin of the lines, <i>d e</i> the first plane, and <i>c</i> the
 aperture with the intersection of the lines; <i>f g</i> is the inner
 plane. You will find that <i>a</i> falls upon the inner plane below at
 <i>g</i>, and <i>b</i> which is below will go up to the spot <i>f</i>; it will be
 quite evident to experimenters that every luminous body has in
 itself a core or centre, from which and to which all the lines
 radiate which are sent forth by the surface of the luminous body and
 reflected back to it; or which, having been thrown out and not
 intercepted, are dispersed in the air.
