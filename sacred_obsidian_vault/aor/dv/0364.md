 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS OF BOYS AND MEN.</h3>
 <p>
 There is a great difference in the length between the joints in men
 and boys for, in man, from the top of the shoulder [by the neck] to
 the elbow, and from the elbow to the tip of the thumb and from one
 shoulder to the other, is in each instance two heads, while in a boy
 it is but one because Nature constructs in us the mass which is the
 home of the intellect, before forming that which contains the vital
 elements.
