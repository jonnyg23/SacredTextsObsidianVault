 <p><a name="fn_235"></a><a href="0487.htm#fr_235">244:233</a>  486, 487: These are the only two passages in which
 Leonardo alludes to the importance of antique art in the training of
 an artist. The question asked in No. 486 remains unanswered by him
 and it seems to me very doubtful whether the opinion stated in No.
 487 is to be regarded as a reply to it. This opinion stands in the
 MS. in a connection--as will be explained later on--which seems to
 require us to limit its application to a single special case. At any
 rate we may suspect that when Leonardo put the question, he felt
 some hesitation as to the answer. Among his very numerous drawings I
 have not been able to find a single study from the antique, though a
 drawing in black chalk, at Windsor, of a man on horseback (<a href="dv10783.htm#img_pl073">Pl. LXXIII</a>)
 may perhaps be a reminiscence of the statue of Marcus
 Aurelius at Rome. It seems to me that the drapery in a pen and ink
 drawing of a bust, also at Windsor, has been borrowed from an
 antique model (<a href="pl030.htm#img_pl030">Pl. XXX</a>). G. G. Rossi has, I believe, correctly
 interpreted Leonardo's feeling towards the antique in the following
 note on this passage in manzi's edition, p. 501: "Sappiamo dalla
 storia, che i valorosi artisti Toscani dell'età dell'oro dell'arte
 studiarono sugli antichi marmi raccolti dal Magnifico LORENZO DE'
 MEDICI. Pare che il Vinci a tali monumenti non si accostasse. Quest'
 uomo sempre riconosce per maestra la natura, e questo principio lo
 stringeva alla sola imitazione dì essa"--Compare No. 10, 26--28
