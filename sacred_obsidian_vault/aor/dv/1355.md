 <p>O blessed and happy spirit whence comest thou? Well have I known
 this man, much against my will. This one is a receptacle of
 villainy; he is a perfect heap of the utmost ingratitude combined
 with every vice. But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain
 words? Nothing is to be found in them but every form of sin ... And
 if there should be found among them any that possesses any good,
 they will not be treated differently to myself by other men; and in
 fine, I come to the conclusion that it is bad if they are hostile,
 and worse if they are friendly.

 <p><a name="fn_382"></a><a href="1355.htm#fr_382">411:688</a> : This passage, very difficult to decipher, is on the
 reverse of a drawing at Windsor, <a href="pl122.htm#img_pl122">Pl. CXXII</a>, which possibly has some
 connection with it. The drawing is slightly reduced in this
 reproduction; the original being 25 cm. high by 19 cm. wide.</p>
