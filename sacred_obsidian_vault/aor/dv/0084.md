 Pictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,
 look of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the
 apex of the pyramid <i>f c d</i> is as far from the object <i>c</i> <i>d</i> as the
 same point <i>f</i> is

 <p>from the object <i>a</i> <i>b</i>; and yet <i>c</i> <i>d</i>, which is
 the base made by the painter's point, is smaller than <i>a</i> <i>b</i> which
 is the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and
 refracted at <i>s</i> <i>t</i>, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by
 experiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the
 painter's plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and
 the same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.
