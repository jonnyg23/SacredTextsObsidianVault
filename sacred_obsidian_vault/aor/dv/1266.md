 The thrushes rejoiced greatly at seeing a man take the owl and
 deprive her of liberty, tying her feet with strong bonds. But this
 owl was afterwards by means of bird-lime the cause of the thrushes
 losing not only their liberty, but their life. This is said for
 those countries which rejoice in seeing their governors lose their
 liberty, when by that means they themselves lose all succour, and
 remain in bondage in the power of their enemies, losing their
 liberty and often their life.
