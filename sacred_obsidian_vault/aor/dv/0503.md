 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> How to acquire universality (503-506).</font></span>The painter should aim at universality, because there is a great
 want of self-respect in doing one thing well and another badly, as
 many do who study only the [rules of] measure and proportion in the
 nude figure and do not seek after variety; for a man may be well
 proportioned, or he may be fat and short, or tall and thin, or
 medium. And a painter who takes no account of these varieties always
 makes his figures on one pattern so that they might all be taken for
 brothers; and this is a defect that demands stern reprehension.
