 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE LIGHTS ON DARK LEAVES.</h3>
 <p>
 The lights on such leaves which are darkest, will be most near to
 the colour of the atmosphere that is reflected in them. And the
 cause of this is that the light on the illuminated portion mingles
 with the dark hue to compose a blue colour; and this light is
 produced by the blueness of the atmosphere which is reflected in the
 smooth surface of these leaves and adds to the blue hue which this
 light usually produces when it falls on dark objects.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE LIGHTS ON LEAVES OF A YELLOWISH GREEN.</h3>
 <p>
 But leaves of a green verging on yellow when they reflect the
 atmosphere do not produce a reflection verging on blue, inasmuch as
 every thing which appears in a mirror takes some colour from that
 mirror, hence the blue of the atmosphere being reflected in the
 yellow of the leaf appears green, because blue and yellow mixed
 together make a very fine green colour, therefore the lustre of
 light leaves verging on yellow will be greenish yellow.
