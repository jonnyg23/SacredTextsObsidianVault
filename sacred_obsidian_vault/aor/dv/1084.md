 <p>
 The reason is that if you put together the mouths of the rivers
 which discharge into the Mediterranean sea, you would find the sum
 of water to be larger than that which this sea pours through the
 straits into the ocean. You see Africa discharging its rivers that
 run northwards into this sea, and among them the Nile which runs
 through 3000 miles of Africa; there is also the Bagrada river and
 the Schelif and others.  <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_267"><font size="1">601</font></a>
 
 Likewise Europe pours into it the Don and the Danube, the Po, the
 Rhone, the Arno, and the Tiber, so that evidently these rivers, with
 an infinite number of others of less fame, make its great breadth
 and depth and current; and the sea is not wider than 18 miles at the
 most westerly point of land where it divides Europe from Africa.
