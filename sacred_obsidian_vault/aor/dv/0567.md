 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY FACES [SEEN] AT A DISTANCE LOOK DARK.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The methods of aerial (567--570).</font></span>We see quite plainly that all the images of visible objects that lie
 before us, whether large or small, reach our sense by the minute
 aperture of the eye; and if, through so small a passage the image
 can pass of the vast extent of sky and earth, the face of a
 man--being by comparison with such large images almost nothing by
 reason of the distance which diminishes it,--fills up so little of
 the eye that it is indistinguishable. Having, also, to be
 transmitted from the surface to the sense through a dark medium,
 that is to say the crystalline lens which looks dark, this image,
 not being strong in colour becomes affected by this darkness on its
 passage, and on reaching the sense it appears dark; no other reason
 can in any way be assigned. If the point in the eye is black, it is
 because it is full of a transparent humour as clear as air and acts
 like a perforation in a board; on looking into it it appears dark
 and the objects seen through the bright air and a dark one become
 confused in this darkness.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY A MAN SEEN AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE IS NOT RECOGNISABLE.</h3>
 <p>
 The perspective of diminution shows us that the farther away an
 object is the smaller it looks. If you look at a man at a distance
 </p><p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a></p>
 <p>from you of an arrow's flight, and hold the eye of a small needle
 close to your own eye, you can see through it several men whose
 images are transmitted to the eye and will all be comprised within
 the size of the needle's eye; hence, if the man who is at the
 distance of an arrow's flight can send his whole image to your eye,
 occupying only a small space in the needle's eye how can you
 [expect] in so small a figure to distinguish or see the nose or
 mouth or any detail of his person? and, not seeing these you cannot
 recognise the man, since these features, which he does not show, are
 what give men different aspects.
