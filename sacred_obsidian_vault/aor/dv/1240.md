 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE DRAGON.</h3>
 <p>
 This creature entangles itself in the legs of the elephant which
 falls upon it, and so both die, and in its death it is avenged.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE VIPER.</h3>
 <p>
 She, in pairing opens her mouth and at last clenches her teeth and
 kills her husband. Then the young ones, growing within her body rend
 her open and kill their mother.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE SCORPION.</h3>
 <p>
 Saliva, spit out when fasting will kill a scorpion. This may be
 likened to abstinence from greediness, which removes and heals the
 ills which result from that gluttony, and opens the path of virtue.
