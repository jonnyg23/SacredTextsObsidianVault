 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the spots in the moon (903-907).</font></span>Some have said that vapours rise from the moon, after the manner of
 clouds and are interposed between the moon and our eyes. But, if
 this were the case, these spots would never be permanent, either as
 to position or form; and, seeing the moon from various aspects, even
 if these spots did not move they would change in form, as objects do
 which are seen from different sides.
