 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF A MODE OF DRAWING A PLACE ACCURATELY.</h3>
 <p>
 Have a piece of glass as large as a half sheet of royal folio paper
 and set thus firmly in front of your eyes that is, between your eye
 and the thing you want to draw; then place yourself at a distance of
 2/3 of a braccia from the glass fixing your head with a machine in
 such a way that you cannot move it at all. Then shut or entirely
 cover one eye and with a brush or red chalk draw upon the glass that
 which you see beyond it; then trace it on paper from the glass,
 afterwards transfer it onto good paper, and paint it if you like,
 carefully attending to the arial perspective.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW TO LEARN TO PLACE YOUR FIGURES CORRECTLY.</h3>
 <p>
 If you want to acquire a practice of good and correct attitudes for
 your figures, make a square frame or net, and square it out
 </p><p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a></p>
 <p>with thread; place this between your eye and the nude model you are
 drawing, and draw these same squares on the paper on which you mean
 to draw the figure, but very delicately. Then place a pellet of wax
 on a spot of the net which will serve as a fixed point, which,
 whenever you look at your model, must cover the pit of the throat;
 or, if his back is turned, it may cover one of the vertebrae of the
 neck. Thus these threads will guide you as to each part of the body
 which, in any given attitude will be found below the pit of the
 throat, or the angles of the shoulders, or the nipples, or hips and
 other parts of the body; and the transverse lines of the net will
 show you how much the figure is higher over the leg on which it is
 posed than over the other, and the same with the hips, and the knees
 and the feet. But always fix the net perpendicularly so that all the
 divisions that you see the model divided into by the net work
 correspond with your drawing of the model on the net work you have
 sketched. The squares you draw may be as much smaller than those of
 the net as you wish that your figure should be smaller than nature.
 Afterwards remember when drawing figures, to use the rule of the
 corresponding proportions of the limbs as you have learnt it from
 the frame and net. This should be 3 braccia and a half high and 3
 braccia wide; 7 braccia distant from you and 1 braccio from the
 model.

 <p><a name="fn_250"></a><a href="0523.htm#fr_250">261:248</a> : Leonardo is commonly credited with the invention of the
 arrangement of a plate of glass commonly known as the "vertical
 plane." Professor E. VON BRUCKE in his <i>"Bruchstucke aus der Theorie
 der bildenden Kunste,"</i> Leipzig 1877, pg. 3, writes on this
 contrivance. <i>"Unsere Glastafel ist die sogenannte Glastafel des
 Leonardo da Vinci, die in Gestalt einer Glastafel vorgestellte
 Bildflache."</i></p>
