 <i>Such theoretical questions, as have been laid before the reader in
 Sections XVI and XVII, though they were the chief subjects of
 Leonardo's studies of the sea, did not exclusively claim his
 attention. A few passages have been collected at the beginning of
 this section, which prove that he had turned his mind to the
 practical problems of navigation, and more especially of naval
 warfare. What we know for certain of his life gives us no data, it
 is true, as to when or where these matters came under his
 consideration; but the fact remains certain both from these notes in
 his manuscripts, and from the well known letter to Ludovico il Moro
 (No.</i> 1340<i>), in which he expressly states that he is as capable as
 any man, in this very department.</i>
 <p>
 <i>The numerous notes as to the laws and rationale of the flight of
 birds, are scattered through several note-books. An account of these
 is given in the Bibliography of the manuscripts at the end of this
 work. It seems probable that the idea which led him to these
 investigations was his desire to construct a flying or aerial
 machine for man. At the same time it must be admitted that the notes
 on the two subjects are quite unconnected in the manuscripts, and
 that those on the flight of birds are by far the most numerous and
 extensive. The two most important passages that treat of the
 construction of a flying machine are those already published as Tav.
 XVI, No.</i> 1 <i>and Tav. XVIII in the</i> "Saggio delle opere di Leonardo
 da Vinci" <i>(Milan</i> 1872<i>). The passages--Nos.</i> 1120-1125--<i>here
 printed for the first time and hitherto unknown--refer to the same
 subject and, with the exception of one already published in the
 Saggio-- No.</i> 1126--<i>they are, so far as I know, the only notes,
 among the numerous observations on the flight of birds, in which the
 phenomena are incidentally and expressly connected with the idea of
 a flying machine.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The notes on machines of war, the construction of fortifications,
 and similar matters which fall within the department of the
 Engineer, have not been included in this work, for the reasons given
 on page</i> 26 <i>of this Vol. An exception has been made in favour of
 the passages Nos.</i> 1127 <i>and</i> 1128, <i>because they have a more
 general interest, as bearing on</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a></p>
 <p><i>the important question: whence the
 Master derived his knowledge of these matters. Though it would be
 rash to assert that Leonardo was the first to introduce the science
 of mining into Italy, it may be confidently said that he is one of
 the earliest writers who can be proved to have known and understood
 it; while, on the other hand, it is almost beyond doubt that in the
 East at that time, the whole science of besieging towns and mining
 in particular, was far more advanced than in Europe. This gives a
 peculiar value to the expressions used in No.</i> 1127.
 </p><p>
 <i>I have been unable to find in the manuscripts any passage whatever
 which throws any light on Leonardo's great reputation as a musician.
 Nothing therein illustrates VASARPS well-known statement:</i> Avvenne
 che morto Giovan Galeazze duca di Milano, e creato Lodovico Sforza
 nel grado medesimo anno 1494, fu condotto a Milano con gran
 riputazione Lionardo al duca, il quale molto si dilettava del suono
 della lira, perche sonasse; e Lionardo porto quello strumento
 ch'egli aveva di sua mano fabbricato d'argento gran parte, in forma
 d'un teschio di cavallo, cosa bizzarra e nuova, acciocche l'armonia
 fosse con maggior tuba e piu sonora di voce; laonde supero tutti i
 musici che quivi erano concorsi a sonare.
 </p><p>
 <i>The only notes on musical matters are those given as Nos.</i> 1129
 <i>and</i> 1130, <i>which explain certain arrangements in instruments.</i>
