 <h3 align="CENTER">ON THE NATURE OF THE ARCH.</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">WHAT IS AN ARCH?</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v208600"></a>

 <p>
 The arch is nothing else than a force originated by two weaknesses,
 for the arch in buildings is composed of two segments of a circle,
 each of which being very weak in itself tends to fall; but as each
 opposes this tendency in the other, the two weaknesses combine to
 form one strength.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE KIND OF PRESSURE IN ARCHES.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v208601"></a>
 <img src="img/v208601.jpg"></p>
 <p>
 As the arch is a composite force it remains in equilibrium because
 the thrust is equal from both sides; and if one of the segments
 weighs more than the other the stability is lost, because the
 greater pressure will outweigh the lesser.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF DISTRIBUTING THE PRESSURE ABOVE AN ARCH.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v208602"></a>

 <p>
 Next to giving the segments of the circle equal weight it is
 necessary to load them equally, or you will fall into the same
 defect as before.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHERE AN ARCH BREAKS.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v208700"></a>
 <img src="img/v208700.jpg"></p>
 <p>
 An arch breaks at the part which lies below half way from the
 centre.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">SECOND RUPTURE OF THE ARCH.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v208701"></a>

 <p>
 If the excess of weight be placed in the middle of the arch at the
 point <i>a</i>, that weight tends to fall towards <i>b</i>, and the arch
 breaks at 2/3 of its height at <i>c e</i>; and <i>g e</i> is as many times
 stronger than <i>e a</i>, as <i>m o</i> goes into <i>m n</i>.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ON ANOTHER CAUSE OF RUIN.</h3>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v208702"></a>

 <p>
 The arch will likewise give way under a transversal thrust, for when
 the charge is not thrown directly on the foot of the arch, the arch
 lasts but a short time.
