 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THAT A PAINTER OUGHT TO BE CURIOUS TO HEAR THE OPINIONS OF EVERY ONE ON HIS WORK.</h3>
 <p>
 Certainly while a man is painting he ought not to shrink from
 hearing every opinion. For we know very well that a man, though he
 may not be a painter, is familiar with the forms of other men and
 very capable of judging whether they are hump backed, or have one
 shoulder higher or lower than the other, or too big a mouth or nose,
 and other defects; and, as we know that men are competent to judge
 of the works of nature, how much more ought we to admit that they
 can judge of our errors; since you know how much a man may be
 deceived in his own work. And if you are not conscious of this in
 yourself study it in others and profit by their faults. Therefore be
 curious to hear with patience the opinions of others, consider and
 weigh well whether those who find fault have ground or not for
 blame, and, if so amend; but, if not make as though you had not
 heard, or if he should be a man you esteem show him by argument the
 cause of his mistake.
