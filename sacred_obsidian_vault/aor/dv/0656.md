 We know very well that a really experienced and good painter will
 not make such mistakes; on the contrary, with sound rules he will
 remove so little at a time that he will bring his work to a good
 issue. Again the sculptor if working in clay or wax, can add or
 reduce, and when his model is finished it can easily be cast in
 bronze, and this is the last operation and is the most permanent
 form of sculpture. Inasmuch as that which is merely of marble is
 liable to ruin, but not bronze. Hence a painting done on copper
 which as I said of painting may be added to or altered, resembles
 sculpture in bronze, which, having first been made in wax could then
 be altered or added to; and if sculpture in bronze is durable, this
 work in copper and enamel is absolutely imperishable. Bronze is but
 dark and rough after all, but this latter is covered with various
 and lovely colours in infinite variety, as has been said above; or
 if you will have me only speak of painting on panel, I am content to
 pronounce between it and sculpture; saying that painting is the more
 beautiful and the more imaginative and the more copious, while
 sculpture is the more durable but it has nothing else. Sculpture
 shows with little labour what in painting appears a miraculous thing
 to do; to make what is impalpable appear palpable, flat objects
 appear in relief, distant objects seem close. In fact painting is
 adorned with infinite possibilities which sculpture cannot command.
