 <p>
 trochilus, a very small bird, runs at once to its mouth and hops
 among its teeth and goes pecking out the remains of the food, and so
 inciting it with voluptuous delight tempts it to open the whole of
 its mouth, and so it sleeps. This being observed by the ichneumon it
 flings itself into its mouth and perforates its stomach and bowels,
 and finally kills it.

 <p>
 Nature has given such knowledge to animals, that besides the
 consciousness of their own advantages they know the disadvantages of
 their foes. Thus the dolphin understands what strength lies in a cut
 from the fins placed on his chine, and how tender is the belly of
 the crocodile; hence in fighting with him it thrusts at him from
 beneath and rips up his belly and so kills him.
 </p><p>
 The crocodile is a terror to those that flee, and a base coward to
 those that pursue him.
