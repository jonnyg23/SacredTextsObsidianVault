 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The appearance of trees in the distance (450. 451).</font></span>The spaces between the parts in the mass of trees, and the spaces
 between the trees in the air, are, at great distances, invisible to
 the eye; for, where it is an effort [even] to see the whole it is
 most difficult to discern the parts.--But a confused mixture is the
 result, partaking chiefly of the [hue] which predominates. The
 spaces between the leaves consist of particles of illuminated air
 which are very much smaller than the tree and are lost sight of
 sooner than the tree; but it does not therefore follow that they are
 not there. Hence, necessarily, a compounded [effect] is produced of
 the sky and of the shadows of the tree in shade, which both together
 strike the eye which sees them.

 That part of a tree will show the fewest spaces, behind which a
 large number of trees are standing between the tree and the air
 [sky]; thus in the tree <i>a</i> the spaces are not concealed nor in <i>b</i>,
 as there is no tree behind. But in <i>c</i> only half shows the spaces
 filled up by the tree <i>d</i>, and part of the tree <i>d</i> is filled up by
 the tree <i>e</i> and a little farther on all the spaces in the mass of
 the trees are lost, and only that at the side remains.
