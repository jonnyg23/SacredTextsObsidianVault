 </p><h3 align="CENTER">A WAY OF DEVELOPING AND AROUSING THE MIND TO VARIOUS INVENTIONS.</h3>
 <p>
 I cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for
 study which, although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous,
 is nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various
 inventions. And this is, when you look at a wall spotted with
 stains, or with a mixture of stones, if you have to devise some
 scene, you may discover a resemblance to various landscapes,
 beautified with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide
 valleys and hills in varied arrangement; or again you may see
 battles and figures in action; or strange faces and costumes, and an
 endless variety of objects, which you could reduce to complete and
 well drawn forms. And these appear on such walls confusedly, like
 the sound of bells in whose jangle you may find any name or word you
 choose to imagine.
