 <p>
 Feathers will raise men, as they do birds, towards heaven (that is,
 by the letters which are written with quills.)
 </p><p>
 The works of men's hands will occasion their death. (Swords and
 Spears.)
 </p><p>
 Men out of fear will cling to the thing they most fear. (That is
 they will be miserable lest they should fall into misery.)
 </p><p>
 Things that are separate shall be united and acquire such virtue
 that they will restore to man his lost memory; that is papyrus
 [sheets] which are made of separate strips and have preserved the
 memory of the things and acts of men.
 </p><p>
 The bones of the Dead will be seen to govern the fortunes of him who
 moves them. (By Dice.)
 </p><p>
 Cattle with their horns protect the Flame from its death. (In a
 Lantern  <a name="fr_329"></a><a href="#fn_329"><font size="1">663</font></a>
 .)
 </p><p>
 The Forests will bring forth young which will be the cause of their
 death. (The handle of the hatchet.)
