 <p>
 Blood will be seen issuing from the torn flesh of men, and trickling
 down the surface.
 </p><p>
 Men will have such cruel maladies that they will tear their flesh
 with their own nails. (The Itch.)
 </p><p>
 Plants will be seen left without leaves, and the rivers standing
 still in their channels.
 </p><p>
 The waters of the sea will rise above the high peaks of the
 mountains towards heaven and fall again on to the dwellings of men.
 (That is, in Clouds.)
 </p><p>
 The largest trees of the forest will be seen carried by the fury of
 the winds from East to West. (That is across the Sea.)
 </p><p>
 Men will cast away their own victuals. (That is, in Sowing.)
