 Shadow is diminution of light.
 </p><p>
 Darkness is absence of light.
 </p><p>
 Shadow is divided into two kinds, of which the first is called
 primary shadow, the second is derived shadow. The primary shadow is
 always the basis of the derived shadow.
 </p><p>
 The edges of the derived shadow are straight lines.

 The darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is
 remote from the primary shadow.

 <p><a name="fn_71"></a><a href="0159.htm#fr_71">91:69</a> : The theory of the <i>ombra dirivativa</i>--a technical
 expression for which there is no precise English equivalent is
 elaborately treated by Leonardo. But both text and diagrams (as <a href="p1004.htm#img_pl004">Pl. IV</a>, 1-3 and <a href="pl005.htm#img_pl005">Pl. V</a>) must at once convince the student that the
 distinction he makes between <i>ombra primitiva</i> and <i>ombra
 dirivativa</i> is not merely justifiable but scientific. <i>Ombra
 dirivativa</i> is by no means a mere abstract idea. This is easily
 proved by repeating the experiment made by Leonardo, and by filling
 with smoke the room in which the existence of the <i>ombra dirivativa</i>
 is investigated, when the shadow becomes visible. Nor is it
 difficult to perceive how much of Leonardo's teaching depended on
 this theory. The recognised, but extremely complicated science of
 cast shadows--<i>percussione dell' ombre dirivative</i> as Leonardo
 calls them--is thus rendered more intelligible if not actually
 simpler, and we must assume this theory as our chief guide through
 the investigations which follow.</p>
