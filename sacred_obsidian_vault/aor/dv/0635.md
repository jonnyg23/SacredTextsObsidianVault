 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On varnishes [or powders] (635-637).</font></span>Take cypress [oil] and distil it and have a large pitcher, and put
 in the extract with so much water as may make it appear like amber,
 and cover it tightly so that none may evaporate. And when it is
 dissolved you may add in your pitcher as much of the said solution,
 as shall make it liquid to your taste. And you must know that amber
 is the gum of the cypress-tree.

 <p>
 And since varnish [powder] is the resin of juniper, if you distil
 juniper you can dissolve the said varnish [powder] in the essence,
 as explained above.
