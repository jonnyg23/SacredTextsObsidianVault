 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> General introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).</font></span>Seeing that I can find no subject specially useful or
 pleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their
 own every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being
 poor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing
 himself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,
 and not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,
 will load my humble pack with this despised and rejected
 merchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to
 distribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,
 taking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth.  <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">6</font></a>

 <p><a name="fn_8"></a><a href="0009.htm#fr_8">13:6</a> : It
 need hardly be pointed out that there is in this 'Proemio' a covert
 irony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his
 rivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against
 Neo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its
 futility is now no longer questioned.</p>
