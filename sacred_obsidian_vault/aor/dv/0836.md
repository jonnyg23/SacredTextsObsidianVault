 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The seat of the common sense.</font></span>The Common Sense, is that which judges of things offered to it by
 the other senses. The ancient speculators have concluded that that
 part of man which constitutes his judgment is caused by a central
 organ to which the other five senses refer everything by means of
 impressibility; and to this centre they have given the name Common
 Sense. And they say that this Sense is situated in the centre of the
 head between Sensation and Memory. And this name of Common Sense
 </p><p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a></p>
 <p>is given to it solely because it is the common judge of all the other
 five senses <i>i.e.</i> Seeing, Hearing, Touch, Taste and Smell. This
 Common Sense is acted upon by means of Sensation which is placed as
 a medium between it and the senses. Sensation is acted upon by means
 of the images of things presented to it by the external instruments,
 that is to say the senses which are the medium between external
 things and Sensation. In the same way the senses are acted upon by
 objects. Surrounding things transmit their images to the senses and
 the senses transfer them to the Sensation. Sensation sends them to
 the Common Sense, and by it they are stamped upon the memory and are
 there more or less retained according to the importance or force of
 the impression. That sense is most rapid in its function which is
 nearest to the sensitive medium and the eye, being the highest is
 the chief of the others. Of this then only we will speak, and the
 others we will leave in order not to make our matter too long.
 Experience tells us that the eye apprehends ten different natures of
 things, that is: Light and Darkness, one being the cause of the
 perception of the nine others, and the other its absence:-- Colour
 and substance, form and place, distance and nearness, motion and
 stillness  <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">433</font></a>
