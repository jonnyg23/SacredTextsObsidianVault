 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ARCH IN ARCHITECTURE.</h3>
 <p>
 The stability of the arch built by an architect resides in the tie
 and in the flanks.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ON THE POSITION OF THE TIE IN THE ABOVE NAMED ARCH.</h3>
 <p>
 The position of the tie is of the same importance at the beginning
 of the arch and at the top of the perpendicular pier on which it
 rests. This is proved by the 2nd "of supports" which says: that part
 of a support has least resistance which is farthest from its solid
 attachment; hence, as the top of the pier is farthest from the
 middle of its true foundation and the same being the case at the
 opposite extremities of the arch which are the points farthest from
 the middle, which is really its [upper] attachment, we have
 concluded that the tie <i>a b</i> requires to be in such a position as
 that its opposite ends are between the four above-mentioned
 extremes.
 </p><p>
 The adversary says that this arch must be more than half a circle,
 and that then it will not need a tie, because then the ends will not
 thrust outwards but inwards, as is seen in the excess at <i>a c</i>, <i>b
 d</i>. To this it must be answered that this would be a very poor
 device, for three reasons. The first refers to the strength of the
 arch, since it is proved that the circular parallel being composed
 of two semicircles will only break where these semicircles cross
 each other, as is seen in the figure <i>n m;</i> besides this it follows
 that there is a wider space between the extremes of the semicircle
 than between the plane of the walls; the third reason is that the
 weight placed to counterbalance the strength of the arch diminishes
 in proportion as the piers of the arch are wider than the space
 between the piers. Fourthly in proportion as the parts at <i>c a b d</i>
 turn outwards, the piers are weaker to support the arch above them.
 The 5th is that all the material and weight of the
 </p><p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a></p>
 <p>arch which are in
 excess of the semicircle are useless and indeed mischievous; and
 here it is to be noted that the weight placed above the arch will be
 more likely to break the arch at <i>a b</i>, where the curve of the
 excess begins that is added to the semicircle, than if the pier were
 straight up to its junction with the semicircle [spring of the
 arch].
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">AN ARCH LOADED OVER THE CROWN WILL GIVE WAY AT THE LEFT HAND AND RIGHT HAND QUARTERS.</h3>
 <p>
 This is proved by the 7th of this which says: The opposite ends of
 the support are equally pressed upon by the weight suspended to
 them; hence the weight shown at <i>f</i> is felt at <i>b c</i>, that is half
 at each extremity; and by the third which says: in a support of
 equal strength [throughout] that portion will give way soonest which
 is farthest from its attachment; whence it follows that <i>d</i> being
 equally distant from <i>f, e</i> .....

 <p>
 If the centering of the arch does not settle as the arch settles,
 the mortar, as it dries, will shrink and detach itself from the
 bricks between which it was laid to keep them together; and as it
 thus leaves them disjoined the vault will remain loosely built, and
 the rains will soon destroy it.
