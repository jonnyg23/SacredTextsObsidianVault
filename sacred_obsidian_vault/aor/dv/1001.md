 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Canals in connection with the Arno (1001-1008).</font></span>Sluices should be made in the valley of la Chiana at Arezzo, so that
 when, in the summer, the Arno lacks water, the canal may not remain
 dry: and let this canal be 20 braccia wide at the bottom, and at the
 top 30, and 2 braccia deep, or 4, so that two of these braccia may
 flow to the mills and the meadows, which will benefit the country;
 and Prato, Pistoia and Pisa, as well as Florence, will gain two
 hundred thousand ducats a year, and will lend a hand and money to
 this useful work; and the Lucchese the same, for the lake of Sesto
 will be navigable; I shall direct it to Prato and Pistoia, and cut
 through Serravalle and make an issue into the lake; for there will
 be no need of locks or supports, which are not lasting and so will
 always be giving trouble in working at them and keeping them up.
 </p><p>
 And know that in digging this canal where it is 4 braccia
 </p><p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>
 <p>deep, it will cost 4 dinari the square braccio; for twice the depth 6 dinari,
 if you are making 4 braccia  <a name="fr_199"></a><a href="#fn_199"><font size="1">533</font></a>
  and there are but 2 banks; that is to say one from the
 bottom of the trench to the surface of the edges of it, and the
 other from these edges to the top of the ridge of earth which will
 be raised on the margin of the bank. And if this bank were of double
 the depth only the first bank will be increased, that is 4 braccia
 increased by half the first cost; that is to say that if at first 4
 dinari were paid for 2 banks, for 3 it would come to 6, at 2 dinari
 the bank, if the trench measured 16 braccia at the bottom; again, if
 the trench were 16 braccia wide and 4 deep, coming to 4 lire for the
 work, 4 Milan dinari the square braccio; a trench which was 32
 braccia at the bottom would come to 8 dinari the square braccio.
