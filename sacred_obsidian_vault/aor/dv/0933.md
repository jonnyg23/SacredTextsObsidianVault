 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of the surface of the water in relation to the globe (933-936).</font></span>The centres of the sphere of water are two, one universal and common
 to all water, the other particular. The universal one is that which
 is common to all waters not in motion, which exist in great
 quantities. As canals, ditches, ponds, fountains, wells, dead
 rivers, lakes, stagnant pools and seas, which, although they are at
 various levels, have each in itself the limits of their superficies
 equally distant from the centre of the earth, such as lakes placed
 at the tops of high mountains; as the lake near Pietra Pana and the
 lake of the Sybil near Norcia; and all the lakes that give rise to
 great rivers, as the Ticino from Lago Maggiore, the Adda from the
 lake of Como, the Mincio from the lake of Garda, the Rhine from the
 lakes of Constance and of Chur, and from the lake of Lucerne, like
 the Tigris which passes through Asia Minor carrying with it the
 waters of three lakes, one above the other at different heights of
 which the highest is Munace, the middle one Pallas, and the lowest
 Triton; the Nile again flows from three very high lakes in Ethiopia.

 we may read Norchia, the remains of the Etruscan city near Viterbo,
 there can be no doubt that by '<i>Lago della Sibilla</i>'--a name not
 known elsewhere, so far as I can learn--Leonardo meant <i>Lago di
 Vico</i> (Lacus Ciminus, Aen. 7).</p>
