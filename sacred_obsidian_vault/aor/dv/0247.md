 When you are drawing any object, remember, in comparing the grades
 of light in the illuminated portions, that the eye is often deceived
 by seeing things lighter than they are. And the reason lies in our
 comparing those parts with the contiguous parts. Since if two
 [separate] parts are in different grades of light and if the less
 bright is conterminous with a dark portion and the brighter is
 conterminous with a light background--as the sky or something
 equally bright--, then that which is less light, or I should say
 less radiant, will look the brighter and the brighter will seem the
 darker.
