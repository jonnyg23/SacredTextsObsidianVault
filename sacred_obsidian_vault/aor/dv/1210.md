 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Against writers of epitomes.</font></span>Abbreviators do harm to knowledge and to love, seeing that the love
 of any thing is the offspring of this knowledge, the love being the
 more fervent in proportion as the knowledge is more certain. And
 this certainty is born of a complete knowledge of all the parts,
 which, when combined, compose the totality of the thing which ought
 to be loved. Of what use then is he who abridges the details of
 those matters of which he professes to give thorough information,
 while he leaves behind the chief part of the things of which the
 whole is composed? It is true that impatience, the mother of
 stupidity, praises brevity, as if such persons had not life long
 enough to serve them to acquire a complete knowledge of one single
 subject, such as the human body; and then they want to comprehend
 the mind of God in which the universe is included, weighing it
 minutely and mincing it into infinite parts, as if they had to
 dissect it!

 Oh! human stupidity, do you not perceive that, though you have been
 with yourself all your life, you are not yet aware of the thing you
 possess most of, that is of your folly? and then, with the crowd of
 sophists, you deceive yourselves and others, despising the
 mathematical sciences, in which truth dwells and the knowledge of
 the things included in them. And then you occupy yourself with
 miracles, and write that you possess information of those things of
 which the human mind is incapable and which cannot be proved by any
 instance from nature. And you fancy you have wrought miracles when
 you spoil a work of some

 you are falling into the same error as that of a man who strips a
 tree of the ornament of its branches covered with leaves mingled
 with the scented blossoms or fruit.......  <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">646</font></a>
  as Justinus did, in abridging the histories
 written by Trogus Pompeius, who had written in an ornate style all
 the worthy deeds of his forefathers, full of the most admirable and
 ornamental passages; and so composed a bald work worthy only of
 those impatient spirits, who fancy they are losing as much time as
 that which they employ usefully in studying the works of nature and
 the deeds of men. But these may remain in company of beasts; among
 their associates should be dogs and other animals full of rapine and
 they may hunt with them after...., and then follow helpless beasts,
 which in time of great snows come near to your houses asking alms as
 from their master....
