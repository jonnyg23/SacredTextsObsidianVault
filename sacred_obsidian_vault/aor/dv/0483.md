 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The course of instruction for an artist (483-485).</font></span>The youth should first learn perspective, then the proportions of
 objects. Then he may copy from some good master, to accustom himself
 to fine forms. Then from nature, to confirm by practice the rules he
 has learnt. Then see for a time the works of various masters. Then
 get the habit of putting his art into practice and work.

 <p><a name="fn_234"></a><a href="0483.htm#fr_234">243:232</a> : The Vatican copy and numerous abridgements all place this
 chapter at the beginning of the <i>Trattato</i>, and in consequence
 DUFRESNE and all subsequent editors have done the same. In the
 Vatican copy however all the general considerations on the relation
 of painting to the other arts are placed first, as introductory.</p>
