 <i>a b</i> goes 4 times into <i>a c</i> and 9 into <i>a m</i>. The greatest
 thickness of the arm between the elbow and the hand goes 6 times
 into <i>a m</i> and is equal to <i>r f</i>. The greatest thickness of the arm
 between the shoulder and the elbow goes 4 times into <i>c m</i>, and is
 equal to <i>h n g</i>. The smallest thickness of the arm above the elbow
 <i>x y</i> is not the base of a square, but is equal to half the space
 <i>h</i> 3 which is found between the inner joint of the arm and the
 wrist joint.
 </p><p>
 [11]The width of the wrist goes 12 times into the whole arm; that is
 from the tip of the fingers to the shoulder joint; that is 3 times
 into the hand and 9 into the arm.
 </p><p>
 The arm when bent is 4 heads.
 </p><p>
 The arm from the shoulder to the elbow in bending increases in
 length, that is in the length from the shoulder to the elbow, and
 this increase is equal to the thickness of the arm at the wrist when
 seen in profile. And the space between the bottom of the chin and
 the parting of the lips, is equal to the thickness of the 2 middle
 fingers, and to the width of the mouth and to the space between the
 roots of the hair on the forehead and the top of the head  <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">167</font></a>
 . All these distances
 are equal to each other, but they are not equal to the
 above-mentioned increase in the arm.
 </p><p>
 The arm between the elbow and wrist never increases by being bent or
 extended.
 </p><p>
 The arm, from the shoulder to the inner joint when extended.
 </p><p>
 When the arm is extended, <i>p n</i> is equal to <i>n a</i>. And when it is
 bent <i>n a</i> diminishes 1/6 of its length and <i>p n</i> does the same. The
 outer elbow joint increases 1/7 when bent; and thus by being bent it
 increases to the length of 2 heads. And on the inner
 </p><p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185</font></a></p>
 <p>side, by bending, it is found that whereas the arm from where it joins the
 side to the wrist, was 2 heads and a half, in bending it loses the
 half head and measures only two: one from the [shoulder] joint to
 the end [by the elbow], and the other to the hand.

 <p>
 The arm when folded will measure 2 faces up to the shoulder from the
 elbow and 2 from the elbow to the insertion of the four fingers on
 the palm of the hand. The length from the base of the fingers to the
 elbow never alters in any position of the arm.
 </p><p>
 If the arm is extended it decreases by 1/3 of the length between <i>b</i>
 and <i>h</i>; and if--being extended--it is bent, it will increase

 <p>the half of <i>o e</i>.  <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">168</font></a>
  The length from the
 shoulder to the elbow is the same as from the base of the thumb,
 inside, to the elbow <i>a b c</i>.
 </p><p>
  <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">169</font></a>
  The smallest thickness of the arm in profile <i>z c</i>
 goes 6 times between the knuckles of the hand and the dimple of the
 elbow when extended and 14 times in the whole arm and 42 in the
 whole man [64]. The greatest thickness of the arm in profile is
 equal to the greatest thickness of the arm in front; but the first
 is placed at a third of the arm from the shoulder joint to the elbow
 and the other at a third from the elbow towards the hand.

 <i>Queste cose</i>. This passage seems to have been written on purpose to
 rectify the foregoing lines. The error is explained by the
 accompanying sketch of the bones of the arm.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="0348.htm#fr_170">185:168</a>  59-61: The figure sketched in the margin is
 however drawn to different proportions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="0348.htm#fr_171">185:169</a>  62-64: The arm sketch on the margin of the MS. is
 identically the same as that given below on <a href="pl020.htm#img_pl020">Pl. XX</a> which may
 therefore be referred to in this place. In line 62 we read therefore
 <i>z c</i> for <i>m n</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_172"></a><a href="0348.htm#fr_172">185:170</a> : Compare <a href="pl017.htm#img_pl017">Pl. XVII</a>. Lines 1-10 and 11-15 are written in two
 columns below the extended arm, and at the tips of the fingers we
 find the words: <i>fine d'unghie</i> (ends of the nails). Part of the
 text--lines 22 to 25--is visible by the side of the sketches on <a href="pl035.htm#img_pl035">Pl. XXXV</a>, No. 1.</p>
