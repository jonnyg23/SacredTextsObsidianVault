 That beam which is more than 20 times as long as its greatest
 thickness will be of brief duration and will break in half; and

 remember, that the part built into the wall should be steeped in hot
 pitch and filleted with oak boards likewise so steeped. Each beam
 must pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with
 sufficient chaining, because in consequence of earthquakes the beams
 are often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and
 floors; whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls strongly
 together and the walls will hold the floors. Again I remind you
 never to put plaster over timber. Since by expansion and shrinking
 of the timber produced by damp and dryness such floors often crack,
 and once cracked their divisions gradually produce dust and an ugly
 effect. Again remember not to lay a floor on beams supported on
 arches; for, in time the floor which is made on beams settles
 somewhat in the middle while that part of the floor which rests on
 the arches remains in its place; hence, floors laid over two kinds
 of supports look, in time, as if they were made in hills  <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">407</font></a>

 19 M. RAVAISSON, in his edition of MS. A gives a very different
 rendering of this passage translating it thus: <i>Les planchers qui
 sont soutenus par deux differentes natures de supports paraissent
 avec le temps faits en voute a cholli</i>.</p>
