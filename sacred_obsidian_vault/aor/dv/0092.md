 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY WHEN AN OBJECT IS PLACED CLOSE TO THE EYE ITS EDGES ARE INDISTINCT.</h3>
 <p>
 When an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it, its
 edges must become too confused to be distinguished; as it happens
 with objects close to a light, which cast a large and indistinct
 shadow, so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it;
 in all cases of linear perspective,

 the eye acts in the same way as
 the light. And the reason is that the eye has one leading line (of
 vision) which dilates with distance and embraces with true
 discernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that
 are close. But since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which
 surround this chief central one and since these which are farthest
 from the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with
 accuracy, it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not
 at a due distance, but is too near for the central line to be able
 to discern the outlines of the object. So the edges fall within the
 lines of weaker discerning power, and these are to the function of
 the eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot
 take it. Thus these cannot take in the objects, but induce the
 central line of sight to turn upon them, when they have put them up.
 Hence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have
 confused outlines.
