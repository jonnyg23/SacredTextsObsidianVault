 Every point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which
 diverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same
 lines converge to a pyramid [imaging] both the colour and form. No
 sooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines
 and angles are produced from it; and these lines, distributing
 themselves and intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an
 infinite number of angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each
 opposite angle, will form a triangle having a form and proportion
 equal to the larger angle; and if the base goes twice into each of
 the 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same.
