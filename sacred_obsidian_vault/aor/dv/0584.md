 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW AN ANGRY MAN IS TO BE FIGURED.</h3>
 <p>

 his head against the ground, and with one knee on his ribs; his
 right arm and fist raised on high. His hair must be thrown up, his
 brow downcast and knit, his teeth clenched and the two corners of
 his mouth grimly set; his neck swelled and bent forward as he leans
 over his foe, and full of furrows.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW TO REPRESENT A MAN IN DESPAIR.</h3>
 <p>

 whole person leaning towards the earth; his hair flying in disorder.
