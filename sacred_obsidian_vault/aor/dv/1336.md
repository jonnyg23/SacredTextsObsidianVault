 the city of Calindrafy[ <a name="fr_341"></a><a href="#fn_341"><font size="1">7</font></a>], near to our frontiers. This city is
 situated at the base of that part of the Taurus mountains which is
 divided from the Euphrates and looks towards the peaks of the great
 Mount Taurus [ <a name="fr_342"></a><a href="#fn_342"><font size="1">8</font></a>] to the West [ <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">9</font></a>]. These peaks are of such a height
 that they seem to touch the sky, and in all the world there is no

 day-time, and being of the whitest stone [ <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">11</font></a>] it shines
 resplendently and fulfils the function to these Armenians which a
 bright moon-light would in the midst of the darkness; and by its
 great height it outreaches the utmost level of the clouds by a space
 of four miles in a straight line. This peak is seen in many places
 towards the West, illuminated by the sun after its setting the third
 part of the night. This it is, which with you [ <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">14</font></a>] we formerly
 in calm weather had supposed to be a comet, and appears to us in the
 darkness of night, to change its form, being sometimes divided in two
 or three parts, and sometimes long and sometimes short. And this is
 caused by the clouds on the horizon of the sky which interpose between
 part of this mountain and the sun, and by cutting off some of the solar
 rays the light on the mountain is intercepted by various intervals
 of clouds, and therefore varies in the form of its brightness.

  <a name="fr_353"></a><a href="#fn_353"><font size="1">54</font></a>I am not to be accused, Oh Devatdar, of idleness, as your chidings
 seem to hint; but your excessive love for me, which gave rise to the
 benefits you have conferred on me [55] is that which has
 also compelled me to the utmost painstaking in seeking out and
 diligently investigating the cause of so great and stupendous an
 effect. And this could not be done without time; now, in order to
 satisfy you fully as to the cause of so great an effect, it is
 requisite that I should explain to you the form of the place, and
 then I will proceed to the effect, by which I believe you will be
 amply satisfied.

 <p>[ <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_354"><font size="1">59</font></a>]Do not be aggrieved, O Devatdar, by my delay in responding to
 your pressing request, for those things which you require of me are
 of such a nature that they cannot be well expressed without some
 lapse of time; particularly because, in order to explain the cause
 of so great an effect, it is necessary to describe with accuracy the
 nature of the place; and by this means I can afterwards easily
 satisfy your above-mentioned request.[ <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_355"><font size="1">62</font></a>]
 </p><p>
 I will pass over any description of the form of Asia Minor, or as to
 what seas or lands form the limits of its outline and extent,
 because I know that by your own diligence and carefulness in your
 studies you have not remained in ignorance of these matters [65];
 and I will go on to describe the true form of the Taurus Mountain
 which is the cause of this stupendous and harmful marvel, and which
 will serve to advance us in our purpose [66]. This Taurus is that
 mountain which, with many others is said to be the ridge of Mount
 Caucasus; but wishing to be very clear about it, I desired to speak
 to some of the inhabitants of the shores of the Caspian sea, who
 give evidence that this must be the true Caucasus, and that though
 their mountains bear the same name, yet these are higher; and to
 confirm this in the Scythian tongue Caucasus means a very high <a name="fr_356"></a><a href="#fn_356"><font size="1">68</font></a>
 peak, and in fact we have no information of there being, in the East or in the
 West, any mountain so high. And the proof of this is that the
 inhabitants of the countries to the West see the rays of the sun
 illuminating a great part of its summit for as much as a quarter of
 the longest night. And in the same way, in those countries which lie
 to the East.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE STRUCTURE AND SIZE OF MOUNT TAURUS.</h3>
 <p>
 [ <a name="fr_357"></a><a href="#fn_357"><font size="1">73</font></a>] The shadow of this ridge of the Taurus is of such a height
 that when, in the middle of June, the Sun is at its meridian, its

 </p><p><a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 391</font></a></p>
 <p>shadow extends as far as the borders of Sarmatia, twelve days off;
 and in the middle of December it extends as far as the Hyperborean
 mountains, which are at a month's journey to the North [75]. And
 the side which faces the wind is always free from clouds and mists,
 because the wind which is parted in beating on the rock, closes
 again on the further side of that rock, and in its motion carries
 with it the clouds from all quarters and leaves them where it
 strikes. And it is always full of thunderbolts from the great
 quantity of clouds which accumulate there, whence the rock is all
 riven and full of huge d´bris[ <a name="fr_358"></a><a href="#fn_358"><font size="1">77</font></a>]. This mountain, at its base, is
 inhabited by a very rich population and is full of most beautiful
 springs and rivers, and is fertile and abounding in all good
 produce, particularly in those parts which face to the South. But
 after mounting about three miles we begin to find forests of great
 fir trees, and beech and other similar trees; after this, for a
 space of three more miles, there are meadows and vast pastures; and
 all the rest, as far as the beginning of the Taurus, is eternal snow
 </p><p>
 
 
 </p><p><a name="page_392"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 392</font></a></p>
 <p>which never disappear at any time, and extend to a height of
 about fourteen miles in all. From this beginning of the Taurus up to
 the height of a mile the clouds never pass away; thus we have
 fifteen miles, that is, a height of about five miles in a straight
 line; and the summit of the peaks of the Taurus are as much, or
 about that. There, half way up, we begin to find a scorching air and
 never feel a breath of wind; but nothing can live long there; there
 nothing is brought forth save a few birds of prey which breed in the
 high fissures of Taurus and descend below the clouds to seek their
 prey. Above the wooded hills all is bare rock, that is, from the
 clouds upwards; and the rock is the purest white. And it is
 impossible to walk to the high summit on account of the rough and
 perilous ascent.

 <p><a name="fn_335"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_335">385:1336</a> Lines 1-52 are reproduced in facsimile on <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_336"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_336">385:1</a> <i>Diodario.</i> This word is not to be found in any Italian
 dictionary, and for a long time I vainly sought an explanation of
 it. The youthful reminiscences of my wife afforded the desired clue.
 The chief town of each Turkish Villayet, or province --such as
 Broussa, for instance, in Asia Minor, is the residence of a
 Defterdar, who presides over the financial affairs of the province.
 <i>Defterdar hane</i> was, in former times, the name given to the
 Ministry of Finance at Constantinople; the Minister of Finance to
 the Porte is now known as the <i>Mallie-Nazri</i> and the <i>Defterdars</i>
 are his subordinates. A <i>Defterdar</i>, at the present day is merely
 the head of the finance department in each Provincial district. With
 regard to my suggestion that Leonardo's <i>Diodario</i> might be
 identical with the Defterdar of former times, the late M. C.
 DEFREMERIE, Arabic Professor, and Membre de l'Institut de France
 wrote to me as follows: <i>Votre conjecture est parfaitement fondee;
 diodario est Vequivalent de devadar ou plus exactement devatdar,
 titre d'une importante dignite en Egypt'e, sous les Mamlouks.</i>
 </p><p>
 The word however is not of Turkish, but of Perso-Arabie derivation.
 <i>Defter</i> (Arabic) means <i>folio</i>; for <i>dar</i> (Persian) Bookkeeper
 or holder is the English equivalent; and the idea is that of a deputy in command.
 During the Mamelook supremacy over Syria, which corresponded in date with
 Leonardo's time, the office of Defterdar was the third in importance
 in the State.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_337"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_337">385:2</a> <i>Soltano di Babilonia</i>. The name of Babylon was commonly applied to
 Cairo in the middle ages. For instance BREIDENBACH, <i>Itinerarium
 Hierosolyma</i> p. 218 says: "At last we reached Babylon. But this is
 not that Babylon which stood on the further shore of the river
 Chober, but that which is called the Egyptian Babylon. It is close
 by Cairo and the twain are but one and not two towns; one half is
 called Cairo and the other Babylon, whence they are called together
 Cairo-Babylon; originally the town is said to have been named
 Memphis and then Babylon, but now it is called Cairo." Compare No. 1085, 6.
 </p><p>
 Egypt was governed from 1382 till 1517 by the Borgite or
 Tcherkessian dynasty of the Mamelook Sultans. One of the most famous
 of these, Sultan Kait Bey, ruled from 1468-1496 during whose reign
 the Gama (or Mosque) of Kait Bey and tomb of Kait Bey near the
 Okella Kait Bey were erected in Cairo, which preserve his name to
 this day. Under the rule of this great and wise prince many
 foreigners, particularly Italians, found occupation in Egypt, as may
 be seen in the 'Viaggio di Josaphat Barbaro', among other
 travellers. "Next to Leonardo (so I learn from Prof. Jac. Burckhardt
 of Bale) Kait Bey's most helpful engineer was a German <a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 386</font></a> who in about
 1487, superintended the construction of the Mole at Alexandria.
 Felix Fabri knew him and mentions him in his <i>Historia Suevorum</i>,
 written in 1488."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_338"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_338">385:3</a> <i>Il nuovo accidente
 accaduto</i>, or as Leonardo first wrote and then erased, <i>e accaduto
 un nuovo accidente</i>. From the sequel this must refer to an
 earthquake, and indeed these were frequent at that period,
 particularly in Asia Minor, where they caused immense mischief. See
 No. 1101 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_339"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_339">386:4</a> The text here
 breaks off. The following lines are a fresh beginning of a letter,
 evidently addressed to the same person, but, as it would seem,
 written at a later date than the previous text. The numerous
 corrections and amendments amply prove that it is not a copy from
 any account of a journey by some unknown person; but, on the
 contrary, that Leonardo was particularly anxious to choose such
 words and phrases as might best express his own ideas.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_340"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_340">386:5</a> <i>Parti d'Erminia</i>. See No. 945, note. The extent of Armenia in Leonardo's
 time is only approximately known. In the XVth century the Persians
 governed the Eastern, and the Arabs the Southern portions. Arabic
 authors--as, for instance Abulfeda--include Cilicia and a part of
 Cappadocia in Armenia, and Greater Armenia was the tract of that
 country known later as Turcomania, while Armenia Minor was the
 territory between Cappadocia and the Euphrates. It was not till
 1522, or even 1574 that the whole country came under the dominion of
 the Ottoman Turks, in the reign of Selim I.
 </p><p>
 The Mamelook Sultans of Egypt seem to have taken a particular
 interest in this, the most Northern province of their empire, which
 was even then in danger of being conquered by the Turks. In the
 autumn of 1477 Sultan Kait Bey made a journey of inspection,
 visiting Antioch and the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates with a
 numerous and brilliant escort. This tour is briefly alluded to by
 <i>Moodshireddin</i> p. 561; and by WEIL, <i>Geschichte der Abbasiden</i> V,
 p. 358. An anonymous member of the suite wrote a diary of the
 expedition in Arabic, which has been published by R. V. LONZONE
 (<i>'Viaggio in Palestina e Soria di Kaid Ba XVIII sultano della II
 dinastia mamelucca, fatto nel 1477. Testo arabo. Torino 1878'</i>,
 without notes or commentary). Compare the critique on this edition,
 by J. GILDEMEISTER in <i>Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palaestina Vereins</i>
 (Vol. Ill p. 246--249). Lanzone's edition seems to be no more than
 an abridged copy of the original. I owe to Professor Sche'fer,
 Membre de l'Institut, the information that he is in possession of a
 manuscript in which the text is fuller, and more correctly given.
 The Mamelook dynasty was, as is well known, of Circassian origin,
 and a large proportion of the Egyptian Army was recruited in
 Circassia even so late as in the XVth century. That was a period of
 political storms in Syria and Asia Minor and it is easy to suppose
 that the Sultan's minister, to whom Leonardo addresses his report as
 his superior, had a special interest in the welfare of those
 frontier provinces. Only to mention a few historical events of
 Sultan Kait Bey's reign, we find that in 1488 he assisted the
 Circassians to resist the encroachments of Alaeddoulet, an Asiatic
 prince who had allied himself with the Osmanli to threaten the
 province; the consequence was a war in Cilicia by sea and land,
 which broke out in the following year between the contending powers.
 Only a few years earlier the same province had been the scene of the
 so-called Caramenian war in which the united Venetian, Neapolitan
 and Sclavonic fleets had been engaged. (See CORIALANO CIPPICO,
 <i>Della guerra dei Veneziani nell' Asia dal</i> 1469--1474. Venezia
 1796, p. 54) and we learn incidentally that a certain Leonardo
 Boldo, Governor of Scutari under Sultan Mahmoud,--as his name would
 indicate, one of the numerous renegades of Italian birth--played an
 important part in the negotiations for peace.
 </p><p>
 <i>Tu mi mandasti</i>. The address <i>tu</i> to a personage so high in office
 is singular and suggests personal intimacy; Leonardo seems to have
 been a favourite with the Diodario. Compare lines 54 and 55.
 </p><p>
 I have endeavoured to show, and I believe that I am also in a
 position to prove with regard to these texts, that they are draughts
 of letters actually written by Leonardo; at the same time I must not
 omit to mention that shortly after I had discovered <a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 387</font></a>
 these texts in the Codex Atlanticus and publi- shed a paper on the
 subject in the <i>Zeit- schrift fur bildende Kunst (Vol. XVI)</i>, Prof.
 Govi put forward this hypothesis to account for their origin:
 </p><p>
 <i>"Quanto alle notizie sul monte Tauro, sull'Armenia e sull' Asia
 minore che si contengono negli altri frammenti, esse vennero prese
 da qualche geografro o viaggiatore contemporaneo. Dall'indice
 imperfetto che accompagna quei frammenti, si potrebbe dedurre che
 Leonardo volesse farne un libro, che poi non venne compiuto. A ogni
 modo, non e possibile di trovare in questi brani nessun indizio di
 un viaggio di Leonardo in oriente, ne della sua conversione alla
 religione di Maometto, come qualcuno pretenderebbe. Leonardo amava
 con passione gli studi geografici, e nel suoi scritti s'incontran
 spesso itinerart, indicazioni, o descrizioni di luoghi, schizzi di
 carte e abbozzi topografici di varie regioni, non e quindi strano
 che egli, abile narratore com'era, si fosse proposto di scrivere una
 specie di Romanzo in forma epistolare svolgendone Pintreccio
 nell'Asia Minore, intorno alla quale i libri d'allora, e forse
 qualche viaggiatore amico suo, gli avevano somministrato alcuni
 elementi piu o meno</i> fantastici. (See Transunti della Reale Accademia
 dei Lincei Voi. V Ser. 3).
 </p><p>
 It is hardly necessary to point out that Prof. Govi omits to name
 the sources from which Leonardo could be supposed to have drawn his
 information, and I may leave it to the reader to pronounce judgment
 on the anomaly which is involved in the hypothesis that we have here
 a fragment of a Romance, cast in the form of a correspondence. At
 the same time, I cannot but admit that the solution of the
 difficulties proposed by Prof. Govi is, under the circumstances,
 certainly the easiest way of dealing with the question. But we
 should then be equally justified in supposing some more of
 Leonardo's letters to be fragments of such romances; particularly
 those of which the addresses can no longer be named. Still, as
 regards these drafts of letters to the Diodario, if we accept the
 Romance theory, as pro- posed by Prof. Govi, we are also compelled
 to assume that Leonardo purposed from the first to illustrate his
 tale; for it needs only a glance at the sketches on <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a> to CXIX
 to perceive that they are connected with the texts; and of course
 the rest of Leonardo's numerous notes on matters pertaining to the East,
 the greater part of which are here published for the first time, may also
 be somehow connected with this strange romance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_341"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_341">387:7</a> <i>Città de Calindra</i> (<i>Chalindra</i>). The position of this city is so
 exactly determined, between the valley of the Euphrates and the
 Taurus range that it ought to be possible to identify it. But it can
 hardly be the same as the sea port of Cilicia with a somewhat
 similar name Celenderis, Kelandria, Celendria, Kilindria, now the
 Turkish Gulnar. In two Catalonian Portulans in the Bibliothèque
 Nationale in Paris-one dating from the XV<sup>th</sup> century, by Wilhelm
 von Soler, the other by Olivez de Majorca, in l584--I find this place
 called Calandra. But Leonardo's Calindra must certainly have lain
 more to the North West, probably somewhere in Kurdistan. The fact
 that the geographical position is so carefully determined by
 Leonardo seems to prove that it was a place of no great importance
 and little known. It is singular that the words first written in l.
 8 were <i>divisa dal lago</i> (Lake Van?), altered afterwards to
 <i>dall'Eufrates</i>.
 </p><p>
 <i>Nostri confini</i>, and in 1. 6 <i>proposito nostro</i>. These refer to the
 frontier and to the affairs of the Mamelook Sultan, Lines 65 and 66
 throw some light on the purpose of Leonardo's mission.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_342"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_342">387:8</a> <i>I corni del gra mote Tauro</i>. Compare the sketches <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a>-CXVIII.
 So long as it is impossible to identify the situation
 of Calindra it is most difficult to decide with any certainty which
 peak of the Taurus is here meant; and I greatly regret that I had no
 foreknowledge of this puzzling topographical question when, in 1876,
 I was pursuing archaeological enquiries in the Provinces of Aleppo
 and Cilicia, and had to travel for some time in view of the imposing
 snow-peaks of Bulghar Dagh and Ala Tepessi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_343"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_343">387:9</a>-10 The opinion here expressed as to the height of the mountain
 would be unmeaning, unless it had been written before Leonardo moved
 to Milan, where Monte Rosa is so conspicuous an object in the
 landscape. 4 <i>ore inanzi</i> seems to mean, four hours before the sun's
 rays penetrate to the bottom of the valleys.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_344"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_344">388:11</a> <i>Pietra bianchissima</i>. The Taurus Mountains consist in great
 part of limestone.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_345"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_345">388:14</a> <i>Appresso di voi</i>. Leonardo had at first written <i>noi</i> as though his
 meaning had,been: This peak appeared to us to be a comet when you
 and I observed it in North Syria (at Aleppo? at Aintas?). The
 description of the curious reflection in the evening, resembling the
 "Alpine-glow" is certainly not an invented fiction, for in the next
 lines an explanation of the phenomenon is offered, or at least
 attempted.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_346"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_346">388:19</a> The next 33 lines are
 evidently the contents of a connected Report or Book, but not of one
 which he had at hand; more probably, indeed, of one he purposed
 writing.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_347"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_347">388:20</a> <i>Persuasione di fede</i>, of the Christian or the Mohammedan
 faith? We must suppose the latter, at the beginning of a document
 addressed to so high a Mohammedan official. <i>Predica</i> probably
 stands as an abbreviation for <i>predicazione</i> (lat. <i>praedicatio</i>)
 in the sense of praise or glorification; very probably it may mean
 some such initial doxology as we find in Mohammedan works. (Comp. 1. 40.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_348"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_348">388:28</a> The phraseology of this is too general for any conjecture
 as to its meaning to be worth hazarding.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_349"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_349">388:30</a> <i>Ruina del monte</i>. Of course by an earthquake. In a catalogue of
 earthquakes, entitled <i>kechf aussalssalèb an auasf ezzel-zelèh</i>,
 and written by Djelal eddin <a name="page_389"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 389</font></a> Syouthy, the following statement occurs:
 "In the year 889 (1484 A.D.) there were six shocks of earthquake
 at Aleppo. They were excessively violent
 and threw the inhabitants into consternation." I owe this
 communication to the kindness of Prof. Ch. Schefer, Membre de
 l'Institut, to whom this unpublished Arabic MS. belongs. The
 foregoing entries refer to two earthquakes in Cairo, in 1476 and
 1481: the following ones indicate a time at which Leonardo was,
 certainly, living in Milan.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_350"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_350">389:36</a> <i>Tagliata di Monte Tauro</i>. The Euphrates flows through the
 Taurus range near the influx of the Kura Shai; it rushes through a
 rift in the wildest cliffs from 2000 to 3000 feet high and runs on
 for 90 miles in 300 falls or rapids till it reaches Telek, near
 which at a spot called Gleikash, or the Hart's leap, it measures only 35
 paces across. Compare the map on <a href="pl119.htm#img_pl119">Pl. CXIX</a> and the explanation
 <a href="errata.htm#2">for</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_351"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_351">389:40</a> <i>Nova profeta</i>, 1. 33, <i>profeta</i>. Mohammed. Leonardo here
 refers to the Koran:
 </p><p>
 <i>In the name of the most merciful God.--When the earth shall be
 shaken by an earthquake; and the earth shall cast forth her burdens;
 and a man shall say, what aileth her? On that day the earth shall
 declare her tidings, for that thy Lord will inspire her. On that day
 men shall go forward in distinct classes, that they may behold their
 works. And whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant,
 shall behold the same. And whoever shall have wrought evil of the
 weight of an ant, shall behold the same.</i> (The Koran, translated by
 G. Sale, Chapter XCIX, p. 452).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_352"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_352">389:53</a>--94: The facsimile of this passage is given on <a href="pl117.htm#img_pl117">Pl. CXVII</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_353"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_353">389:54</a> The foregoing sketch of a letter, lines 5. 18, appears to
 have remained a fragment when Leonardo received pressing orders
 which caused him to write immediately and fully on the subject
 mentioned in line 43.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_354"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_354">390:59</a> This passage was evidently intended as an improvement
 on that immediately preceding it. The purport of both is essentially
 the same, but the first is pitched in a key of ill-disguised
 annoyance which is absent from the second. I do not see how these
 two versions can be reconciled with the romance-theory held by Prof.
 Govi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_355"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_355">390:62</a> This passage was evidently intended as an improvement on that

 <p><a name="fn_356"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_356">390:68</a> Caucasus; Herodot Καύχασις; Armen. Kaukaz.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_357"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_357">390:73</a>--75: The statements are of course founded on those of the
 'inhabitants' spoken of in l. 67.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_358"></a><a href="1336.htm#fr_358">391:77</a> Sudden storms are equally common on the heights of Ararat.
 It is hardly necessary to observe that Ararat cannot be meant here.
 Its summit is formed like the crater of Vesuvius. The peaks sketched
 on <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a>-CXVIII are probably views of the same mountain, taken
 from different sides. Near the solitary peak, <a href="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</a> these three
 names are written <i>goba, arnigasar, caruda</i>, names most likely of
 different peaks. <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a> and <a href="pl117.htm#img_pl117">CXVII</a> are in the original on a single
 sheet folded down the middle, 30 centimetres high and 43 1/2 wide.
 On the reverse of one half of the sheet are notes on <i>peso</i> and <i>bilancia</i> 
 (weight and balance), on the other are the 'prophecies' printed under
 Nos. 1293 and 1294. It is evident from the arrangement that these were written
 subsequently, on the space which had been left blank. These pages
 are facsimiled on <a href="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</a>. In <a href="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</a>-CXVIII the size is smaller
 than in the original; the map of Armenia, <a href="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</a>, is on <a href="pl119.htm#img_pl119">Pl. CXIX</a>
 slightly enlarged. On this map we find the following names,
 beginning from the right hand at the top: <i>pariardes mo</i> (for
 Paryadres Mons, Arm. Parchar, now Barchal or Kolai Dagh; Trebizond
 is on its slope).
 </p><p>
 <i>Aquilone</i> --North, <i>Antitaurus Antitaurus psis mo</i> ///// (probably
 meant for Thospitis = Lake Van, Arm. Dgov Vanai, Tospoi, and the
 Mountain range to the South); <i>Gordis mo</i> (Mountains of Gordyaea),
 the birth place of the Tigris; <i>Oriente</i> --East; <i>Tigris</i>, and then,
 to the left, <i>Eufrates</i>. Then, above to the left <i>Argeo mo</i> (now
 Erdshigas, an extinct volcano, 12000 feet high); <i>Celeno mo</i> (no
 doubt Sultan Dagh in Pisidia). Celeno is the Greek town of
 Κελαιναί-- see Arian I, 29, I--<font size="-1" color="green">(</font>now the ruins of Dineir); <i>oriente</i>
 --East; <i>africo libezco</i> (for libeccio--South West). In the middle
 of the Euphrates river on this small map we see a shaded portion
 surrounded by mountains, perhaps to indicate the inundation
 mentioned in l. 35. The affluent to the Euphrates shown as coming
 with many windings from the high land of 'Argeo' on the West, is the
 Tochma Su, which joins the main river at Malatie. I have not been
 able to discover any map of Armenia of the XVth or XVIth century in
 which the course of the Euphrates is laid down with any thing like
 the correctness displayed in this sketch. The best I have seen is
 the Catalonian Portulan of Olivez de Majorca, executed in 1584, and
 it is far behind Leonardo's.</p>
