 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The practice of the prospettiva de colori.</font></span>In order to put into practice this perspective of the variation and
 loss or diminution of the essential character of colours, observe at
 every hundred braccia some objects standing in the landscape, such
 as trees, houses, men and particular places. Then in front of the
 first tree have a very steady plate of glass and keep your eye very
 steady, and then, on this plate of glass, draw a tree, tracing it
 over the form of that tree. Then move it on one
 </p><p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>
 <p>side so far as that
 the real tree is close by the side of the tree you have drawn; then
 colour your drawing in such a way as that in colour and form the two
 may be alike, and that both, if you close one eye, seem to be
 painted on the glass and at the same distance. Then, by the same
 method, represent a second tree, and a third, with a distance of a
 hundred braccia between each. And these will serve as a standard and
 guide whenever you work on your own pictures, wherever they may
 apply, and will enable you to give due distance in those works. [14]
 But I have found that as a rule the second is 4/5 of the first when
 it is 20 braccia beyond it.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_129"></a><a href="0294.htm#fr_129">159:127</a> : This chapter is one of those copied in the Manuscript of
 the Vatican library Urbinas 1270, and the original text is rendered
 here with no other alterations, but in the orthography. H. LUDWIG,
 in his edition of this copy translates lines 14 and 15 thus: "<i>Ich
 finde aber als Regel, dass der zweite um vier Funftel des ersten
 abnimmt, wenn er namlich zwanzig Ellen vom ersten entfernt ist
 (?)"</i>. He adds in his commentary: "<i>Das Ende der Nummer ist wohl
 jedenfalls verstummelt</i>". However the translation given above shows
 that it admits of a different rendering.</p>
