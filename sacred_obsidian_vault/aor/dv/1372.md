 <p><a name="fn_393"></a><a href="1372.htm#fr_393">416:699</a> : This statement of Ser Piero's age contradicts that of the
 <i>Riassunto della portata di Antonio da Vinci</i> (Leonardo's
 grandfather), who speaks of Ser Piero as being thirty years old in
 1457; and that of the <i>Riassunto della portata di Ser Piero e
 Francesco</i>, sons of Antonia da Vinci, where Ser Piero is mentioned
 as being forty in 1469. These documents were published by G.
 UZIELLI, <i>Ricerche intorno a L. da Vinci, Firenze</i>, 1872, pp. 144
 and 146. Leonardo was, as is well known, a natural son. His mother
 'La Catarina' was married in 1457 to Acchattabriga di Piero del
 Vaccha da Vinci. She died in 1519. Leonardo never mentions her in
 the Manuscripts. In the year of Leonardo's birth Ser Piero married
 Albiera di Giovanni Amadoci, and after her death at the age of
 thirty eight he again married, Francesca, daughter of Ser Giovanni
 Lanfredi, then only fifteen. Their children were Leonardo's
 halfbrothers, Antonio (b. 1476), Ser Giuliano (b. 1479), Lorenzo (b.
 1484), a girl, Violante (b. 1485), and another boy Domenico (b.
 1486); Domenico's descendants still exist as a family. Ser Piero
 married for the third time Lucrezia di Guglielmo Cortigiani by whom
 he had six children: Margherita (b. 1491), Benedetto (b. 1492),
 Pandolfo (b. 1494), Guglielmo (b. 1496), Bartolommeo (b. 1497), and
 Giovanni) date of birth unknown). Pierino da Vinci the sculptor
 (about 1520-1554) was the son of Bartolommeo, the fifth of these
 children. The dates of their deaths are not known, but we may infer
 from the above passage that they were all still living in 1505.</p>
