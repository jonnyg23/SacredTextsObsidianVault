 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE NATURE OF THE FOLDS IN DRAPERY.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On draperies (390--392).</font></span>That part of a fold which is farthest from the ends where it is
 confined will fall most nearly in its natural form.
 </p><p>
 Every thing by nature tends to remain at rest. Drapery, being of
 equal density and thickness on its wrong side and on its right, has
 a tendency to lie flat; therefore when you give it a fold or plait
 forcing it out of its flatness note well the result of the
 constraint in the part where it is most confined; and the part which
 is farthest from this constraint you will see relapses most into the
 natural state; that is to say lies free and flowing.

  Let <i>a b c</i> be the fold of the
 drapery spoken of above, <i>a c</i> will be the places where this folded
 drapery is held fast. I maintain that the part of the drapery which
 is farthest from the plaited ends will revert most to its natural
 form.
 </p><p>
 Therefore, <i>b</i> being farthest from <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> in the fold <i>a b c</i>
 it will be wider there than anywhere else.
