 First you must consider whether the figures have the relief required
 by their situation and the light which illuminates them; for the
 shadows should not be the same at the extreme ends of the
 composition as in the middle, because it is one thing when figures
 are surrounded by shadows and another when they have shadows only on
 one side. Those which are in the middle of the picture are
 surrounded by shadows, because they are shaded by the figures which
 stand between them and the light. And those are lighted on one side
 only which stand between the principal group and the light, because
 where they do not look towards the light they face the group and the
 darkness of the group is thrown on them: and where they do not face
 the group they face the brilliant light and it is their own darkness
 shadowing them, which appears there.

 In the second place observe the distribution or arrangement of
 figures, and whether they are distributed appropriately to the
 circumstances of the story. Thirdly, whether the figures are
 actively intent on their particular business.
