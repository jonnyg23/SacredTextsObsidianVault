 <p>
 If <i>a</i> is the light, and <i>b</i> illuminated by it in a direct line,
 <i>c</i>, on which the light cannot fall, is lighted only by reflection
 from <i>b</i> which, let us say, is red. Hence the light reflected from
 it, will be affected by the hue of the surface causing it and will
 tinge the surface <i>c</i> with red. And if <i>c</i> is also red you will see
 it much more intense than <i>b</i>; and if it were yellow you would see
 there a colour between yellow and red.
