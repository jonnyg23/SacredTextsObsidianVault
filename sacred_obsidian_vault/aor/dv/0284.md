 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the use of dark and light colours in painting (284--286).</font></span>Since we see that the quality of colour is known [only] by means of
 light, it is to be supposed that where there is most light the true
 character of a colour in light will be best seen; and where there is
 most shadow the colour will be affected by the tone of that. Hence,
 O Painter! remember to show the true quality of colours in bright
 lights.
