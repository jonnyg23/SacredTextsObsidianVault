 Perspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite
 pyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as
 distant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and
 the apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]
 universe, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of
 the eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small
 opening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the
 greater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid
 is constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,
 as has been said. The second pyramid is extended to a spot which is
 smaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye; and this second
 perspective [= pyramid] results from the first.
