 1, The superficies is a limitation of the body. 2, and the
 limitation of a body is no part of that body. 4, and the limitation

 If one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of
 an infinite number of lines, and the termination of an infinite
 number of lines, there must be an infinite number of points
 separable from this point, and these when reunited become one again;
 whence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole.
