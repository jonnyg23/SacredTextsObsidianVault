 , of which the first treats of objects seen by the eye at
 any distance; and it shows all these objects just as the eye sees
 them diminished, without obliging a man to stand in one place rather
 than another so long as the plane does not produce a second
 foreshortening.
 </p><p>
 But the second practice is a combination of perspective derived
 partly from art and partly from nature and the work done by its
 rules is in
 </p><p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p>
 <p>every portion of it, influenced by natural perspective
 and artificial perspective. By natural perspective I mean that the
 plane on which this perspective is represented is a flat surface,
 and this plane, although it is parallel both in length and height,
 is forced to diminish in its remoter parts more than in its nearer
 ones. And this is proved by the first of what has been said above,
 and its diminution is natural. But artificial perspective, that is
 that which is devised by art, does the contrary; for objects equal
 in size increase on the plane where it is foreshortened in
 proportion as the eye is more natural and nearer to the plane, and
 as the part of the plane on which it is figured is farther from the
 eye.

 And let this plane be <i>d e</i> on which are seen 3 equal circles which
 are beyond this plane <i>d e</i>, that is the circles <i>a b c</i>. Now you
 see that the eye <i>h</i> sees on the vertical plane the sections of the
 images, largest of those that are farthest and smallest of the
 nearest.
