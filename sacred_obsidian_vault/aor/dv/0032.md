 The pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is
 evident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those
 in the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up
 at these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and
 if you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you
 would see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil
 would exercise its function.
