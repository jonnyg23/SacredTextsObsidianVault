 <h3 align="CENTER"><i>Botany for Painters and Elements of Landscape Painting.</i></h3>
 <p>
 <i>The chapters composing this portion of the work consist of
 observations on Form, Light and Shade in Plants, and particularly in
 Trees summed up in certain general rules by which the author intends
 to guide the artist in the pictorial representation of landscape.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>With these the first principles of a</i> Theory of Landscape painting
 <i>are laid down--a theory as profoundly thought out in its main
 lines as it is lucidly worked out in its details. In reading these
 chapters the conviction is irresistible that such a</i> Botany for
 painters <i>is or ought to be of similar importance in the practice of
 painting as the principles of the Proportions and Movements of the
 human figure</i> i. e. Anatomy for painters.
 </p><p>
 <i>There can be no doubt that Leonardo, in laying down these rules,
 did not intend to write on Botany in the proper scientific
 sense--his own researches on that subject have no place here; it
 need only be observed that they are easily distinguished by their
 character and contents from those which are here collected and
 arranged under the title 'Botany for painters'. In some cases where
 this division might appear doubtful,--as for instance in No.</i>
 402--<i>the Painter is directly addressed and enjoined to take the
 rule to heart as of special importance in his art.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The original materials are principally derived from MS.</i> G, <i>in
 which we often find this subject treated on several pages in
 succession without any of that intermixture of other matters, which
 is so frequent in Leonardo's writings. This MS., too, is one of the
 latest; when it was written, the great painter was already more than
 sixty years of age, so we can scarcely doubt that he regarded all he
 wrote as his final views on the subject. And the same remark applies
 to the chapters from MSS.</i> E <i>and</i> M <i>which were also written
 between</i> 1513--15.
 </p><p>
 <i>For the sake of clearness, however, it has been desirable to
 sacrifice--with few exceptions--the original order of the passages
 as written, though it was with much reluctance and only after long
 hesitation that I resigned myself to this necessity. Nor do I mean
 to impugn the logical connection of the author's ideas in his MS.;
 but it</i>

 <p><i>will be easily understood that the sequence of disconnected
 notes, as they occurred to Leonardo and were written down from time
 to time, might be hardly satisfactory as a systematic arrangement of
 his principles. The reader will find in the Appendix an exact
 account of the order of the chapters in the original MS. and from
 the data there given can restore them at will. As the materials are
 here arranged, the structure of the tree as regards the growth of
 the branches comes first</i> (394-411) <i>and then the insertion of the
 leaves on the stems</i> (412-419). <i>Then follow the laws of Light and
 Shade as applied, first, to the leaves (420-434), and, secondly, to
 the whole tree and to groups of trees</i> (435-457). <i>After the remarks
 on the Light and Shade in landscapes generally</i> (458-464), <i>we find
 special observations on that of views of towns and buildings</i>
 (465-469). <i>To the theory of Landscape Painting belong also the
 passages on the effect of Wind on Trees</i> (470-473) <i>and on the Light
 and Shade of Clouds</i> (474-477), <i>since we find in these certain
 comparisons with the effect of Light and Shade on Trees</i> (e. g.: <i>in
 No.</i> 476, 4. 5; <i>and No.</i> 477, 9. 12). <i>The chapters given in the
 Appendix Nos.</i> 478 <i>and</i> 481 <i>have hardly any connection with the
 subjects previously treated.</i>
