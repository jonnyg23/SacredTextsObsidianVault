 there are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up
 to this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is
 placed towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids
 without bases;
 </p><p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p>as shown in the example given above. Now, let <i>a b</i>
 be the said vertical plane and <i>r</i> the point of the pyramid
 terminating in the eye, and <i>n</i> the point of diminution which is
 always in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the
 eye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves
 with it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point
 is the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the
 intervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their
 angles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the
 termination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:
 "By what practical experience can you show me these points?" I
 reply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you
 --when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows
 which come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,
 and you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they
 tried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.

 connection with the preceding I may here remark that the square
 plane shown above in profile by the line <i>c s</i> is here indicated by
 <i>e d o p</i>. According to lines 1, 3 <i>a b</i> must be imagined as a plane
 of glass placed perpendicularly at <i>o p</i>.</p>
