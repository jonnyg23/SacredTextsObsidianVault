 That there are springs which suddenly break forth in earthquakes or
 other convulsions and suddenly fail; and this happened in a mountain
 in Savoy where certain forests sank in and left a very deep gap, and
 about four miles from here the earth opened itself like a gulf in
 the mountain, and threw out a sudden and immense flood of water
 which scoured the whole of a little valley of the tilled soil,
 vineyards and houses, and did the greatest mischief, wherever it
 overflowed.
