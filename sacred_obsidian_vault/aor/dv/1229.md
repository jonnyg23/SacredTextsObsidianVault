 <p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">LIES.</h3>
 <p>
 The mole has very small eyes and it always lives under ground; and
 it lives as long as it is in the dark but when it comes into the
 light it dies immediately, because it becomes known;--and so it is
 with lies.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">VALOUR.</h3>
 <p>
 The lion is never afraid, but rather fights with a bold spirit and
 savage onslaught against a multitude of hunters, always seeking to
 injure the first that injures him.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">FEAR OR COWARDICE.</h3>
 <p>
 The hare is always frightened; and the leaves that fall from the
 trees in autumn always keep him in terror and generally put him to
 flight.
