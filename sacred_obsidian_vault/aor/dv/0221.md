 A body illuminated by the solar rays passing between the thick
 branches of trees will produce as many shadows as there are branches
 between the sun and itself.

 Where the shadow-rays from an opaque pyramidal body are intercepted
 they will cast a shadow of bifurcate outline and various depth at
 the points. A light which is broader than the apex but narrower than
 the base

 <p>of an opaque pyramidal body placed in front of it, will
 cause that pyramid to cast a shadow of bifurcate form and various
 degrees of depth.
 </p><p>
 If an opaque body, smaller than the light, casts two shadows and if
 it is the same size or larger, casts but one, it follows that a
 pyramidal body, of which part is smaller, part equal to, and part
 larger than, the luminous body, will cast a bifurcate shadow.
