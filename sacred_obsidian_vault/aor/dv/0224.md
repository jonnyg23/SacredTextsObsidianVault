 Every visible body, in so far as it affects the eye, includes three
 attributes; that is to say: mass, form and colour; and the mass is
 recognisable at a greater distance from the place of its actual
 existence than either colour or form. Again, colour is discernible
 at a greater distance than form, but this law does not apply to
 luminous bodies.

 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> An illustration by experiment.</font></span>The above proposition is plainly shown and proved by experiment;
 because: if you see a man close to you, you discern the exact
 appearance of the mass and of the form and also of the colouring; if
 he goes to some distance you will not recognise who he is, because
 the character of the details will disappear, if he goes still
 farther you will not be able to distinguish his colouring, but he
 will appear as a dark object, and still farther he will appear as a
 very small dark rounded object. It appears rounded because distance
 so greatly diminishes the various details that nothing remains
 visible but the larger mass. And the reason is this: We know very
 well that all the images of objects reach the senses by a small
 aperture in the eye; hence, if the whole horizon <i>a d</i> is admitted
 through such an aperture, the object <i>b c</i> being but a very small
 fraction of this horizon what space can it fill in that

 of so vast a hemisphere? And because luminous bodies have more power
 in darkness than any others, it is evident that, as the chamber of
 the eye is very dark, as is the nature of all colored cavities, the
 images of distant objects are confused and lost in the great light
 of the sky; and if they are visible at all, appear dark and black,
 as every small body must when seen in the diffused light of the
 atmosphere.
