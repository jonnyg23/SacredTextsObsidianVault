 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHAT SORT OF THING THE MOON IS.</h3>
 <p>
 The moon is not of itself luminous, but is highly fitted to
 assimilate the character of light after the manner of a mirror, or
 of water, or of any other reflecting body; and it grows larger in
 the East and in the West, like the sun and the other planets. And
 the reason is that every luminous body looks

 larger in proportion as
 it is remote. It is easy to understand that every planet and star is
 farther from us when in the West than when it is overhead, by about
 3500 miles, as is proved on the margin  <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">475</font></a>
 , and if you see the sun or moon mirrored in the
 water near to you, it looks to you of the same size in the water as
 in the sky. But if you recede to the distance of a mile, it will
 look 100 times larger; and if you see the sun reflected in the sea
 at sunset, its image would look to you more than 10 miles long;
 because that reflected image extends over more than 10 miles of sea.
 And if you could stand where the moon is, the sun would look to you,
 as if it were reflected from all the sea that it illuminates by day;
 and the land amid the water would appear just like the dark spots
 that are on the moon, which, when looked at from our earth, appears
 to men the same as our earth would appear to any men who might dwell
 in the moon.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE NATURE OF THE MOON.</h3>
 <p>
 When the moon is entirely lighted up to our sight, we see its full
 daylight; and at that time, owing to the reflection of the solar
 rays which fall on it and are thrown off towards us, its ocean casts
 off less moisture towards us; and the less light it gives the more
 injurious it is.
