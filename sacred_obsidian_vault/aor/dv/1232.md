 </p><h3 align="CENTER">INCONTINENCE.</h3>
 <p>
 The unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control
 itself, for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity
 and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated
 damsel and go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HUMILITY.</h3>
 <p>
 We see the most striking example of humility in the lamb which will
 submit to any animal; and when they are given for food to imprisoned
 lions they are as gentle to them as to their own mother, so that
 very often it has been seen that the lions forbear to kill them.
