 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the human body in action (380-388).</font></span>When you want to represent a man as moving some weight consider what
 the movements are that are to be represented by different lines;
 that is to say either from below upwards, with a simple movement, as
 a man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift
 as he straightens himself. Or as a man does who wants to squash
 something backwards, or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards
 with ropes passed through pullies  <a name="fr_190"></a><a href="#fn_190"><font size="1">188</font></a>
 . And here remember that
 the weight of a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is
 distant from his fulcrum, and to this is added the force given by
 his legs and bent back as he raises himself.
