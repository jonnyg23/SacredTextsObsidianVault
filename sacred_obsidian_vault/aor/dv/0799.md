 <p>
 First draw the bones, let us say, of the arm, and put in the motor
 muscle from the shoulder to the elbow with all its lines. Then
 proceed in the same way from the elbow to the wrist. Then from the
 wrist to the hand and from the hand to the fingers.
 </p><p>
 And in the arm you will put the motors of the fingers which open,
 and these you will show separately in their demonstration. In the
 second demonstration you will clothe these muscles with the
 secondary motors of the fingers and so proceed by degrees to avoid
 confusion. But first lay on the bones those muscles which lie close
 to the said bones, without confusion of other muscles; and with
 these you may put the nerves and veins which supply their
 nourishment, after having first drawn the tree of veins and nerves
 over the simple bones.
