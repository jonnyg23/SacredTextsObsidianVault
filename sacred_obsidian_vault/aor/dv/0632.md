 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TO RESTORE OIL COLOURS THAT HAVE BECOME DRY.</h3>
 <p>
 If you want to restore oil colours that have become dry keep them
 soaking in soft soap for a night and, with your finger, mix them up
 with the soft soap; then pour them into a cup and wash them with
 water, and in this way you can restore colours that have got dry.
 But take care that each colour has its own vessel to itself adding
 the colour by degrees as you restore it and mind that they are
 thoroughly softened, and when you wish to use them for tempera wash
 them five and six times with spring water, and leave them to settle;
 if the soft soap should be thick with any of the colours pass it
 through a filter.  <a name="fr_295"></a><a href="#fn_295"><font size="1">293</font></a>
