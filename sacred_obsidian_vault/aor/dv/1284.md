 Franciscan begging Friars are wont, at certain times, to keep fasts,
 when they do not eat meat in their convents. But on journeys, as
 they live on charity, they have license to eat whatever is set
 before them. Now a couple of these friars on their travels, stopped
 at an inn, in company with a certain merchant, and sat down with him
 at the same table, where, from the poverty of the inn, nothing was
 served to them but a small roast chicken. The merchant, seeing this
 to be but little even for himself, turned to the friars and said:
 "If my memory serves me, you do not eat any kind of flesh in your
 convents at this season." At these words the friars were compelled
 by their rule to admit, without cavil, that this was the truth; so
 the merchant had his wish, and eat the chicken and the friars did
 the best they could. After dinner the messmates departed, all three
 together, and after travelling some distance they came to a river of
 some width and depth. All three being on foot--the friars by reason
 of their poverty, and the other from avarice--it was necessary by
 the custom of company that one of the friars, being barefoot, should
 carry the merchant on his shoulders: so having given his wooden
 shoes into his keeping, he took up his man. But it so happened that
 when the friar had got to the middle of the river, he again
 remembered a rule of his order, and stopping short, he looked up,
 like Saint Christopher, to the burden on his back and said: "Tell
 me, have you any money about you?"--"You know I have", answered the
 other, "How do you suppose that a Merchant like me should go about
 otherwise?" "Alack!" cried the friar, "our rules forbid as to carry
 any money on our persons," and forthwith he dropped him into the
 water, which the merchant perceived was a facetious way of being
 revenged on the indignity he had done them; so, with a smiling face,
 and blushing somewhat with shame, he peaceably endured the revenge.
