 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE DIMINUTION IN PERSPECTIVE OF OPAQUE OBJECTS.</h3>
 <p>
 Among opaque objects of equal size the apparent diminution of size
 will be in proportion to their distance from the eye of the
 spectator; but it is an inverse proportion, since, where the
 distance is greater, the opaque body will appear smaller, and the
 less the distance the larger will the object appear. And this is the
 fundamental principle of linear perspective and it
 follows:--[11]every object as it becomes more remote loses first
 those parts which are smallest. Thus of a horse, we should lose the
 legs before the head, because the legs are thinner than the head;
 and the neck before the body for the same reason. Hence it follows
 that the last part of the horse which would be discernible by the
 eye would be the mass of the body in an oval

 <p>form, or rather in a
 cylindrical form and this would lose its apparent thickness before
 its length--according to the 2nd rule given above, &amp;c  <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">111</font></a>

 If the eye remains stationary the perspective terminates in the
 distance in a point. But if the eye moves in a straight [horizontal]
 line the perspective terminates in a line and the reason is that
 this line is generated by the motion of the point and our sight;
 therefore it follows that as we move our sight [eye], the point
 moves, and as we move the point, the line is generated, &amp;c
