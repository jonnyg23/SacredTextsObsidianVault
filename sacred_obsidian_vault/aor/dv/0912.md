 <h3 align="CENTER">WHETHER THE STARS HAVE THEIR LIGHT FROM THE SUN OR IN THEMSELVES.</h3>
 <p>
 Some say that they shine of themselves, alledging that if Venus and
 Mercury had not a light of their own, when they come between our
 eye and the sun they would darken so much of the sun as they could
 cover from our eye. But this is false, for it is proved that
 a dark object against a luminous body is enveloped and entirely concealed by
 the lateral rays of the rest of that luminous body and so remains invisible.

 <p>when the sun is seen through the boughs of trees bare of their
 leaves, at some distance the branches do not conceal any portion of
 the sun from our eye. The same thing happens with the above
 mentioned planets which, though they have no light of their own, do
 not--as has been said--conceal any part of the sun from our eye
 [18].

 <p>
 Some say that the stars appear most brilliant at night in proportion
 as they are higher up; and that if they had no light of their own,
 the shadow of the earth which comes between them and the sun, would
 darken them, since they would not face nor be faced by the solar
 body. But those persons have not considered that the conical shadow
 of the earth cannot reach many of the stars; and even as to those it
 does reach, the cone is so much diminished that it covers very
 little of the star's mass, and all the rest is illuminated by the
 sun.
