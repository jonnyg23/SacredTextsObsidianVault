 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE DELUGE AND OF MARINE SHELLS.</h3>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> That marine shells could not go up the mountains.</font></span><p>
 If you were to say that the shells which are to be seen within the
 confines of Italy now, in our days, far from the sea and at such
 heights, had been brought there by the deluge which left them there,
 I should answer that if you believe that this deluge rose 7 cubits
 above the highest mountains-- as he who measured it has
 written--these shells, which always live near the sea-shore, should
 have been left on the mountains; and not such a little way from the
 foot of the mountains; nor all at one level, nor in layers upon
 layers. And if you were to say that these shells are desirous of
 remaining near to the margin of the sea, and that, as it rose in
 height, the shells quitted their first home, and followed the
 increase of the waters up to their highest level; to this I answer,
 that the cockle is an animal of not more rapid movement than the
 snail is out of water, or even somewhat
 </p><p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>
 <p>slower; because it does not
 swim, on the contrary it makes a furrow in the sand by means of its
 sides, and in this furrow it will travel each day from 3 to 4
 braccia; therefore this creature, with so slow a motion, could not
 have travelled from the Adriatic sea as far as Monferrato in
 Lombardy  <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">521</font></a>
 , which is 250 miles
 distance, in 40 days; which he has said who took account of the
 time. And if you say that the waves carried them there, by their
 gravity they could not move, excepting at the bottom. And if you
 will not grant me this, confess at least that they would have to
 stay at the summits of the highest mountains, in the lakes which are
 enclosed among the mountains, like the lakes of Lario, or of Como
 and il Maggiore  <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">522</font></a>
  and of Fiesole, and of
 Perugia, and others.
 </p><p>
 And if you should say that the shells were carried by the waves,
 being empty and dead, I say that where the dead went they were not
 far removed from the living; for in these mountains living ones are
 found, which are recognisable by the shells being in pairs; and they
 are in a layer where there are no dead ones; and a little higher up
 they are found, where they were thrown by the waves, all the dead
 ones with their shells separated, near to where the rivers fell into
 the sea, to a great depth; like the Arno which fell from the
 Gonfolina near to Monte Lupo  <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_189"><font size="1">523</font></a>
 , where it left a deposit of
 gravel which may still be seen, and which has agglomerated; and of
 stones of various districts, natures, and colours and hardness,
 making one single conglomerate. And a little beyond the sandstone
 conglomerate a tufa has been formed, where it turned towards Castel
 Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells
 lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the
 turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom
 of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be
 seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by
 </p><p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>
 <p>the Arno which is
 wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of
 shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and
 various marine objects are found there. And if the earth of our
 hemisphere is indeed raised by so much higher than it used to be, it
 must have become by so much lighter by the waters which it lost
 through the rift between Gibraltar and Ceuta; and all the more the
 higher it rose, because the weight of the waters which were thus
 lost would be added to the earth in the other hemisphere. And if the
 shells had been carried by the muddy deluge they would have been
 mixed up, and separated from each other amidst the mud, and not in
 regular steps and layers-- as we see them now in our time.

 come upon a digression treating of the weight of water; this has
 here been omitted. It is 11 lines long.</p>
