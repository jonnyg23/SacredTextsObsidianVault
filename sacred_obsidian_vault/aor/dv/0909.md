 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On instruments for observing the moon (909. 910).</font></span>If you want to prove why the moon appears larger than it is, when it
 reaches the horizon; take a lens which is highly convex on one
 surface and concave on the opposite, and place the concave side next
 the eye, and look at the object beyond the convex surface; by this
 means you will have produced an exact imitation of the atmosphere
 included beneath the sphere of fire and outside that of water; for
 this atmosphere is concave on the side next the earth, and convex
 towards the fire.
