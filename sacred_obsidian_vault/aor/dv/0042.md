 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The elements of perspective--Of the Point (42-46).</font></span>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of
 mathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the angle, the
 superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the
 point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is
 to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.
 The line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has
 neither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible,
 excepting in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is
 the junction of two lines in a point.
