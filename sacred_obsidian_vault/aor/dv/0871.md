 <i>a b</i> is the aperture through which the sun passes, and if you could
 measure the size of the solar rays at <i>n m</i>, you could accurately
 trace the real lines of the convergence of the solar rays, the
 mirror being at <i>a b</i>, and then show the reflected rays at

 equal angles to <i>n m</i>; but, as you want to have them at <i>n m</i>, take them
 at the. inner side of the aperture at <i>c d</i>, where they maybe measured
 at the spot where the solar rays fall. Then place your mirror at the
 distance <i>a b</i>, making the rays <i>d b</i>, <i>c a</i> fall and then be
 reflected at equal angles towards <i>c d</i>; and this is the best
 method, but you must use this mirror always in the same month, and
 the same day, and hour and instant, and this will be better than at
 no fixed time because when the sun is at a certain distance it
 produces a certain pyramid of rays.
