 <h3 align="CENTER">THE DIVISION OF THE PROPHECIES.</h3>
 <p>
 First, of things relating to animals; secondly, of irrational
 creatures; thirdly of plants; fourthly, of ceremonies; fifthly, of
 manners; sixthly, of cases or edicts or quarrels; seventhly, of
 cases that are impossible in nature [paradoxes], as, for instance,
 of those things which, the more is taken from them, the more they
 grow. And reserve the great matters till the end, and the small
 matters give at the beginning. And first show the evils and then the
 punishment of philosophical things.
 </p><p>
 Of Ants.
 </p><p>
 These creatures will form many communities, which will hide
 themselves and their young ones and victuals in dark caverns, and
 they will feed themselves and their families in dark places for many
 months without any light, artificial or natural.

 <p></p><p>
 (Of Bees.)
 </p><p>
 And many others will be deprived of their store and their food, and
 will be cruelly submerged and drowned by folks devoid of reason. Oh
 Justice of God! Why dost thou not wake and behold thy creatures thus
 ill used?
 </p><p>
 (Of Sheep, Cows, Goats and the like.)
 </p><p>
 Endless multitudes of these will have their little children taken
 from them ripped open and flayed and most barbarously quartered.
 </p><p>
 (Of Nuts, and Olives, and Acorns, and Chesnuts, and such like.)
 </p><p>
 Many offspring shall be snatched by cruel thrashing from the very
 arms of their mothers, and flung on the ground, and crushed.
 </p><p>
 (Of Children bound in Bundles.)
 </p><p>
 O cities of the Sea! In you I see your citizens--both females and
 males--tightly bound, arms and legs, with strong withes by folks who
 will not understand your language. And you will only be able to
 assuage your sorrows and lost liberty by means of tearful complaints
 and sighing and lamentation among yourselves; for those who will
 bind you will not understand you, nor will you understand them.
 </p><p>
 (Of Cats that eat Rats.)
 </p><p>
 In you, O cities of Africa your children will be seen quartered in
 their own houses by most cruel and rapacious beasts of your own
 country.
 </p><p>
 (Of Asses that are beaten.)
 </p><p>
  <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">657</font></a>
  O Nature! Wherefore art thou so
 partial; being to some of thy children a tender and benign mother,
 and to others a most cruel and pitiless stepmother? I see children
 of thine given up to slavery to others, without any sort of
 advantage, and instead of remuneration for the good they do, they
 are paid with the severest suffering, and spend their whole life in
 benefitting those who ill treat them.
 </p><p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 (Of Men who sleep on boards of Trees.)
 </p><p>
 Men shall sleep, and eat, and dwell among trees, in the forests and
 open country.
 </p><p>
 (Of Dreaming.)
 </p><p>
 Men will seem to see new destructions in the sky. The flames that
 fall from it will seem to rise in it and to fly from it with terror.
 They will hear every kind of animals speak in human language. They
 will instantaneously run in person in various parts of the world,
 without motion. They will see the greatest splendour in the midst of
 darkness. O! marvel of the human race! What madness has led you
 thus! You will speak with animals of every species and they with you
 in human speech. You will see yourself fall from great heights
 without any harm and torrents will accompany you, and will mingle
 with their rapid course.
 </p><p>
 (Of Christians.)
 </p><p>
 Many who hold the faith of the Son only build temples in the name of
 the Mother.
 </p><p>
 (Of Food which has been alive.)
 </p><p>
 [84] <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">658</font></a>
  A great portion
 of bodies that have been alive will pass into
 the bodies of other animals; which is as much as to say, that the
 deserted tenements will pass piecemeal into the inhabited ones,
 furnishing them with good things, and carrying with them their
 evils. That is to say the life of man is formed from things eaten,
 and these carry with them that part of man which dies . . .
