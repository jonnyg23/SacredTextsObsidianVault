 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF CRACKS IN WALLS, WHICH ARE WIDE AT THE BOTTOM AND NARROW AT THE TOP AND OF THEIR CAUSES.</h3>
 <p>
 That wall which does not dry uniformly in an equal time, always
 cracks.
 </p><p>
 A wall though of equal thickness will not dry with equal quickness
 if it is not everywhere in contact with the same medium. Thus, if
 one side of a wall were in contact with a damp slope and the other
 were in contact with the air, then this latter side would remain of
 the same size as before; that side which dries in the air will
 shrink or diminish and the side which is kept damp will not dry. And
 the dry portion will break away readily from the damp portion
 because the damp part not shrinking in the same proportion does not
 cohere and follow the movement of the part which dries continuously.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF ARCHED CRACKS, WIDE AT THE TOP, AND NARROW BELOW.</h3>
 <p>
 Arched cracks, wide at the top and narrow below are found in
 walled-up doors, which shrink more in their height than in their
 breadth, and in proportion as their height is greater than their
 width, and as the joints of the mortar are more numerous in the
 height than in the width.
 </p><p>
 The crack diminishes less in <i>r o</i> than in <i>m n</i>, in proportion as
 there is less material between <i>r</i> and <i>o</i> than between <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>.
 </p><p>
 Any crack made in a concave wall is wide below and narrow at the
 top; and this originates, as is here shown at <i>b c d</i>, in the side
 figure.
 </p><p>
 1. That which gets wet increases in proportion to the moisture it
 imbibes.
 </p><p>
 2. And a wet object shrinks, while drying, in proportion to the
 amount of moisture which evaporates from it.
