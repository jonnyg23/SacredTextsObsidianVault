 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The effects of morning light (444-448).</font></span>When the sun is in the east the trees to the South and to the North
 have almost as much light as shadow. But a greater share of light in
 proportion as they lie to the West and a greater share of shadow in
 proportion as they lie to the East.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF MEADOWS.</h3>
 <p>
 If the sun is in the East the verdure of the meadows and of other
 small plants is of a most beautiful green from being transparent to
 the sun; this does not occur in the meadows to the West, and in
 those to the South and North the grass is of a moderately brilliant
 green.
