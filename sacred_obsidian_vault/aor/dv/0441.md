 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The distribution of light and shade with reference to the position of the spectator (441-443).</font></span>The shadows of trees placed in a landscape do not display themselves
 in the same position in the trees on the right hand and those on the
 left; still more so if the sun is to the right or left. As is proved
 by the 4th which says: Opaque bodies placed between the light and
 the eye display themselves entirely in shadow; and by the 5th: The
 eye when placed between the opaque body and the light sees the
 opaque body entirely illuminated. And by the 6th: When the eye and
 the opaque body are placed between darkness and light, it will be
 seen half in shadow and half in light.
