 Again if the lowest part of the bank which lies across the current
 of the waters is made in deep and wide steps, after the manner of
 stairs, the waters which, in their course usually fall
 perpendicularly from the top of such a place to the bottom, and wear
 away the foundations of this bank can no longer descend with a blow
 of too great a force; and I find the example of this in the stairs
 down which the water falls in the fields at Sforzesca at Vigevano
 over which the running water falls for a height of 50 braccia.
