 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of depicting night scenes.</font></span>That which is entirely bereft of light is all darkness; given a
 night under these conditions and that you want to represent a night
 scene,--arrange that there shall be a great fire, then the objects
 which are nearest to this fire will be most tinged with its colour;
 for those objects which are nearest to a coloured light participate
 most in its nature; as therefore you give the fire a red colour, you
 must make all the objects illuminated by it ruddy; while those which
 are farther from the fire are more tinted by the black hue of night.
 The figures which are seen against the fire look dark in the glare
 of the firelight because that side of the objects which you see is
 tinged by the darkness of the night and not by the fire; and those
 who stand at the side are half dark and half red; while those who
 are visible beyond the edges of the flame will be fully lighted by
 the ruddy glow against a black background. As to their gestures,
 make those which are near it screen themselves with their hands and
 cloaks as a

 <p>defence against the intense heat, and with their faces
 turned away as if about to retire. Of those farther off represent
 several as raising their hands to screen their eyes, hurt by the
 intolerable glare.
