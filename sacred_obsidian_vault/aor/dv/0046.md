 <p>
 The point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies
 no space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the
 beginning of another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called
 nothing. 1. That which has no limitations, has no form. The
 limitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the
 surface of each. All the surfaces of a body are not parts of that
 body.
