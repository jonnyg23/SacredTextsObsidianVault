 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The Danube.</font></span>That the valleys were formerly in great part covered by lakes the
 soil of which always forms the banks of rivers,--and by seas, which
 afterwards, by the persistent wearing of the rivers, cut through the
 mountains and the wandering courses of the rivers carried away the
 other plains enclosed by the mountains; and the cutting away of the
 mountains is evident from the strata in the rocks, which correspond
 in their sections as made by the courses of the rivers  <a name="fr_264"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">598</font></a>
 , The Haemus mountains
 which go along Thrace and Dardania and join the Sardonius mountains
 which, going on to the westward change their name from Sardus to
 Rebi, as they come near Dalmatia; then turning to the West cross
 Illyria, now called Sclavonia, changing the name of Rebi to Albanus,
 and going on still to the West, they change to Mount Ocra in the
 North; and to the South above Istria they are named Caruancas; and
 to the West above Italy they join the Adula, where the Danube rises
 [8], which stretches to the East and has a
 </p><p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a></p>
 <p>course of 1500 miles; its
 shortest line is about l000 miles, and the same or about the same is
 that branch of the Adula mountains changed as to their name, as
 before mentioned. To the North are the Carpathians, closing in the
 breadth of the valley of the Danube, which, as I have said extends
 eastward, a length of about 1000 miles, and is sometimes 200 and in
 some places 300 miles wide; and in the midst flows the Danube, the
 principal river of Europe as to size. The said Danube runs through
 the middle of Austria and Albania and northwards through Bavaria,
 Poland, Hungary, Wallachia and Bosnia and then the Danube or Donau
 flows into the Black Sea, which formerly extended almost to Austria
 and occupied the plains through which the Danube now courses; and
 the evidence of this is in the oysters and cockle shells and
 scollops and bones of great fishes which are still to be found in
 many places on the sides of those mountains; and this sea was formed
 by the filling up of the spurs of the Adula mountains which then
 extended to the East joining the spurs of the Taurus which extend to
 the West. And near Bithynia the waters of this Black Sea poured into
 the Propontis [Marmora] falling into the Aegean Sea, that is the
 Mediterranean, where, after a long course, the spurs of the Adula
 mountains became separated from those of the Taurus. The Black Sea
 sank lower and laid bare the valley of the Danube with the above
 named countries, and the whole of Asia Minor beyond the Taurus range
 to the North, and the plains from mount Caucasus to the Black Sea to
 the West, and the plains of the Don this side--that is to say, at
 the foot of the Ural mountains. And thus the Black Sea must have
 sunk about 1000 braccia to uncover such vast plains.
