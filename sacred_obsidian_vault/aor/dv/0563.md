 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE BACKGROUND THAT THE PAINTER SHOULD ADOPT IN HIS WORKS.</h3>
 <p>
 Since experience shows us that all bodies are surrounded by light
 and shade it is necessary that you, O Painter, should so arrange
 that the side which is in light shall terminate against a dark body
 and likewise that the shadow side shall terminate against a light
 body. And by [following] this rule you will add greatly to the
 relief of your figures.
