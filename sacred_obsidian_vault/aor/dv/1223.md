 </p><h3 align="CENTER">GRATITUDE.</h3>
 <p>
 The virtue of gratitude is said to be more [developed] in the birds
 called hoopoes which, knowing the benefits of life and food, they
 have received from their father and their mother, when they see them
 grow old, make a nest for them and brood over them and feed them,
 and with their beaks pull out their old and shabby feathers; and
 then, with a certain herb restore their sight so that they return to
 a prosperous state.

 <p>
 The toad feeds on earth and always remains lean; because it never
 eats enough:-- it is so afraid lest it should want for earth.
