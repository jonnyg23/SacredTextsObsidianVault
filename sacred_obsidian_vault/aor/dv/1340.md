 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Drafts of Letters to Lodovico il Moro (1340-1345).</font></span>Most illustrious Lord, Having now sufficiently considered the
 specimens of all those who proclaim themselves skilled contrivers
 </p><p><a name="page_396"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 396</font></a></p>
 <p>of instruments of war, and that the invention and operation of the said
 instruments are nothing different to those in common use: I shall
 endeavour, without prejudice to any one else, to explain myself to
 your Excellency

 showing your Lordship my secrets, and then offering
 them to your best pleasure and approbation to work with effect at
 opportune moments as well as all those things which, in part, shall
 be briefly noted below.

 </p><p><a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 397</font></a></p>
 <p>1) I have a sort of extremely light and strong bridges, adapted to
 be most easily carried, and with them you may pursue, and at any
 time flee from the enemy; and others, secure and indestructible by
 fire and battle, easy and convenient to lift and place. Also methods
 of burning and destroying those of the enemy.
 </p><p>
 2) I know how, when a place is besieged, to take the water out of
 the trenches, and make endless variety of bridges, and covered ways
 and ladders, and other machines pertaining to such expeditions.
 </p><p>
 3) Item. If, by reason of the height of the banks, or the strength
 of the place and its position, it is impossible, when besieging a
 place, to avail oneself of the plan of bombardment, I have methods
 for destroying every rock or other fortress, even if it were founded
 on a rock, &amp;c
 </p><p>
 4) Again I have kinds of mortars; most convenient and easy to carry;
 and with these can fling small stones almost resembling a storm; and
 with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, to his
 great detriment and confusion.
 </p><p>
 9) [8] And when the fight should be at sea I have kinds of many
 machines most efficient for offence and defence; and vessels which
 will resist the attack of the largest guns and powder and fumes.
 </p><p>
 5) Item. I have means by secret and tortuous mines and ways, made
 without noise to reach a designated [spot], even if it were needed
 to pass under a trench or a river.
 </p><p>
 6) Item. I will make covered chariots, safe and unattackable which,
 entering among the enemy with their artillery, there is no body of
 men so great but they would break them. And behind these, infantry
 could follow quite unhurt and without any hindrance.
 </p><p>
 7) Item. In case of need I will make big guns, mortars and light
 ordnance of fine and useful forms, out of the common type.
 </p><p>
 8) Where the operation of bombardment should fail, I would contrive
 catapults, mangonels, <i>trabocchi</i> and other machines of marvellous
 efficacy and not in common use. And in short, according to the
 variety of cases, I can contrive various and endless means of
 offence and defence.
 </p><p><a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 398</font></a></p>
 <p>10) In time of peace I believe I can give perfect satisfaction and
 to the equal of any other in architecture and the composition of
 buildings public and private; and in guiding water from one place to
 another.
 </p><p>
 Item: I can carry out sculpture in marble, bronze or clay, and also
 in painting whatever may be done, and as well as any other, be he
 whom he may.
 </p><p>
 [32] Again, the bronze horse may be taken in hand, which is to be to
 the immortal glory and eternal honour of the prince your father of
 happy memory, and of the illustrious house of Sforza.
 </p><p>
 And if any one of the above-named things seem to any one to be
 impossible or not feasible, I am most ready to make the experiment
 in your park, or in whatever place may please your Excellency--to
 whom I commend myself with the utmost humility &amp;c

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_367"></a><a href="1340.htm#fr_367">396:673</a> : The numerous corrections, the alterations in the figures
 (l. 18) and the absence of any signature prove that this is merely
 the rough draft of a letter to Lodovico il Moro. It is one of the
 very few manuscripts which are written from left to right--see the
 facsimile of the beginning as here reproduced. This is probably the
 final sketch of a document the clean of which copy was written in
 the usual manner. Leonardo no doubt very rarely wrote so, and this
 is probably the reason of the conspicuous dissimilarity in the
 handwriting, when he did. (Compare <a href="dv20954.htm#img_pl038">Pl. XXXVIII</a>.) It is noteworthy
 too that here the orthography and abbreviations are also
 exceptional. But such superficial peculiarities are not enough to
 stamp the document as altogether spurious. It is neither a forgery
 nor the production of any artist but Leonardo himself. As to this
 point the contents leave us no doubt as to its authenticity,
 particularly l. 32 (see No. 719, where this passage is repeated).
 But whether the fragment, as we here see it, was written from
 Leonardo's dictation--a theory favoured by the orthography, the
 erasures and corrections--or whether it may be a copy made for or by
 Melzi or Mazenta is comparatively unimportant. There are in the
 Codex Atlanticus a few other documents not written by Leonardo
 himself, but the notes in his own hand found on the reverse pages of
 these leaves amply prove that they were certainly in Leonardo's
 possession. This mark of ownership is wanting to the text in
 question, but the compilers of the Codex Atlanticus, at any rate,
 accepted it as a genuine document.
