 <p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE PELICAN.</h3>
 <p>
 This bird has a great love for its young; and when it finds them in
 its nest dead from a serpent's bite, it pierces itself to the heart,
 and with its blood it bathes them till they return to life.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE SALAMANDER.</h3>
 <p>
 This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in
 which it constantly renews its scaly skin.
 </p><p>
 The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,--for
 virtue.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE CAMELEON.</h3>
 <p>
 This lives on air, and there it is the prey of all the birds; so in
 order to be safer it flies above the clouds and finds an air so
 rarefied that it cannot support the bird that follows it.
 </p><p>
 At that height nothing can go unless it has a gift from Heaven, and
 that is where the chameleon flies.
