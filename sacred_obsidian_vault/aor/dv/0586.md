 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The selection of forms.</font></span>A painter who has clumsy hands will paint similar hands in his
 works, and the same will occur with any limb, unless long study has
 taught him to avoid it. Therefore, O Painter, look carefully what
 part is most ill-favoured in your own person and take particular
 pains to correct it in your studies. For if you are coarse, your
 figures will seem the same and devoid of charm; and it is the same
 with any part that may be good or poor in yourself; it will be shown
 in some degree in your figures.
