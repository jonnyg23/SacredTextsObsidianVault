 <h3 align="CENTER"><i>The notes on Sculpture.</i></h3>
 <i>Compared with the mass of manuscript treating of Painting, a very
 small number of passages bearing on the practice and methods of
 Sculpture are to be found scattered through the note books; these
 are here given at the beginning of this section (Nos. 706-709).
 There is less cause for surprise at finding that the equestrian
 statue of Francesco Sforza is only incidentally spoken of; for,
 although Leonardo must have worked at it for a long succession of
 years, it is not in the nature of the case that it could have given
 rise to much writing. We may therefore regard it as particularly
 fortunate that no fewer than thirteen notes in the master's
 handwriting can be brought together, which seem to throw light on
 the mysterious history of this famous work. Until now writers on
 Leonardo were acquainted only with the passages numbered </i>712, 719,
 720, 722 <i>and</i> 723.
 <p>
 <i>In arranging these notes on sculpture I have given the precedence to
 those which treat of the casting of the monument, not merely because
 they are the fullest, but more especially with a view to
 reconstructing the monument, an achievement which really almost lies
 within our reach by combining and comparing the whole of the
 materials now brought to light, alike in notes and in sketches.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>A good deal of the first two passages, Nos. </i>710<i> and </i>711<i>, which refer
 to this subject seems obscure and incomprehensible; still, they
 supplement each other and one contributes in no small degree to the
 comprehension of the other. A very interesting and instructive
 commentary on these passages may be found in the fourth chapter of
 Vasari's</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>Introduzione della Scultura under the title </i>"Come si fanno
 i modelli per fare di bronzo le figure grandi e picciole, e come le
 forme per buttarle; come si armino di ferri, e come si gettino di
 metallo,"<i> &amp;c Among the drawings of models of the moulds for casting
 we find only one which seems to represent the horse in the act of
 galloping--No. 713. All the other designs show the horse as pacing
 quietly and as these studies of the horse are accompanied by copious
 notes as to the method of casting, the question as to the position
 of the horse in the model finally selected, seems to be decided by
 preponderating evidence. </i>"Il cavallo dello Sforza"<i>--C. Boito remarks
 very appositely in the Saggio on page 26, </i>"doveva sembrare fratello
 al cavallo del Colleoni. E si direbbe che questo fosse figlio del
 cavallo del Gattamelata, il quale pare figlio di uno dei quattro
 cavalli che stavano forse sull' Arco di Nerone in Roma"<i> (now at
 Venice). The publication of the Saggio also contains the
 reproduction of a drawing in red chalk, representing a horse walking
 to the left and supported by a scaffolding, given here on <a href="pl076.htm#img_pl076">Pl. LXXVI</a>,
 No. 1. It must remain uncertain whether this represents the model as
 it stood during the preparations for casting it, or whether--as
 seems to me highly improbable--this sketch shows the model as it was
 exhibited in </i>1493<i> on the Piazza del Castello in Milan under a
 triumphal arch, on the occasion of the marriage of the Emperor
 Maximilian to Bianca Maria Sforza. The only important point here is
 to prove that strong evidence seems to show that, of the numerous
 studies for the equestrian statue, only those which represent the
 horse pacing agree with the schemes of the final plans.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The second group of preparatory sketches, representing the horse as
 galloping, must therefore be considered separately, a distinction
 which, in recapitulating the history of the origin of the monument
 seems justified by the note given under No. </i>720.
 </p><p>
 <i>Galeazza Maria Sforza was assassinated in </i>1476<i> before his scheme for
 erecting a monument to his father Francesco Sforza could be carried
 into effect. In the following year Ludovico il Moro the young
 aspirant to the throne was exiled to Pisa, and only returned to
 Milan in </i>1479<i> when he was Lord (Governatore) of the State of Milan,
 in </i>1480<i> after the minister Cecco Simonetta had been murdered. It may
 have been soon after this that Ludovico il Moro announced a
 competition for an equestrian statue, and it is tolerably certain
 that Antonio del Pollajuolo took part in it, from this passage in
 Vasari's Life of this artist: </i>"E si trov&amp;ograve, dopo la morte sua, il
 disegno e modello che a Lodovico Sforza egli aveva fatto per la
 statua a cavallo di Francesco Sforza, duca di Milano; il quale
 disegno è nel nostro Libro, in due modi: in uno egli ha sotto
 Verona; nell'altro, egli tutto armato, e sopra un basamento pieno di
 battaglie, fa saltare il cavallo addosso a un armato; ma la cagione
 perche non mettesse questi disegni in opera, non ho gia potuto
 sapere."<i> One of Pollajuolo's drawings, as here described, has lately
 been discovered by Senatore Giovanni Morelli in the Munich
 Pinacothek. Here the profile of the horseman is a portrait of
 Francesco Duke of Milan, and under the horse, who is galloping to
 the left, we see a warrior thrown and lying on the ground; precisely
 the same idea as we find</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>
 <p><i>in some of Leonardo's designs for the
 monument, as on <a href="pl066.htm#img_pl066">Pl. LXVI</a>, <a href="pl067.htm#img_pl067">LXVII</a>, <a href="pl068.htm#img_pl068">LXVIII</a>, <a href="pl069.htm#img_pl069">LXIX</a> and <a href="pl072.htm#img_pl072">LXXII</a> No. </i>1<i>; and,
 as it is impossible to explain this remarkable coincidence by
 supposing that either artist borrowed it from the other, we can only
 conclude that in the terms of the competition the subject proposed
 was the Duke on a horse in full gallop, with a fallen foe under its
 hoofs.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Leonardo may have been in the competition there and then, but the
 means for executing the monument do not seem to have been at once
 forthcoming. It was not perhaps until some years later that Leonardo
 in a letter to the Duke (No. 719) reminded him of the project for
 the monument. Then, after he had obeyed a summons to Milan, the plan
 seems to have been so far modified, perhaps in consequence of a
 remonstrance on the part of the artist, that a pacing horse was
 substituted for one galloping, and it may have been at the same time
 that the colossal dimensions of the statue were first decided on.
 The designs given on <a href="pl070.htm#img_pl070">Pl. LXX</a>, <a href="pl071.htm#img_pl071">LXXI</a>, <a href="pl072.htm#img_pl072">LXXII</a>, 2 and 3, <a href="pl073.htm#img_pl073">LXXIII</a> and <a href="pl074.htm#img_pl074">LXXIV</a>
 and on pp. 4 and 24, as well as three sketches on <a href="pl069.htm#img_pl069">Pl. LXIX</a> may be
 studied with reference to the project in its new form, though it is
 hardly possible to believe that in either of these we see the design
 as it was actually carried out. It is probable that in Milan
 Leonardo worked less on drawings, than in making small models of wax
 and clay as preparatory to his larger model. Among the drawings
 enumerated above, one in black chalk, <a href="pl073.htm#img_pl073">Pl. LXXIII</a>--the upper sketch
 on the right hand side, reminds us strongly of the antique statue of
 Marcus Aurelius. If, as it would seem, Leonardo had not until then
 visited Rome, he might easily have known this statue from drawings
 by his former master and friend Verrocchio, for Verrocchio had been
 in Rome for a long time between </i>1470<i> and </i>1480<i>. In </i>1473<i> Pope Sixtus
 IV had this antique equestrian statue restored and placed on a new
 pedestal in front of the church of San Giovanni in Luterano.
 Leonardo, although he was painting independently as early as in </i>1472<i>
 is still spoken of as working in Verrocchio's studio in </i>1477<i>. Two
 years later the Venetian senate decided on erecting an equestrian
 statue to Colleoni; and as Verrocchio, to whom the work was
 entrusted, did not at once move from Florence to Venice--where he
 died in 1488 before the casting was completed--but on the contrary
 remained in Florence for some years, perhaps even till </i>1485<i>,
 Leonardo probably had the opportunity of seeing all his designs for
 the equestrian statue at Venice and the red chalk drawing on <a href="pl074.htm#img_pl074">Pl. LXXIV</a> may be a reminiscence of it.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The pen and ink drawing on <a href="pl072.htm#img_pl072">Pl. LXXII</a>, No. </i>3<i>, reminds us of
 Donatello's statue of Gattamelata at Padua. However it does not
 appear that Leonardo was ever at Padua before </i>1499<i>, but we may
 conclude that he took a special interest in this early bronze statue
 and the reports he could procure of it, form an incidental remark
 which is to be found in C. A. 145<sup>a</sup>; 432<sup>a</sup>, and which will be given in
 Vol. II under </i>Ricordi<i> or Memoranda.</i>

 It was beyond a doubt compiled by Leonardo when at Milan; only
 interesting records to be found among these designs are reproduced
 in Nos. 716a but it must be pointed out that out of 40 sheets of
 studies of the movements of the belonging to that treatise, a horse
 in full gallop occurs but once.</i>
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>If we may trust the account given by Paulus Jovius--about l527--
 Leonardo's horse was represented as "vehementer incitatus et
 anhelatus". Jovius had probably seen the model exhibited at Milan;
 but, need we, in fact, infer from this description that the horse
 was galloping? Compare Vasari's description of the Gattamelata
 monument at Padua:</i> "Egli [Donatello] vi ando ben volentieri, e fece
 il cavallo di bronzo, che e in sulla piazza di Sant Antonio, nel
 quale si dimostra lo sbuffamento ed il fremito del cavallo, ed il
 grande animo e la fierezza vivacissimamente espressa dall'arte nella
 figura che lo cavalca".
 </p><p>
 <i>These descriptions, it seems to me, would only serve to mark the
 difference between the work of the middle ages and that of the
 renaissance.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>We learn from a statement of Sabba da Castiglione that, when Milan
 was taken by the French in </i>1499<i>, the model sustained some injury;
 and this informant, who, however is not invariably trustworthy, adds
 that Leonardo had devoted fully sixteen years to this work (</i>la forma
 del cavallo, intorno a cui Leonardo avea sedici anni continui
 consumati<i>). This often-quoted passage has given ground for an
 assumption, which has no other evidence to support it, that Leonardo
 had lived in Milan ever since 1483. But I believe it is nearer the
 truth to suppose that this author's statement alludes to the fact
 that about sixteen years must have past since the competition in
 which Leonardo had taken part.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>I must in these remarks confine myself strictly to the task in hand
 and give no more of the history of the Sforza monument than is
 needed to explain the texts and drawings I have been able to
 reproduce. In the first place, with regard to the drawings, I may
 observe that they are all, with the following two exceptions, in the
 Queen's Library at Windsor Castle; the red chalk drawing on <a href="pl076.htm#img_pl076">Pl. LXXVI</a> No. </i>1<i> is in the MS. C. A. (see No. 7l2) and the fragmentary
 pen and ink drawing on page </i>4<i> is in the Ambrosian Library. The
 drawings from Windsor on <a href="pl066.htm#img_pl066">Pl. LXVI</a> have undergone a trifling
 reduction from the size of the originals.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>There can no longer be the slightest doubt that the well-known
 engraving of several horsemen (Passavant, Le Peintre-Graveur, Vol.
 V, p. </i>181<i>, No. </i>3<i>) is only a copy after original drawings by
 Leonardo, executed by some unknown engraver; we have only to compare
 the engraving with the facsimiles of drawings on <a href="dv20000.htm#img_pl065">Pl. LXV</a>, No. </i>2<i>, Pl. <a href="pl067.htm#img_pl067">LXVII</a>, <a href="pl068.htm#img_pl068">LXVIII</a> and <a href="pl069.htm#img_pl069">LXIX</a>
 which, it is quite evident, have served as
 models for the engraver.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>On <a href="dv20000.htm#img_pl065">Pl. LXV</a> No. </i>1<i>, in the larger sketch to the right hand, only the
 base is distinctly visible, the figure of the horseman is effaced.
 Leonardo evidently found it unsatisfactory and therefore rubbed it
 out.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The base of the monument--the pedestal for the equestrian statue--is
 repeatedly sketched on a magnificent plan. In the sketch just
 mentioned it has the character of a shrine or aedicula to contain a
 sarcophagus. Captives in chains are here represented on the
 entablature with their backs turned to that portion of the monument
 which more</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a></p>
 <p><i>strictly constitutes the pedestal of the horse. The lower portion of
 the aedicula is surrounded by columns. In the pen and ink drawing
 <a href="pl066.htm#img_pl066">Pl. LXVI</a>--the lower drawing on the right hand side--the sarcophagus
 is shown between the columns, and above the entablature is a plinth
 on which the horse stands. But this arrangement perhaps seemed to
 Leonardo to lack solidity, and in the little sketch on the left
 hand, below, the sarcophagus is shown as lying under an arched
 canopy. In this the trophies and the captive warriors are detached
 from the angles. In the first of these two sketches the place for
 the trophies is merely indicated by a few strokes; in the third
 sketch on the left the base is altogether broader, buttresses and
 pinnacles having been added so as to form three niches. The black
 chalk drawing on <a href="pl068.htm#img_pl068">Pl. LXVIII</a> shows a base in which the angles are
 formed by niches with pilasters. In the little sketch to the extreme
 left on <a href="dv20000.htm#img_pl065">Pl. LXV</a>, No. </i>1<i>, the equestrian statue serves to crown a
 circular temple somewhat resembling Bramante's tempietto of San
 Pietro in Montario at Rome, while the sketch above to the right
 displays an arrangement faintly reminding us of the tomb of the
 Scaligers in Verona. The base is thus constructed of two platforms
 or slabs, the upper one considerably smaller than the lower one
 which is supported on flying buttresses with pinnacles.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>On looking over the numerous studies in which the horse is not
 galloping but merely walking forward, we find only one drawing for
 the pedestal, and this, to accord with the altered character of the
 statue, is quieter and simpler in style (<a href="pl074.htm#img_pl074">Pl. LXXIV</a>). It rises almost
 vertically from the ground and is exactly as long as the pacing
 horse. The whole base is here arranged either as an independent
 baldaquin or else as a projecting canopy over a recess in which the
 figure of the deceased Duke is seen lying on his sarcophagus; in the
 latter case it was probably intended as a tomb inside a church.
 Here, too, it was intended to fill the angles with trophies or
 captive warriors. Probably only No. </i>724<i> in the text refers to the
 work for the base of the monument.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>If we compare the last mentioned sketch with the description of a
 plan for an equestrian monument to Gian Giacomo Trivulzio (No. </i>725<i>)
 it seems by no means impossible that this drawing is a preparatory
 study for the very monument concerning which the manuscript gives us
 detailed information. We have no historical record regarding this
 sketch nor do the archives in the Trivulzio Palace give us any
 information. The simple monument to the great general in San Nazaro
 Maggiore in Milan consists merely of a sarcophagus placed in recess
 high on the wall of an octagonal chapel. The figure of the warrior
 is lying on the sarcophagus, on which his name is inscribed; a piece
 of sculpture which is certainly not Leonardo's work. Gian Giacomo
 Trivulzio died at Chartres in </i>1518<i>, only five months before
 Leonardo, and it seems to me highly improbable that this should have
 been the date of this sketch; under these circumstances it would
 have been done under the auspices of Francis I, but the Italian
 general was certainly not in favour with the French monarch at the
 time. Gian Giacomo Trivulzio was a sworn foe to Ludovico il Moro,
 whom he strove for years to overthrow. On the 6<sup>th</sup> September </i>1499<i> he
 marched victorious into Milan at the head</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>
 <p><i>of a French army. In a
 short time, however, he was forced to quit Milan again when Ludovico
 il Moro bore down upon the city with a force of Swiss troops. On the
 15<sup>th</sup> of April following, after defeating Lodovico at Novara,
 Trivulzio once more entered Milan as a Conqueror, but his hopes of
 becoming </i>Governatore<i> of the place were soon wrecked by intrigue.
 This victory and triumph, historians tell us, were signalised by
 acts of vengeance against the dethroned Sforza, and it might have
 been particularly flattering to him that the casting and
 construction of the Sforza monument were suspended for the time.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>It must have been at this moment--as it seems to me--that he
 commissioned the artist to prepare designs for his own monument,
 which he probably intended should find a place in the Cathedral or
 in some other church. He, the husband of Margherita di Nicolino
 Colleoni, would have thought that he had a claim to the same
 distinction and public homage as his less illustrious connection had
 received at the hands of the Venetian republic. It was at this very
 time that Trivulzio had a medal struck with a bust portrait of
 himself and the following remarkable inscription on the reverse:</i>
 <b> DEO FAVENTE • 1499 • DICTVS • IO • IA • EXPVLIT • LVDOVICV • SF •</b>
 (Sfortiam) <b>DVC•</b> (ducem) <b>MLI</b> (Mediolani)•<b>NOIE</b>
 (nomine)<b>• REGIS • FRANCORVM • EODEM • ANN •</b>;(anno) <b>RED'T</b> (redit)<b>• LVS</b>
 (Ludovicus •<b>SVPERATVS ET CAPTVS • EST • AB • EO</b>. <i>In the Library of
 the Palazzo Trivulzio there is a MS. of Callimachus Siculus written
 at the end of the XVth or beginning of the XVIth century. At the
 beginning of this MS. there is an exquisite illuminated miniature of
 an equestrian statue with the name of the general on the base; it is
 however very doubtful whether this has any connection with
 Leonardo's design.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Nos. </i>731-740<i>, which treat of casting bronze, have probably a very
 indirect bearing on the arrangements made for casting the equestrian
 statue of Francesco Sforza. Some portions evidently relate to the
 casting of cannon. Still, in our researches about Leonardo's work on
 the monument, we may refer to them as giving us some clue to the
 process of bronze casting at that period.</i>
