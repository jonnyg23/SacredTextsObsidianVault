 <h3 align="CENTER">HOW THE FIVE SENSES ARE THE MINISTERS OF THE SOUL.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the relations of the soul to the organs of sense.</font></span>The soul seems to reside in the judgment, and the judgment would
 seem to be seated in that part where all the senses meet; and this
 is called the Common Sense and is not all-pervading throughout the
 body, as many have thought. Rather is it entirely in one part.
 Because, if it were all-pervading and the same in every part, there
 would have been no need to make the instruments of the senses meet
 in one centre and in one single spot; on the contrary it would have
 sufficed that the eye should fulfil the function of its sensation on
 its surface only, and not transmit the image of the things seen, to
 the sense, by means of the optic nerves, so that the soul--for the
 reason given above--may perceive it in the surface of the eye. In
 the same way as to the sense of hearing, it would have sufficed if
 the voice had merely
 </p><p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a></p>
 <p>sounded in the porous cavity of the indurated
 portion of the temporal bone which lies within the ear, without
 making any farther transit from this bone to the common sense, where
 the voice confers with and discourses to the common judgment. The
 sense of smell, again, is compelled by necessity to refer itself to
 that same judgment. Feeling passes through the perforated cords and
 is conveyed to this common sense. These cords diverge with infinite
 ramifications into the skin which encloses the members of the body
 and the viscera. The perforated cords convey volition and sensation
 to the subordinate limbs. These cords and the nerves direct the
 motions of the muscles and sinews, between which they are placed;
 these obey, and this obedience takes effect by reducing their
 thickness; for in swelling, their length is reduced, and the nerves
 shrink which are interwoven among the particles of the limbs; being
 extended to the tips of the fingers, they transmit to the sense the
 object which they touch.
 </p><p>
 The nerves with their muscles obey the tendons as soldiers obey the
 officers, and the tendons obey the Common [central] Sense as the
 officers obey the general. [27] Thus the joint of the bones obeys
 the nerve, and the nerve the muscle, and the muscle the tendon and
 the tendon the Common Sense. And the Common Sense is the seat of the
 soul [28], and memory is its ammunition, and the impressibility is
 its referendary since the sense waits on the soul and not the soul
 on the sense. And where the sense that ministers to the soul is not
 at the service of the soul, all the functions of that sense are also
 wanting in that man's life, as is seen in those born mute and blind.

 muscle cord or tendon and Common Sense may be understood from lines
