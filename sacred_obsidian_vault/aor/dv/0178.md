 It can be proved why the shadow <i>o p c h</i> is darker in proportion as
 it is nearer to the line <i>p h</i> and is lighter in proportion as it is
 nearer to the line <i>o c</i>. Let the light <i>a b</i>, be a window, and let
 the dark wall in which this window is, be <i>b s</i>, that is, one of the
 sides of the wall.
 </p><p>
 Then we may say that the line <i>p h</i> is darker than any other part of
 the space <i>o p c h</i>, because this line faces the whole surface in
 shadow of  <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">81</font></a>

 <p>the wall <i>b s</i>. The line <i>o c</i> is lighter than the
 other part of this space <i>o p c h</i>, because this line faces the
 luminous space <i>a b</i>.

 Where the shadow is larger, or smaller, or equal the body which
 casts it.

 The shadow <i>f r c h</i> is under such conditions as that where it is
 farthest from its inner side it loses depth in proportion. To prove
 this:
 </p><p>
 Let <i>d a</i>, be the light and <i>f n</i> the solid body, and let <i>a e</i> be
 one of the side walls of the window that is <i>d a</i>. Then I
 say--according to the 2nd [proposition]: that the surface of any
 body is affected by the tone of the objects surrounding it,--that
 the side <i>r c</i>, which faces the dark wall <i>a e</i> must participate of
 its darkness and, in the same way that the outer surface which faces
 the light <i>d a</i> participates of the light; thus we get the outlines
 of the extremes on each side of the centre included between them.]
 </p><p>
 This is divided into four parts. The first the extremes, which
 include the compound shadow, secondly the compound shadow between
 these extremes.
