 To measure how many times the diameter of the sun will go into its
 course in 24 hours.

 Make a circle and place it to face the south, after the manner of a
 sundial, and place a rod in the middle in such a way as that its
 length points to the centre of this circle, and mark the shadow cast
 in the sunshine by this rod on the circumference of the circle, and
 this shadow will be--let us say-- as broad as from <i>a</i> to <i>n</i>. Now
 measure how many times this shadow will go into this circumference
 of a circle, and that will give you the number of times that the
 solar body will go into its orbit in 24 hours. Thus you may see
 whether Epicurus was [right in] saying that the sun was only as
 large as it looked; for, as the apparent diameter of the sun is
 about a foot, and as that sun would go a thousand times into the
 length of its course in 24 hours, it would have gone a thousand
 feet, that is 300 braccia, which is the sixth of a mile. Whence it
 would follow that the course of the sun during the day would be the
 sixth part of a mile and that this venerable snail, the sun will
 have travelled 25 braccia an hour.
