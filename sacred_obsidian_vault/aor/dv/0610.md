 <p>within--by the falling of the hills which served
 as roofs to these caverns.

 A stone flung through the air leaves on the eye which sees it the
 impression of its motion, and the same effect is produced by the
 drops of water which fall from the clouds when it [16] rains.
 </p><p>
 [17] A mountain falling on a town, will fling up dust in the form of
 clouds; but the colour of this dust will differ from that of the
 clouds. Where the rain is thickest let the colour of the dust be
 less conspicuous and where the dust is thickest let the rain be less
 conspicuous. And where the rain is mingled with the wind and with
 the dust the clouds created by the rain must be more transparent
 than those of dust [alone]. And when flames of fire are mingled with
 clouds of smoke and water very opaque and dark clouds will be formed

 . And the
 rest of this subject will be treated in detail in the book on
 painting.

 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="0610.htm#fr_289">313:287</a>  26-28: Compare <a href="pl040.htm#img_pl040">Pl. XL</a>, 1--the drawing in Indian ink on the
 left hand side, which seems to be a reminiscence of his observations
 of an eruption (see his remarks on Mount Etna in Vol II).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_290"></a><a href="0610.htm#fr_290">313:288</a> : See the sketches and text on <a href="pl038.htm#img_pl038">Pl. XXXVIII</a>, No. 1. Lines
 1-16 are there given on the left hand side, 17-30 on the right. The
 four lines at the bottom on the right are given as No. 472. Above
 these texts, which are written backwards, there are in the original
 sixteen lines in a larger writing from left to right, but only half
 of this is here visible. They treat of the physical laws of motion
 of air and water. It does not seem to me that there is any reason
 for concluding that this writing from left to right is spurious.
 Compare with it the facsimile of the rough copy of Leonardo's letter
 to Ludovico il Moro in Vol. II.</p>
