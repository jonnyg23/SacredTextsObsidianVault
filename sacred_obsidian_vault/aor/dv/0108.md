 Here follows what is wanting in the margin at the foot on the other
 side of this page.

 Natural perspective acts in a contrary way; for, at greater
 distances the object seen appears smaller, and at a smaller distance
 the object appears larger. But this said invention requires the
 spectator to stand with his eye at a

 <p>small hole and then, at that
 small hole, it will be very plain. But since many (men's) eyes
 endeavour at the same time to see one and the same picture produced
 by this artifice only one can see clearly the effect of this
 perspective and all the others will see confusion. It is well
 therefore to avoid such complex perspective and hold to simple
 perspective which does not regard planes as foreshortened, but as
 much as possible in their proper form. This simple perspective, in
 which the plane intersects the pyramids by which the images are
 conveyed to the eye at an equal distance from the eye is our
 constant experience, from the curved form of the pupil of the eye on
 which the pyramids are intersected at an equal distance from the
 visual virtue.
