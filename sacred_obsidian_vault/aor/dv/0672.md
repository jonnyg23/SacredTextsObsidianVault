 Il Moro as representing Good Fortune, with hair, and robes, and his
 hands in front, and Messer Gualtieri taking him by the robes with a
 respectful air from below, having come in from the front [5].
 </p><p>
 Again, Poverty in a hideous form running behind a youth. Il Moro
 covers him with the skirt of his robe, and with his gilt sceptre he
 threatens the monster.
 </p><p>
 A plant with its roots in the air to represent one who is at his
 last;--a robe and Favour.
 </p><p>
 Of tricks [<i>or</i> of magpies] and of burlesque poems [<i>or</i> of
 starlings].

 crowd, these shall all die cruel deaths; and fathers and mothers
 together with their families will be devoured and killed by cruel
 creatures.

 <p><a name="fn_310"></a><a href="0672.htm#fr_310">350:308</a> : 1--10 have already been published by <i>Amoretti</i> in
 <i>Memorie Storiche</i> cap. XII. He adds this note with regard to
 Gualtieri: "<i>A questo M. Gualtieri come ad uomo generoso e benefico
 scrive il Bellincioni un Sonetto (pag, 174) per chiedergli un
 piacere; e 'l Tantio rendendo ragione a Lodovico il Moro, perche
 pubblicasse le Rime del Bellincioni; ciò hammi imposto, gli dice:
 l'humano fidele, prudente e sollicito executore delli tuoi
 comandamenti Gualtero, che fa in tutte le cose ove tu possi far
 utile, ogni studio vi metti.</i>" A somewhat mysterious and evidently
 allegorical composition--a pen and ink drawing--at Windsor, see PL
 LVIII, contains a group of figures in which perhaps the idea is
 worked out which is spoken of in the text, lines 1-5.</p>
