 Why the planets appear larger in the East than they do overhead,
 whereas the contrary should be the case, as they are 3500 miles
 nearer to us when in mid sky than when on the horizon.

 All the degrees of the elements, through which the images of the
 celestial bodies pass to reach the eye, are equal curves and the
 angles by which the central line of those images passes through
 them, are unequal angles  <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">489</font></a>
 ; and the
 distance is greater, as is shown by the excess of <i>a b</i> beyond <i>a
 d</i>; and the enlargement of these celestial bodies on the horizon is
 shown by the 9th of the 7th.
