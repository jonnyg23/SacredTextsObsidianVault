 If two similar and equal objects are placed one beyond the other at
 a given distance the difference in their size will appear greater in
 proportion as they are

 nearer to the eye that sees them. And
 conversely there will seem to be less difference in their size in
 proportion as they are remote from the eve.
 <p>
 This is proved by the proportions of their distances among
 themselves; for, if the first of these two objects were as far from
 the eye, as the 2nd from the first this would be called the second
 proportion: since, if the first is at 1 braccia from the eye and the
 2nd at two braccia, two being twice as much as one, the first object
 will look twice as large as the second. But if you place the first
 at a hundred braccia from you and the second at a hundred and one,
 you will find that the first is only so much larger than the second
 as 100 is less than 101; and the converse is equally true. And
 again, the same thing is proved by the 4th of this book which shows
 that among objects that are equal, there is the same proportion in
 the diminution of the size as in the increase in the distance from
 the eye of the spectator.
