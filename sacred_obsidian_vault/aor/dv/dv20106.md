 </p><h3 align="CENTER"><i>Remarks on the style of Leonardo's architecture.</i></h3>
 <p>
 A few remarks may here be added on the style of Leonardo's
 architectural studies. However incomplete, however small in scale,
 they allow us to establish a certain number of facts and
 probabilities, well worthy of consideration.
 </p><p>
 When Leonardo began his studies the great name of Brunellesco was
 still the inspiration of all Florence, and we cannot doubt that
 Leonardo was open to it, since we find among his sketches the plan
 of the church of Santo Spirito <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">408</font></a>
 <i> and a lateral view of San
 Lorenzo (<a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</a> No. 1), a plan almost identical with the chapel
 Degli Angeli, only begun by him (<a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</a>, No. 3) while among
 Leonardo's designs for domes several clearly betray the influence of
 Brunellesco's Cupola and the lantern of Santa Maria del
 Fiore</i> <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">409</font></a>
 
 </p><p>
 <i>The beginning of the second period of modern Italian architecture
 falls during the first twenty years of Leonardo's life. However the
 new impetus given by Leon Battista Alberti either was not generally
 understood by his contemporaries, or those who appreciated it, had
 no opportunity of showing that they did so. It was only when taken
 up by Bramante and developed by him to the highest rank of modern
 architecture that this new influence was generally felt. Now the
 peculiar feature of Leonardo's sketches is that, like the works of
 Bramante, they appear to be the development and continuation of
 Alberti's.</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>But a question here occurs which is difficult to answer. Did
 Leonardo, till he quitted Florence, follow the direction given by
 the dominant school of Brunellesco, which would then have given rise
 to his "First manner", or had he, even before he left Florence, felt
 Alberti's influence--either through his works (Palazzo Ruccellai,
 and the front of Santa Maria Novella) or through personal
 intercourse? Or was it not till he went to Milan that Alberti's work
 began to impress him through Bramante, who probably had known
 Alberti at Mantua about 1470 and who not only carried out Alberti's
 views and ideas, but, by his designs for St. Peter's at Rome, proved
 himself the greatest of modern architects. When Leonardo went to
 Milan Bramante had already been living there for many years. One of
 his earliest works in Milan was the church of Santa Maria presso San
 Satiro, Via del Falcone</i> <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">410</font></a>
 .
 </p><p>
 <i>Now we find among Leonardos studies of Cupolas on Plates <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">LXXXIV</a> and
 <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">LXXXV</a> and in <a href="pl080.htm#img_pl080">Pl. LXXX</a> several sketches which seem to me to have been
 suggested by Bramante's dome of this church.
 </i></p><p>
 The MSS. B and Ash. II contain the plans of S. Sepolcro, the
 pavilion in the garden of the duke of Milan, and two churches,
 evidently inspired by the church of San Lorenzo at Milan.
 </p><p>
 MS. B. contains besides two notes relating to Pavia, one of them a
 design for the sacristy of the Cathedral at Pavia, which cannot be
 supposed to be dated later than 1492, and it has probably some
 relation to Leonardo's call to Pavia June 21, 1490 <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">411</font></a>
 . <i>These and other considerations justify us in
 concluding, that Leonardo made his studies of cupolas at Milan,
 probably between the years 1487 and 1492 in anticipation of the
 erection of one of the grandest churches of Italy, the Cathedral of
 Pavia. This may explain the decidedly Lombardo-Bramantesque tendency
 in the style of these studies, among which only a few remind us of
 the forms of the cupolas of S. Maria del Fiore and of the Baptistery
 of Florence. Thus, although when compared with Bramante's work,
 several of these sketches plainly reveal that master's influence, we
 find, among the sketches of domes, some, which show already
 Bramante's classic style, of which the Tempietto of San Pietro in
 Montorio, his first building executed at Rome, is the foremost
 example</i> <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">412</font></a>
 .
 </p><p>
 <i>On Plate <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">LXXXIV</a> is a sketch of the plan of a similar circular
 building; and the Mausoleum on <a href="pl098.htm#img_pl098">Pl. XCVIII</a>, no less than one of the
 pedestals for the statue of Francesco Sforza (<a href="dv20000.htm#img_pl065">Pl. LXV</a>), is of the
 same type.</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>The drawings <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a> No. 2, <a href="pl086.htm#img_pl086">Pl. LXXXVI</a> No. 1 and 2 and the ground
 <a href="errata.htm#0">floor</a> of the building in the
 drawing <a href="pl091.htm#img_pl091">Pl. XCI</a> No. 2, with the interesting decoration by gigantic
 statues in large niches, are also, I believe, more in the style
 Bramante adopted at Rome, than in the Lombard style. Are we to
 conclude from this that Leonardo on his part influenced Bramante in
 the sense of simplifying his style and rendering it more congenial
 to antique art? The answer to this important question seems at first
 difficult to give, for we are here in presence of Bramante, the
 greatest of modern architects, and with Leonardo, the man comparable
 with no other. We have no knowledge of any buildings erected by
 Leonardo, and unless we admit personal intercourse--which seems
 probable, but of which there is no proof--, it would be difficult to
 understand how Leonardo could have affected Bramante's style. The
 converse is more easily to be admitted, since Bramante, as we have
 proved elsewhere, drew and built simultaneously in different
 manners, and though in Lombardy there is no building by him in his
 classic style, the use of brick for building, in that part of Italy,
 may easily account for it.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Bramante's name is incidentally mentioned in Leonardo's manuscripts
 in two passages (Nos. 1414 and 1448). On each occasion it is only a
 slight passing allusion, and the nature of the context gives us no
 due information as to any close connection between the two artists.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>It might be supposed, on the ground of Leonardo's relations with
 the East given in sections XVII and XXI of this volume, that some
 evidence of oriental influence might be detected in his
 architectural drawings. I do not however think that any such traces
 can be pointed out with certainty unless perhaps the drawing for a
 Mausoleum, <a href="pl090.htm#img_pl090">Pl. XC</a> VIII.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Among several studies for the construction of cupolas above a Greek
 cross there are some in which the forms are decidedly monotonous.
 These, it is clear, were not designed as models of taste; they must
 be regarded as the results of certain investigations into the laws
 of proportion, harmony and contrast.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The designs for churches, on the plan of a Latin cross are
 evidently intended to depart as little as possible from the form of
 a Greek cross; and they also show a preference for a nave surrounded
 with outer porticos.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The architectural forms preferred by Leonardo are pilasters coupled
 (<a href="pl082.htm#img_pl082">Pl. LXXXII</a> No. 1; or grouped (<a href="pl080.htm#img_pl080">Pl. LXXX</a> No. 5 and <a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">XCIV</a> No. 4), often
 combined with niches. We often meet with orders superposed, one in
 each story, or two small orders on one story, in combination with
 one great order (<a href="pl096.htm#img_pl096">Pl. XCVI</a> No. 2).</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>The drum (tamburo) of these cupolas is generally octagonal, as in
 the cathedral of Florence, and with similar round windows in its
 sides. In <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 2 it is circular like the model actually
 carried out by Michael Angelo at St. Peter's.
 </i></p><p>
 The cupola itself is either hidden under a pyramidal roof, as in the
 Baptistery of Florence, San Lorenzo of Milan and most of the Lombard
 churches (<a href="pl091.htm#img_pl091">Pl. XCI</a> No. 1 and <a href="pl092.htm#img_pl092">Pl. XCII</a> No. 1); but it more generally
 suggests the curve of Sta Maria del Fiore (<a href="pl088.htm#img_pl088">Pl. LXXXVIII</a> No. 5; <a href="pl090.htm#img_pl090">Pl. XC</a> No. 2; <a href="pl089.htm#img_pl089">Pl. LXXXIX</a>, M; <a href="pl090.htm#img_pl090">Pl. XC</a> No. 4, <a href="pl096.htm#img_pl096">Pl. XCVI</a> No. 2). In other
 cases (<a href="pl080.htm#img_pl080">Pl. LXXX</a> No. 4; <a href="pl089.htm#img_pl089">Pl. LXXXIX</a>; <a href="pl090.htm#img_pl090">Pl. XC</a> No. 2) it shows the sides
 of the octagon crowned by semicircular pediments, as in
 Brunellesco's lantern of the Cathedral and in the model for the
 Cathedral of Pavia.
 </p><p>
 Finally, in some sketches the cupola is either semicircular, or as
 in <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 2, shows the beautiful line, adopted sixty years
 later by Michael Angelo for the existing dome of St. Peter's.
 </p><p>
 It is worth noticing that for all these domes Leonardo is not
 satisfied to decorate the exterior merely with ascending ribs or
 mouldings, but employs also a system of horizontal parallels to
 complete the architectural system. Not the least interesting are the
 designs for the tiburio (cupola) of the Milan Cathedral. They show
 some of the forms, just mentioned, adapted to the peculiar gothic
 style of that monument.
 </p><p>
 The few examples of interiors of churches recall the style employed
 in Lombardy by Bramante, for instance in S. Maria di Canepanuova at
 Pavia, or by Dolcebuono in the Monastero Maggiore at Milan (see <a href="pl101.htm#img_pl101">Pl. CI</a> No. 1 [C. A. 181b; 546b]; <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a> No. 10).
 </p><p>
 The few indications concerning palaces seem to prove that Leonardo
 followed Alberti's example of decorating the walls with pilasters
 and a flat rustica, either in stone or by graffitti (<a href="pl102.htm#img_pl102">Pl. CII</a> No. 1
 and <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a> No. 14).
 </p><p>
 By pointing out the analogies between Leonardo's architecture and
 that of other masters we in no way pretend to depreciate his
 individual and original inventive power. These are at all events
 beyond dispute. The project for the Mausoleum (<a href="pl098.htm#img_pl098">Pl. XCVIII</a>) would
 alone suffice to rank him among the greatest architects who ever
 lived. The peculiar shape of the tower (<a href="pl080.htm#img_pl080">Pl. LXXX</a>), of the churches
 for preaching (<a href="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</a> No. 1 and pages 56 and 57, Fig. 1-4), his
 curious plan for a city with high and low level streets (<a href="pl077.htm#img_pl077">Pl. LXXVII</a>
 and <a href="pl078.htm#img_pl078">LXXVIII</a> No. 2 and No. 3), his Loggia with fountains (<a href="pl082.htm#img_pl082">Pl. LXXXII</a>
 No. 4) reveal an originality, a power and facility of invention for
 almost any given problem, which are quite wonderful.
 </p><p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>In addition to all these qualities he propably stood alone in his
 day in one department of architectural study,--his investigations,
 namely, as to the resistance of vaults, foundations, walls and
 arches.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>As an application of these studies the plan of a semicircular vault
 (<a href="pl103.htm#img_pl103">Pl. CIII</a> No. 2) may be mentioned here, disposed so as to produce no
 thrust on the columns on which it rests:</i> volta i botte e non
 ispignie ifori le colone. <i>Above the geometrical patterns on the
 same sheet, close to a circle inscribed in a square is the note:</i> la
 ragio d'una volta cioe il terzo del diamitro della sua ... del
 tedesco in domo.
 </p><p>
 <i>There are few data by which to judge of Leonardo's style in the
 treatment of detail. On <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a> No. 10 and <a href="pl103.htm#img_pl103">Pl. CIII</a> No. 3, we find
 some details of pillars; on <a href="pl101.htm#img_pl101">Pl. CI</a> No. 3 slender pillars designed
 for a fountain and on <a href="pl103.htm#img_pl103">Pl. CIII</a> No. 1 MS. B, is a pen and ink drawing
 of a vase which also seems intended for a fountain. Three handles
 seem to have been intended to connect the upper parts with the base.
 There can be no doubt that Leonardo, like Bramante, but unlike
 Michael Angelo, brought infinite delicacy of motive and execution to
 bear on the details of his work.</i>
