 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE AGREEMENT OF THE PROPORTION OF THE LIMBS.</h3>
 <p>
 And again, remember to be very careful in giving your figures limbs,
 that they must appear to agree with the size of the body and
 likewise to the age. Thus a youth has limbs that are not very
 muscular not strongly veined, and the surface is delicate and round,
 and tender in colour. In man the limbs are sinewy and muscular,
 while in old men the surface is wrinkled, rugged and knotty, and the
 sinews very prominent.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW YOUNG BOYS HAVE THEIR JOINTS JUST THE REVERSE OF THOSE OF MEN,</h3>
 <h3 align="CENTER">AS TO SIZE.</h3>
 <p>
 Little children have all the joints slender and the portions between
 them are thick; and this happens because nothing but the skin covers
 the joints without any other flesh and has the character of sinew,
 connecting the bones like a ligature. And the fat fleshiness is laid
 on between one joint and the next, and between the skin and the
 bones. But, since the bones are thicker at the joints than between
 them, as a mass grows up the flesh ceases to have that superfluity
 which it had, between the skin and the bones; whence the skin clings
 more closely to the bone and the limbs grow more slender. But since
 there is nothing over the joints but the cartilaginous and sinewy
 skin this cannot dry up, and, not drying up, cannot shrink. Thus,
 and for this reason, children are slender at the joints and fat
 between the joints; as may be seen in the joints of the fingers,
 arms, and shoulders, which are slender and dimpled, while in man on
 the contrary all the joints of the fingers, arms, and legs are
 thick; and wherever children have hollows men have prominences.
