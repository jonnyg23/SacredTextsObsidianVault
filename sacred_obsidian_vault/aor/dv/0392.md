 You ought not to give to drapery a great confusion of many folds,
 but rather only introduce them where they are held by the hands or
 the arms; the rest you may let fall simply where it is its nature to
 flow; and do not let the nude forms be broken by too many details
 and interrupted folds. How draperies should be drawn from nature:
 that is to say if youwant to represent woollen cloth draw the folds
 from that; and if it is to be silk, or fine cloth or coarse, or of
 linen or of crape, vary the folds in each and do not represent
 dresses, as many do, from models covered with paper or thin leather
 which will deceive you greatly.

 given on <a href="pl028.htm#img_pl028">Pl. XXVIII</a>, No. 7, clearly illustrates the statement made
 at the beginning of this passage; the writing of the cipher 19 on
 the same page is in Leonardo's hand; the cipher 21 is certainly
 not.</p>
