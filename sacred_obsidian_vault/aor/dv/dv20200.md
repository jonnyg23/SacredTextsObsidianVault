 <i>Ever since the publication by Venturi in</i> 1797 <i>and Libri in</i> 1840
 <i>of some few passages of Leonardo's astronomical notes, scientific
 astronomers have frequently expressed the opinion, that they must
 have been based on very important discoveries, and that the great
 painter also deserved a conspicuous place in the history of this
 science. In the passages here printed, a connected view is given of
 his astronomical studies as they lie scattered through the
 manuscripts, which have come down to us. Unlike his other purely
 scientific labours, Leonardo devotes here a good deal of attention
 to the opinions of the ancients, though he does not follow the
 practice universal in his day of relying on them as authorities; he
 only quotes them, as we shall see, in order to refute their
 arguments. His researches throughout have the stamp of independent
 thought. There is nothing in these writings to lead us to suppose
 that they were merely an epitome of the general learning common to
 the astronomers of the period. As early as in the XIVth century
 there were chairs of astronomy in the universities of Padua and
 Bologna, but so late as during the entire XVIth century Astronomy
 and Astrology were still closely allied.</i>

 <i>It is impossible now to decide whether Leonardo, when living in
 Florence, became acquainted in his youth with the doctrines of Paolo
 Toscanelli the great astronomer and mathematician (died</i> 1482<i>), of
 whose influence and teaching but little is now known, beyond the
 fact that he advised and encouraged Columbus to carry out his
 project of sailing round the world. His name is nowhere mentioned by
 Leonardo, and from the dates of the manuscripts from which the texts
 on astronomy are taken, it seems highly probable that Leonardo
 devoted his attention to astronomical studies less in his youth than
 in his later years. It was evidently his purpose to treat of
 Astronomy in a connected form and in a separate work (see the
 beginning of Nos.</i> 866 <i>and</i> 892<i>; compare also No.</i> 1167<i>). It is
 quite in accordance with his general scientific thoroughness that he
 should propose to write a special treatise on Optics as an
 introduction to Astronomy (see Nos.</i> 867 <i>and</i> 877<i>). Some of the
 chapters belonging to this Section bear the title</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "Prospettiva" <i>(see Nos.</i> 869 <i>and</i> 870<i>), this being the term universally applied
 at the time to Optics as well as Perspective (see Vol. I, p.</i> 10,
 <i>note to No.</i> 13, <i>l.</i> 10<i>)</i>.
 </p><p>
 <i>At the beginning of the XVIth century the Ptolemaic theory of the
 universe was still universally accepted as the true one, and
 Leonardo conceives of the earth as fixed, with the moon and sun
 revolving round it, as they are represented in the diagram to No.</i>
 897. <i>He does not go into any theory of the motions of the planets;
 with regard to these and the fixed stars he only investigates the
 phenomena of their luminosity. The spherical form of the earth he
 takes for granted as an axiom from the first, and he anticipates
 Newton by pointing out the universality of Gravitation not merely in
 the earth, but even in the moon. Although his acute research into
 the nature of the moon's light and the spots on the moon did not
 bring to light many results of lasting importance beyond making it
 evident that they were a refutation of the errors of his
 contemporaries, they contain various explanations of facts which
 modern science need not modify in any essential point, and
 discoveries which history has hitherto assigned to a very much later
 date</i>.
 </p><p>
 <i>The ingenious theory by which he tries to explain the nature of
 what is known as earth shine, the reflection of the sun's rays by
 the earth towards the moon, saying that it is a peculiar refraction,
 originating in the innumerable curved surfaces of the waves of the
 sea may be regarded as absurd; but it must not be forgotten that he
 had no means of detecting the fundamental error on which he based
 it, namely: the assumption that the moon was at a relatively short
 distance from the earth. So long as the motion of the earth round
 the sun remained unknown, it was of course impossible to form any
 estimate of the moon's distance from the earth by a calculation of
 its parallax</i>.
 </p><p>
 <i>Before the discovery of the telescope accurate astronomical
 observations were only possible to a very limited extent. It would
 appear however from certain passages in the notes here printed for
 the first time, that Leonardo was in a position to study the spots
 in the moon more closely than he could have done with the unaided
 eye. So far as can be gathered from the mysterious language in which
 the description of his instrument is wrapped, he made use of
 magnifying glasses; these do not however seem to have been
 constructed like a telescope--telescopes were first made about</i>
 1600. <i>As LIBRI pointed out</i> (Histoire des Sciences mathematiques
 III, 101) <i>Fracastoro of Verona</i> (1473-1553) <i>succeeded in
 magnifying the moon's face by an arrangement of lenses (compare No.</i>
 910, <i>note), and this gives probability to Leonardo's invention at a
 not much earlier date.</i>
