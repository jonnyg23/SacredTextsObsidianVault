 <h3 align="CENTER">ON FISSURES IN WALLS.</h3>
 <p>
 First write the treatise on the causes of the giving way of walls
 and then, separately, treat of the remedies.
 </p><p>
 Parallel fissures constantly occur in buildings which are erected on
 a hill side, when the hill is composed of stratified rocks with an
 oblique stratification, because water and other moisture often
 penetrates these oblique seams carrying in greasy and slippery soil;
 and as the strata are not continuous down to the bottom of the
 valley, the rocks slide in the direction of the slope, and the
 motion does not cease till they have reached the bottom of the
 valley, carrying with them, as though in a boat, that portion of the
 building which is separated by them from the rest. The remedy for
 this is always to build thick piers under the wall which is
 slipping, with arches from one to another, and with a good scarp and
 let the piers have a firm foundation in the strata so that they may
 not break away from them.
 </p><p>
 In order to find the solid part of these strata, it is necessary to
 make a shaft at the foot of the wall of great depth through the
 strata; and in this shaft, on the side from which the hill slopes,
 smooth and flatten a

 <p>space one palm wide from the top to the bottom;
 and after some time this smooth portion made on the side of the
 shaft, will show plainly which part of the hill is moving.
