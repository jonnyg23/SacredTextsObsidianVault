 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Notes on pupils (1458-1468.)</font></span>Giacomo came to live with me on St.-Mary
 Magdalen's[1] day, 1490, aged 10 years. The
 second day I had two shirts cut out for him,
 a pair of hose, and a jerkin, and when I put
 aside some money to pay for these things
 he stole 4 <i>lire</i>
 the money out of the purse; and I could never
 make him confess, though I was quite certain
 of the fact.--Thief, liar, obstinate, glutton.
 </p><p>
 The day after, I went to sup with Giacomo
 Andrea, and the said Giacomo supped
 for two and did mischief for four; for he
 brake 3 cruets, spilled the wine, and after
 this came to sup where I....
 </p><p>
 Item: on the 7th day of September he
 stole a silver point of the value of 22 soldi
 from Marco  <a name="fr_481"></a><a href="#fn_481"><font size="1">787</font></a>
  who was living with me, 4 <i>lire</i>
 this being of silver; and he took it from his
 studio, and when the said Marco had searched
 for it a long while he found it hidden
 in the said Giacomo's box 4 <i>lire</i>.

 </p><p><a name="page_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a></p>
 <p>Item: on the 26th January following,
 I, being in the house of Messer Galeazzo
 da San Severino  <a name="fr_483"></a><a href="#fn_483"><font size="1">789</font></a>
 , was arranging the festival for his jousting,
 and certain footmen having undressed to try on some costumes of wild men for the said festival, Giacomo
 went to the purse of one of them which lay
 on the bed with other clothes, 2 <i>lire</i> 4 S,
 and took out such money as was in it.
 </p><p>
 Item: when I was in the same house,
 Maestro Agostino da Pavia gave to me a
 Turkish hide to have 2 <i>lire</i>.
 a pair of short boots made of it; this
 Giacomo stole it of me within a month and
 sold it to a cobbler for 20 soldi, with
 which money, by his own confession, he
 bought anise comfits.
 </p><p>
 Item: again, on the 2nd April, Giovan
 Antonio  <a name="fr_484"></a><a href="#fn_484"><font size="1">790</font></a>
  having left a silver point on a
 drawing of his, Giacomo stole it, and this
 was of the value of 24 soldi 1 <i>lira</i> 4 S.
 </p><p>

 <p><a name="fn_481"></a><a href="1458.htm#fr_481">438:787</a>  6: <i>Marco</i>, probably Leonardo's pupil Marco d'Oggionno;
 1470 is supposed to be the date of his
 birth and 1540 of his death.
 </p><p>
 <i>Che stava con meco.</i> We may infer from this that
 he left the master shortly after this, his term of
 study having perhaps expired.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_482"></a><a href="1458.htm#fr_482">438:788</a> : <i>Il di della Maddalena.</i> July 22.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_483"></a><a href="1458.htm#fr_483">439:789</a>  9: Galeazza. See No. 718 note.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_484"></a><a href="1458.htm#fr_484">439:790</a>  16: Giovan Antonio, probably Beltraffio, 1467 to 1516.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_485"></a><a href="1458.htm#fr_485">439:791</a> : Leonardo here gives a detailed account not only of the loss he and others incurred through Giacomo
 but of the wild tricks of the youth, and we may
 therefore assume that the note was not made merely
 as a record for his own use, but as a report to be
 forwarded to the lad's father or other responsible
 guardian.</p>
