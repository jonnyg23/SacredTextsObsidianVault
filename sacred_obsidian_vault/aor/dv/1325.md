 Flax is dedicated to death, and to the corruption of mortals. To
 death, by being used for snares and nets for birds, animals and
 fish; to corruption, by the flaxen sheets in which the dead are
 wrapped when they are buried, and who become corrupt in these
 winding sheets.-- And again, this flax does not separate its fibre
 till it has begun to steep and putrefy, and this is the flower with
 which garlands and decorations for funerals should be made.
