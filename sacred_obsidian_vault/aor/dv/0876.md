 It is impossible that the side of a spherical mirror, illuminated by
 the sun, should reflect its radiance unless this mirror were
 undulating or filled with bubbles.
 </p><p>
 You see here the sun which lights up the moon, a spherical mirror,
 and all of its surface, which faces the sun is rendered radiant.
 </p><p>
 Whence it may be concluded that what shines in the moon is water
 like that of our seas, and in waves as that is; and that portion
 which does not shine consists of islands and terra firma.

 This diagram, of several spherical bodies interposed between the eye
 and the sun, is given to show that, just as the reflection of the
 sun is seen in each of these bodies, in the same way that image may
 be seen in each curve of the waves of the sea; and as in these many
 spheres many reflections of the sun are seen, so in many waves there
 are many images, each of which at a great distance is much magnified
 to the eye. And, as this happens with each wave, the spaces

 <p>interposed between the waves are concealed; and, for this reason, it
 looks as though the many suns mirrored in the many waves were but
 one continuous sun; and the shadows, mixed up with the luminous
 images, render this radiance less brilliant than that of the sun
 mirrored in these waves.
