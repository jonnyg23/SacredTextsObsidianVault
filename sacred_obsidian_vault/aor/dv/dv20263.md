 Leonardo's researches as to the structure of the earth and sea were
 made at a time, when the extended voyages of the Spaniards and
 Portuguese had also excited a special interest in geographical
 questions in Italy, and particularly in Tuscany. Still, it need
 scarcely surprise us to find that in deeper questions, as to the
 structure of the globe, the primitive state of the earth's surface,
 and the like, he was far in advance of his time.
 </p><p>
 The number of passages which treat of such matters is relatively
 considerable; like almost all Leonardo's scientific notes they deal
 partly with theoretical and partly with practical questions. Some of
 his theoretical views of the motion of water were collected in a
 copied manuscript volume by an early transcriber, but without any
 acknowledgment of the source whence they were derived. This copy is
 now in the Library of the Barberini palace at Rome and was published
 under the title: "De moto e misura dell'acqua," by FRANCESCO
 CARDINALI, Bologna 1828. <i>In this work the texts are arranged under
 the following titles:</i> Libr. I. Della spera dell'acqua; Libr. II.
 Del moto dell'acqua; Libr. III. Dell'onda dell'acqua; Libr. IV. Dei
 retrosi d'acqua; Libr. V. Dell'acqua cadente; Libr. VI. Delle
 rotture fatte dall'acqua; Libr. VII Delle cose portate dall'acqua;
 Libr. VIII. Dell'oncia dell'acqua e delle canne; Libr. IX. De molini
 e d'altri ordigni d'acqua.

 <i>The large number of isolated observations scattered through the
 manuscripts, accounts for our so frequently finding notes of new
 schemes for the arrangement of those relating to water and its
 motions, particularly in the Codex Atlanticus: I have printed
 several of these plans as an introduction to the Physical Geography,
 and I have actually arranged the texts in accordance with the clue
 afforded by one of them which is undoubtedly one of the latest notes
 referring to the subject (No.</i> 920<i>). The text given as No.</i> 930
 <i>which is also taken from a late note-book of Leonardo's, served as
 a basis for the arrangement of the first of the seven books--or
 sections--, bearing the title: Of the Nature of Water</i> (Dell'acque
 in se).

 <i>As I have not made it any part of this undertaking to print the
 passages which refer to purely physical principles, it has also been
 necessary to exclude those practical researches which, in accordance
 with indications given in</i> 920, <i>ought to come in as Books</i> 13, 14
 <i>and</i> 15. <i>I can only incidentally mention here that Leonardo--as it
 seems to me, especially in his youth--devoted a great deal of
 attention to the construction of mills. This is proved by a number
 of drawings of very careful and minute execution, which are to be
 found in the Codex Atlanticus. Nor was it possible to include his
 considerations on the regulation of rivers, the making of canals and
 so forth (No.</i> 920, <i>Books</i> 10, 11 <i>and</i> 12<i>); but those passages in
 which the structure of a canal is directly connected with notices of
 particular places will be found duly inserted under section XVII
 (Topographical notes). In Vol. I, No.</i> 5 <i>the text refers to
 canal-making in general.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>On one point only can the collection of passages included under the
 general heading of Physical Geography claim to be complete. When
 comparing and sorting the materials for this work I took particular
 care not to exclude or omit any text in which a geographical name
 was mentioned even incidentally, since in all such researches the
 chief interest, as it appeared to me, attached to the question
 whether these acute observations on the various local
 characteristics of mountains, rivers or seas, had been made by
 Leonardo himself, and on the spot. It is self-evident that the few
 general and somewhat superficial observations on the Rhine and the
 Danube, on England and Flanders, must have been obtained from maps
 or from some informants, and in the case of Flanders Leonardo
 himself acknowledges this (see No.</i> 1008<i>). But that most of the
 other and more exact observations were made, on the spot, by
 Leonardo himself, may be safely assumed from their method and the
 style in which he writes of them; and we should bear it in mind that
 in all investigations, of whatever kind, experience is always spoken
 of as the only basis on which he relies. Incidentally, as in No.</i>
 984, <i>he thinks it necessary to allude to the total absence of all
 recorded observations.</i>
