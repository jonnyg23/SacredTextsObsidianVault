 And you, O Man, who will discern in this work of mine the wonderful
 works of Nature, if you think it would be a criminal thing to
 destroy it, reflect how much more criminal it is to take the life of
 a man; and if this, his external form, appears to thee marvellously
 constructed, remember that it is nothing as compared with the soul
 that dwells in that structure; for that indeed, be it what it may,
 is a thing divine. Leave it then to dwell in His work at His good
 will and pleasure, and let not your rage or malice destroy a
 life--for indeed, he who does not value it, does not himself deserve
