 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of time and its divisions (916-918).</font></span>Although time is included in the class of Continuous Quantities,
 being indivisible and immaterial, it does not come entirely under
 the head of Geometry, which represents its divisions by means of
 figures and bodies of infinite variety, such as are seen to be
 continuous in their visible and material properties. But only with
 its first principles does it agree, that is with the Point and the
 Line; the point may be compared to an instant of time, and the line
 may be likened to the length of a certain quantity of time, and just
 as a line begins and terminates in a point, so such a space of time.
 begins and terminates in an instant. And whereas a line is
 infinitely divisible, the divisibility of a space of time is of the
 same nature; and as the divisions of the line may bear a certain
 proportion to each other, so may the divisions of time.
