 <p>
 A dog, lying asleep on the fur of a sheep, one of his fleas,
 perceiving the odour of the greasy wool, judged that this must be a
 land of better living, and also more secure from the teeth and nails
 of the dog than where he fed on the dog; and without farther
 reflection he left the dog and went into the thick wool. There he
 began with great labour to try to pass among the roots of the hairs;
 but after much sweating had to give up the task as vain, because
 these hairs were so close that they almost touched each other, and
 there was no space where fleas could taste the skin. Hence, after
 much labour and fatigue, he began to wish to return to his dog, who
 however had already departed; so he was constrained after long
 repentance and bitter tears, to die of hunger.
