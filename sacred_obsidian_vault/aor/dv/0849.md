 The waters return with constant motion from the lowest depths of the
 sea to the utmost height of the mountains, not obeying the nature of
 heavier bodies; and in this they resemble the blood of animated
 beings which always moves from the sea of the heart and flows
 towards the top of the head; and here it may burst a vein, as may be
 seen when a vein bursts in the nose; all the blood rises from below
 to the level of the burst vein. When the water rushes out from the
 burst vein in the earth, it obeys the law of other bodies that are
 heavier than the air since it always seeks low places.

 merely a general suspicion of the circulation of the blood but a
 very clear conception of it. Leonardo's studies on the muscles of
 the heart are to be found in the MS. W. An. III. but no information
 about them has hitherto been made public. The limits of my plan in
 this work exclude all purely anatomical writings, therefore only a
 very brief excerpt from this note book can be given here. WILLIAM
 HARVEY (born 1578 and Professor of Anatomy at Cambridge from 1615)
 is always considered to have been the discoverer of the circulation
 of the blood. He studied medicine at Padua in 1598, and in 1628
 brought out his memorable and important work: <i>De motu cordis et
 sanguinis</i>.</p>
