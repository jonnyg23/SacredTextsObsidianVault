 </p><h3 align="CENTER">A CONFUTATION OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT SHELLS MAY HAVE BEEN CARRIED TO A DISTANCE OF MANY DAYS' JOURNEY FROM THE SEA BY THE DELUGE, WHICH WAS SO HIGH AS TO BE ABOVE THOSE HEIGHTS.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Further researches (989-991).</font></span>I say that the deluge could not carry objects, native to the sea, up
 to the mountains, unless the sea had already increased so as to
 create inundations as high up as those places; and this increase
 could not have occurred because it would cause a vacuum; and if you
 were to say that the air would rush in there, we have already
 concluded that what is heavy cannot remain above what is light,
 whence of necessity we must conclude that this deluge was caused by
 rain water, so that all these waters ran to the sea, and the sea did
 not run up the mountains; and as they ran to the sea, they thrust
 the shells from the shore of the sea and did not draw them to wards
 themselves. And if you were then to say that the sea, raised by the
 rain water, had carried these shells to such a height, we have
 already said that things heavier than water cannot rise upon it, but
 remain at the bottom of it, and do not move unless by the impact of
 the waves. And if you were to say that the waves had carried them to
 such high spots, we have proved that the waves in a great depth move
 in a contrary direction at the bottom to the motion at the top, and
 this is shown by the turbidity of the sea from the earth washed down
 near its shores. Anything which is lighter than the water moves with
 the waves, and is left on the highest level of the highest margin of
 the waves. Anything which is heavier than the water moves, suspended
 in it, between the surface and the bottom; and from these two
 conclusions, which will be amply proved in their place, we infer
 that the waves of the surface cannot convey shells, since they are
 heavier than water.

 If the deluge had to carry shells three hundred and four hundred
 miles from the sea, it would have carried them mixed with various
 other natural objects heaped together; and we see at such distances
 oysters all together, and sea-snails, and cuttlefish, and all the
 other shells which congregate together,
 </p><p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 215</font></a></p>
 <p>all to be found together and
 dead; and the solitary shells are found wide apart from each other,
 as we may see them on sea-shores every day. And if we find oysters
 of very large shells joined together and among them very many which
 still have the covering attached, indicating that they were left
 here by the sea, and still living when the strait of Gibraltar was
 cut through; there are to be seen, in the mountains of Parma and
 Piacenza, a multitude of shells and corals, full of holes, and still
 sticking to the rocks there. When I was making the great horse for
 Milan, a large sack full was brought to me in my workshop by certain
 peasants; these were found in that place and among them were many
 preserved in their first freshness.

 Under ground, and under the foundations of buildings, timbers are
 found of wrought beams and already black. Such were found in my time
 in those diggings at Castel Fiorentino. And these had been in that
 deep place before the sand carried by the Arno into the sea, then
 covering the plain, had heen raised to such a height; and before the
 plains of Casentino had been so much lowered, by the earth being
 constantly carried down from them.

 And if you were to say that these shells were created, and were
 continually being created in such places by the nature of the spot,
 and of the heavens which might have some influence there, such an
 opinion cannot exist in a brain of much reason; because here are the
 years of their growth, numbered on their shells, and there are large
 and small ones to be seen which could not have grown without food,
 and could not have fed without motion--and here they could not move
