 Describe landscapes with the wind, and the water, and the setting
 and rising of the sun.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE WIND.</h3>
 <p>
 All the leaves which hung towards the earth by the bending of the
 shoots with their branches, are turned up side down by the gusts of
 wind, and here their perspective is reversed; for, if the tree is
 between you and the quarter of the wind, the leaves which are
 towards you remain in their natural aspect, while those on the
 opposite side which ought to have their points in a contrary
 direction have, by being turned over, their points turned towards
 you.
