 <p>
 The gold-finch is a bird of which it is related that, when it is
 carried into the presence of a sick person, if the sick man is going
 to die, the bird turns away its head and never looks at him; but if
 the sick man is to be saved the bird never loses sight of him but is
 the cause of curing him of all his sickness.
 </p><p>
 Like unto this is the love of virtue. It never looks at any vile or
 base thing, but rather clings always to pure and virtuous things and
 takes up its abode in a noble heart; as the birds do in green woods
 on flowery branches. And this Love shows itself more in adversity
 than in prosperity; as light does, which shines most where the place
 is darkest.
