 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Of walking up and down (375-379)</font></span>When a man wants to stop running and check the impetus he is forced
 to hang back and take short quick steps.  <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">182</font></a>
  The centre of gravity of
 a man who lifts one of his feet from the ground always rests on the
 centre of the sole of the foot [he stands on].
 </p><p>
 A man, in going up stairs involuntarily throws so much weight
 forward and on the side of the upper foot as to be a counterpoise to
 the lower leg, so that the labour of this lower leg is limited to
 moving itself.
 </p><p>
 The first thing a man does in mounting steps is to relieve the leg
 he is about to lift of the weight of the body which was resting on
 that leg; and besides this, he gives to
 </p><p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>
 <p>the opposite leg all the
 rest of the bulk of the whole man, including [the weight of] the
 other leg; he then raises the other leg and sets the foot upon the
 step to which he wishes to raise himself. Having done this he
 restores to the upper foot all the weight of the body and of the leg
 itself, and places his hand on his thigh and throws his head forward
 and repeats the movement towards the point of the upper foot,
 quickly lifting the heel of the lower one; and with this impetus he
 lifts himself up and at the same time extends the arm which rested
 on his knee; and this extension of the arm carries up the body and
 the head, and so straightens the spine which was curved.
 </p><p>
 [32] The higher the step is which a man has to mount, the farther
 forward will he place his head in advance of his upper foot, so as
 to weigh more on <i>a</i> than on <i>b</i>; this man will not be on the step
 <i>m</i>. As is shown by the line <i>g f</i>.
