 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the moon's halo.</font></span>I have found, that the circles which at night seem to surround the
 moon, of various sizes, and degrees of density are caused by various
 gradations in the densities of the vapours which exist at different
 altitudes between the moon and our eyes. And of these halos the
 largest and least red is caused by the lowest of these vapours; the
 second, smaller one, is higher up, and looks redder because it is

 <p>seen through two vapours. And so on, as they are higher they will
 appear smaller and redder, because, between the eye and them, there
 is thicker vapour. Whence it is proved that where they are seen to
 be reddest, the vapours are most dense.
