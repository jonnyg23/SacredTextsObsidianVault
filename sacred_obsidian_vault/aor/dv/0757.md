 This building is inhabited below and above; the way up is by the
 campaniles, and in going up one has to use the platform, where the
 drums of the four domes are, and this platform has a parapet in
 front, and none of these domes communicate with the church, but they
 are quite separate.

 <i><a href="pl096.htm#img_pl096">Pl. XCVI</a> No. 1 (MS. C. A. 16b; 65a). Perspective view of a church
 seen from behind; this recalls the Duomo at Florence, but with two

 .

 <i><a href="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</a> No. 3 (MS. B. 52a). The central part is a development of
 S. Lorenzo at Milan, such as was executed at the Duomo of Pavia.
 There is sufficient analogy between the building actually executed
 and this sketch to suggest a direct connection between them.
 Leonardo accompanied Francesco di Giorgio</i> <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">380</font></a>
  <i>when the latter was consulted on June
 21st, 1490 as to this church; the fact that the only word
 accompanying the plan is:</i> "sagrestia", <i>seems to confirm our
 supposition, for the sacristies were added only in 1492, i. e. four
 years after the beginning of the Cathedral, which at that time was
 most likely still sufficiently unfinished to be capable of receiving
 the form of the present sketch.

 note: edifitio al proposito del fodameto figurato di socto

 Here we may also mention the plan of a Latin cross drawn in MS. C.
 A. fol. 266 (see p. 50).

 Florentine basilica San Lorenzo, seen from the North.

 <a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</a> No. 4 (V. A. V, 1). Principal front of a nave, most likely
 of a church on the plan of a Latin cross. We notice here not only

 <p><i>principal features which were employed afterwards in Alberti's
 front of S. Maria Novella, but even details of a more advanced
 style, such as we are accustomed to meet with only after the year 1520.

 In the background of Leonardo's unfinished picture of St. Jerome
 (Vatican Gallery) a somewhat similar church front is indicated (see
 the accompanying sketch).

 <i>The view of the front of a temple,
 apparently a dome in the centre of four corinthian porticos bearing
 pediments (published by Amoretti Tav. II. B as being by Leonardo),
 is taken from a drawing, now at the Ambrosian Gallery. We cannot
 consider this to be by the hand of the master.</i>
