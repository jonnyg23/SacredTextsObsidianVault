 <p>
 Now there is a certain race of painters who, having studied but
 little, must need take as their standard of beauty mere gold and
 azure, and these, with supreme conceit, declare that they will not
 give good work for miserable payment, and that they could do as well
 as any other if they were well paid. But, ye foolish folks! cannot
 such artists keep some good work, and then say: this is a costly
 work and this more moderate and this is average work and show that
 they can work at all prices?
