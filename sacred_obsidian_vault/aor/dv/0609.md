 </p><h3 align="CENTER">DESCRIPTION OF THE DELUGE.</h3>
 <p>
 Let there be first represented the summit of a rugged mountain with
 valleys surrounding its base, and on its sides let the surface of
 the soil be seen to slide, together with the small roots of the
 bushes, denuding great portions of the surrounding rocks. And
 descending ruinous from these precipices in its boisterous course,
 let it dash along and lay bare the twisted and gnarled roots of
 large trees overthrowing their roots upwards; and let the mountains,
 as they are scoured bare, discover the profound fissures made in
 them by ancient earthquakes. The base of the mountains may be in
 great part clothed and covered with ruins of shrubs, hurled down
 from the sides of their lofty peaks, which will be mixed with mud,
 roots, boughs of trees, with all sorts of leaves thrust in with the
 mud and earth and stones. And into the depth of some valley may have
 fallen the fragments of a mountain forming a shore to the swollen
 waters of its river; which, having already burst its banks, will
 rush on in monstrous waves; and the greatest will strike upon and
 destroy the walls of the cities and farmhouses in the valley [14].
 Then the ruins of the high buildings in these cities will throw up a
 great dust, rising up in
 </p><p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a></p>
 <p>shape like smoke or wreathed clouds against
 the falling rain; But the swollen waters will sweep round the pool
 which contains them striking in eddying whirlpools against the
 different obstacles, and leaping into the air in muddy foam; then,
 falling back, the beaten water will again be dashed into the air.
 And the whirling waves which fly from the place of concussion, and
 whose impetus moves them across other eddies going in a contrary
 direction, after their recoil will be tossed up into the air but
 without dashing off from the surface. Where the water issues from
 the pool the spent waves will be seen spreading out towards the
 outlet; and there falling or pouring through the air and gaining
 weight and impetus they will strike on the water below piercing it
 and rushing furiously to reach its depth; from which being thrown
 back it returns to the surface of the lake, carrying up the air that
 was submerged with it; and this remains at the outlet in foam
 mingled with logs of wood and other matters lighter than water.
 Round these again are formed the beginnings of waves which increase
 the more in circumference as they acquire more movement; and this
 movement rises less high in proportion as they acquire a broader
 base and thus they are less conspicuous as they die away. But if
 these waves rebound from various objects they then return in direct
 opposition to the others following them, observing the same law of
 increase in their curve as they have already acquired in the
 movement they started with. The rain, as it falls from the clouds is
 of the same colour as those clouds, that is in its shaded side;
 unless indeed the sun's rays should break through them; in that case
 the rain will appear less dark than the clouds. And if the heavy
 masses of ruin of large mountains or of other grand buildings fall
 into the vast pools of water, a great quantity will be flung into
 the air and its movement will be in a contrary direction to that of
 the object which struck the water; that is to say: The angle of
 reflection will be equal to the angle of incidence. Of the objects carried
 </p><p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a></p>
 <p>down by the current, those which are heaviest or rather
 largest in mass will keep farthest from the two opposite shores. The
 water in the eddies revolves more swiftly in proportion as it is
 nearer to their centre. The crests of the waves of the sea tumble to
 their bases falling with friction on the bubbles of their sides; and
 this friction grinds the falling water into minute particles and
 this being converted into a dense mist, mingles with the gale in the
 manner of curling smoke and wreathing clouds, and at last it, rises
 into the air and is converted into clouds. But the rain which falls
 through the atmosphere being driven and tossed by the winds becomes
 rarer or denser according to the rarity or density of the winds that
 buffet it, and thus there is generated in the atmosphere a moisture
 formed of the transparent particles of the rain which is near to the
 eye of the spectator. The waves of the sea which break on the slope
 of the mountains which bound it, will foam from the velocity with
 which they fall against these hills; in rushing back they will meet
 the next wave as it comes and and after a loud noise return in a
 great flood to the sea whence they came. Let great numbers of
 inhabitants--men and animals of all kinds--be seen driven [54] by
 the rising of the deluge to the peaks of the mountains in the midst
 of the waters aforesaid.

 Of the water which leaps up from the spot where great masses fall on
 its surface. Of the winds of Piombino at Piombino. Eddies of wind
 and rain with boughs and shrubs mixed in the air. Emptying the boats
 of the rain water.

 3. The MS. Leic. being written about the year 1510 or later, it does
 not seem to me to follow that the sketches must have been made at
 Piombino, where Leonardo was in the year 1502 and possibly returned
 there subsequently (see Vol. II. Topographical notes).</p>
