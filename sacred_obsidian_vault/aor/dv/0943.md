 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF CERTAIN PERSONS WHO SAY THE WATERS WERE HIGHER THAN THE DRY LAND.</h3>
 <p>
 Certainly I wonder not a little at the common opinion which is
 contrary to truth, but held by the universal consent of the judgment
 of men. And this is that all are agreed that the surface of the sea
 is higher than the highest peaks of the mountains; and they allege
 many vain and childish reasons, against which I will allege only one
 simple and short reason; We see plainly that if we could remove the
 shores of the sea, it would invest the whole earth and make it a
 perfect sphere. Now, consider how much earth would be carried away
 to enable the waves of the sea to cover the world; therefore that
 which would be carried away must be higher than the sea-shore.
