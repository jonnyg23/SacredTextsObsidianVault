 </p><h3 align="CENTER">IN CONFIRMATION OF WHY THE WATER GOES TO THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.</h3>
 <p>
 I say that just as the natural heat of the blood in the veins keeps
 it in the head of man,--for when the man is dead the cold blood
 sinks to the lower parts--and when the sun is hot on the head of a
 man the blood increases and rises so much, with other humours, that
 by pressure in the veins pains in the head are often caused; in the
 same way veins ramify through the body of the earth, and by the
 natural heat which is distributed throughout the containing body,
 the water is raised through the veins to the tops of mountains. And
 this water, which passes through a closed conduit inside the body of
 the mountain like a dead thing, cannot come forth from its low place
 unless it is warmed by the vital heat of the spring time. Again, the
 heat of the element of fire and, by day, the heat of the sun, have
 power to draw forth the moisture of the low parts of the mountains
 and to draw them up, in the same way as it draws the clouds and
 collects their moisture from the bed of the sea.
