 Wine, the divine juice of the grape, finding itself in a golden and
 richly wrought cup, on the table of Mahomet, was puffed up with
 pride at so much honour; when suddenly it was struck by a contrary
 reflection, saying to itself: "What am I about, that I should
 rejoice, and not perceive that I am now near to my death and shall
 leave my golden abode in this cup to enter into the foul and fetid
 caverns of the human body, and to be transmuted from a fragrant and
 delicious liquor into a foul and base one. Nay, and as though so
 much evil as this were not enough, I must for a long time lie in
 hideous receptacles, together with other fetid and corrupt matter,
 cast out from human intestines." And it cried to Heaven, imploring
 vengeance for so much insult, and that an end might henceforth be
 put to such contempt; and that, since that country produced the
 finest and best grapes in the whole world, at least they should not
 be turned into wine. Then Jove made that wine drunk by Mahomet to
 rise in spirit to his brain; and that in so deleterious a manner
 that it made him mad, and gave birth to so many follies that when he
 had recovered himself, he made a law that no Asiatic should drink
 wine, and henceforth the vine and its fruit were left free.

 As soon as wine has entered the stomach it begins to ferment and
 swell; then the spirit of that man begins to abandon his body,
 rising as it were skywards, and the brain finds itself parting from
 the body. Then it begins to degrade him, and make him rave like a
 madman, and then he does irreparable evil, killing his friends.
