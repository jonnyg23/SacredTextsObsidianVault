 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The movement of the arm (350-354).</font></span>In the innermost bend of the joints of every limb the reliefs are
 converted into a hollow, and likewise every hollow of the innermost
 bends becomes a convexity when the limb is straightened to the
 utmost. And in this very great mistakes are often made by those who
 have insufficient knowledge and trust to their own invention and do
 not have recourse to the imitation of nature; and these variations
 occur more in the middle of the sides than in front, and more at the
 back than at the sides.
