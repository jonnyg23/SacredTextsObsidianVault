 jump out of the water, as may be seen with dolphins; and it seems a
 wonderful thing to make a leap from a thing which does not resist
 but slips away. Of the swimming of animals of a long form, such as
 eels and the like. Of the mode of swimming against currents and in
 the rapid falls of rivers. Of the mode of swimming of fishes of a
 round form. How it is that animals which have not long hind quartres
 cannot swim. How it is that all other animals which have feet with
 toes, know by nature how to swim, excepting man. In what way man
 ought to learn to swim. Of the way in which man may rest on the
 water. How man may protect himself against whirlpools or eddies in
 the water, which drag him down. How a man dragged to the bottom must
 seek the reflux which will throw him up from the depths. How he
 ought to move his arms. How to swim on his back. How he can and how
 he cannot stay under water unless he can hold his breath [13]. How
 by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under

 <p>means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending
 ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them.
 And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them;
 because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the
 water supported on bags or corks [19].
