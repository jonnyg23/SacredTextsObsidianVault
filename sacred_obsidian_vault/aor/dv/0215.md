 Although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be
 narrower and shorter in foreshortening, the quality and quantity of
 the light and shade is not increased nor diminished.
 </p><p>
 [3]The function of shade and light when diminished by
 foreshortening, will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object
 opposite, according to the quality and quantity in which they fall
 on the body.
 </p><p>
 [5]In proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate
 extremities the deeper it will appear, <i>g z</i> beyond the intersection
 faces only the part of the shadow [marked] <i>y z</i>; this by
 intersection takes the shadow from <i>m n</i> but by direct line it takes
 the shadow <i>a m</i> hence it is twice as deep as <i>g z</i>. <i>Y x</i>, by
 intersection takes the shadow <i>n o</i>, but by direct line the shadow
 <i>n m a</i>, therefore <i>x y</i> is three times as dark as <i>z g</i>; <i>x f</i>, by
 intersection faces <i>o b</i> and by direct line <i>o n m a</i>, therefore we
 must say that the shadow between <i>f x</i> will be four times as dark as
 the shadow <i>z g</i>, because it faces four times as much shadow.
 </p><p>
 Let <i>a b</i> be the side where the primary shadow is, and <i>b c</i> the
 primary light, <i>d</i> will be the spot where it is intercepted,<i>f g</i>
 the derived shadow and <i>f e</i> the derived light.
 </p><p>
 And this must be at the beginning of the explanation.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_106"></a><a href="0215.htm#fr_106">119:104</a> : In the original MS. the text of No. 252 precedes the one
 given here. In the text of No. 215 there is a blank space of about
 four lines between the lines 2 and 3. The diagram given on <a href="pl006.htm#img_pl006">Pl. VI</a>,
 No. 2 is placed between lines 4 and 5. Between lines 5 and 6 there
 is another space of about three lines and one line left blank
 between lines 8 and 9. The reader will find the meaning of the whole
 passage much clearer if he first reads the final lines 11--13.
 Compare also line 4 of No. 270.</p>
