 <p>
 Of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning,

 horizon; and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun
 remain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist.

 Of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere, whether

 another, sees <i>c</i> the top of the first tower at <i>r</i>, at two degrees
 of depth in the mist; and sees the height of the middle tower <i>b</i>

 <i>c</i> appears stronger than the top of the tower <i>b</i>, &amp;c
