 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The Tyrrhene Sea.</font></span>Some at the Tyrrhene sea employ this method; that is to say they
 fastened an anchor to one end of the yard, and to the other a cord,
 of which the lower end was fastened to an anchor; and in battle they
 flung this anchor on to the oars of the opponent's boat and by the
 use of a capstan drew it to the side; and threw soft soap and tow,
 daubed with pitch and set ablaze, on to that side where the anchor
 hung; so that in order to escape that fire, the defenders of that
 ship had to fly to the opposite side; and in doing this they aided
 to the attack, because the galley was more easily drawn to the side
 by reason of the counterpoise.  <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="#fn_270"><font size="1">604</font></a>
