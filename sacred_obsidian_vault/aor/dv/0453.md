 All trees seen against the sun are dark towards the middle and this
 shadow will be of the shape of the tree when apart from others.
 </p><p>
 The shadows cast by trees on which the sun shines are as dark as
 those of the middle of the tree.
 </p><p>
 The shadow cast by a tree is never less than the mass of the tree
 but becomes taller in proportion as the spot on which it falls,
 slopes towards the centre of the world.
 </p><p>
 The shadow will be densest in the middle of the tree when the tree
 has the fewest branches.

 Every branch participates of the central shadow of every other
 branch and consequently [of that] of the whole tree.
 </p><p>
 The form of any shadow from a branch or tree is circumscribed by the
 light which falls from the side whence the light comes; and this
 illumination gives the shape of the shadow, and this may be of the
 distance of a mile from the side where the sun is.

 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Light and shade on groups of trees (453-457).</font></span>If it happens that a cloud should anywhere overshadow some part of a
 hill the [shadow of the] trees there will change less than in the
 plains; for these trees on the hills have their branches thicker,
 because they grow less high each year than in the plains. Therefore
 as these branches are dark by nature and being so full of shade, the
 shadow of the clouds cannot darken them any more; but the open
 spaces between the trees, which have no strong shadow change very
 much in tone and particularly those which vary from green; that is
 ploughed lands or fallen mountains or barren lands or rocks. Where
 the trees are against the atmosphere they appear all the same
 colour--if indeed they are not very close together or very thickly
 covered with leaves like the fir and similar trees. When you see the
 trees from the side from which the sun lights them, you will see
 them almost all of the same tone, and the shadows in them will be
 hidden by the leaves in the light, which come between your eye and
 those shadows.

  When
 the trees are situated between the sun and the eye, beyond the
 shadow which spreads from their centre, the green of their leaves
 will be seen transparent; but this transparency will be broken in
 many places by the leaves and boughs in shadow which will come
 between you and them, or, in their upper portions, they will be
 accompanied by many lights reflected from the leaves.
