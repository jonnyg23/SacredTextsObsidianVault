 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The distribution of light and shade (556-559)</font></span>When you represent the dark shadows in bodies in light and shade,
 always show the cause of the shadow, and the same with reflections;
 because the dark shadows are produced by dark objects and the
 reflections by objects only moderately lighted, that is with
 diminished light. And there is the same proportion between the
 highly lighted part of a body and the part lighted by a reflection
 as between the origin of the lights on the body and the origin of
 the reflections.
