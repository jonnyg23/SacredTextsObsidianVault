  If it is
 from the centre that the sun employs its radiance to intensify the
 power of its whole mass, it is evident that the farther its rays
 extend, the more widely they will be divided; and this being so,
 you, whose eye is near the water that mirrors the sun, see but a
 small portion of the rays of the sun strike the surface of the
 water, and reflecting the form of the sun. But if you were near to
 the sun--as would be the case when the sun is on the meridian and
 the sea to the westward--you would see the sun, mirrored in the

 <p>sea, of a very great size; because, as you are nearer to the sun, your
 eye taking in the rays nearer to the point of radiation takes more
 of them in, and a great splendour is the result. And in this way it
 can be proved that the moon must have seas which reflect the sun,
 and that the parts which do not shine are land.
