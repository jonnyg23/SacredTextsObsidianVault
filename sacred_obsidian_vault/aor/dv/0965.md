 It is the property of water that it constitutes the vital human of
 this arid earth; and the cause which moves it through its ramified
 veins, against the natural course of heavy matters, is the same
 property which moves the humours in every species of animal body.
 But that which crowns our wonder in contemplating it is, that it
 rises from the utmost depths of the sea to the highest tops of the
 mountains, and flowing from the opened veins returns to the low
 seas; then once more, and with extreme swiftness, it mounts again
 and returns by the same descent, thus rising from the inside to the
 outside, and going round from the lowest to the highest, from whence
 it rushes down in a natural course. Thus by these two movements
 combined in a constant circulation, it travels through the veins of
 the earth.
