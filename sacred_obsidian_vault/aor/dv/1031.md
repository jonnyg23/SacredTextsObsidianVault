 </p><h3 align="CENTER">AT BORMIO.</h3>
 <p>
 At Bormio are the baths;--About eight miles above Como is the
 Pliniana, which increases and ebbs every six hours, and its swell
 supplies water for two mills; and its ebbing makes the spring dry
 up; two miles higher up there is Nesso, a place where a river falls
 with great violence into a vast rift in the mountain. These
 excursions are to be made in the month of May. And the largest bare
 rocks that are to be found in this part of the country are the
 mountains of Mandello near to those of Lecco, and
 </p><p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>
 <p>of Gravidona
 towards Bellinzona, 30 miles from Lecco, and those of the valley of
 Chiavenna; but the greatest of all is that of Mandello, which has at
 its base an opening towards the lake, which goes down 200 steps, and
 there at all times is ice and wind.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">IN VAL SASINA.</h3>
 <p>
 In Val Sasina, between Vimognio and Introbbio, to the right hand,
 going in by the road to Lecco, is the river Troggia which falls from
 a very high rock, and as it falls it goes underground and the river
 ends there. 3 miles farther we find the buildings of the mines of
 copper and silver near a place called Pra' Santo Pietro, and mines
 of iron and curious things. La Grigna is the highest mountain there
 is in this part, and it is quite bare.

 <p><a name="fn_220"></a><a href="1031.htm#fr_220">239:554</a> : 1030 and 1031. From the character of the handwriting we
 may conclude that these observations were made in Leonardo's youth;
 and I should infer from their contents, that they were notes made in
 anticipation of a visit to the places here described, and derived
 from some person (unknown to us) who had given him an account of
 them.</p>
