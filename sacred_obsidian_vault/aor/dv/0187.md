 <p>
 The derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright
 light of the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade
 with the light derived from the window; and these various depths of
 shade modify every portion of the light, except where it is
 strongest, at <i>c</i>. To prove this let <i>d a</i> be the primary shadow
 which is turned towards the point <i>e</i>, and darkens it by its derived
 shadow; as may be seen by the triangle △ <i>a e d</i>, in which the
 angle <i>e</i> faces the darkened base <i>d a e</i>; the point <i>v</i> faces the
 dark shadow <i>a s</i> which is part of <i>a d</i>, and as the whole is
 greater than a part, <i>e</i>

 <p>which faces the whole base [of the
 triangle], will be in deeper shadow than <i>v</i> which only faces part
 of it. In consequence of the conclusion [shown] in the above
 diagram, <i>t</i> will be less darkened than <i>v</i>, because the base of the
 △ <i>t</i> is part of the base of the △ <i>v</i>; and in the same way it follows
 that <i>p</i> is less in shadow than <i>t</i>, because the base of the △ <i>p</i> is
 part of the base of the △ <i>t</i>. And <i>c</i> is the terminal point of the
 derived shadow and the chief beginning of the highest light.
