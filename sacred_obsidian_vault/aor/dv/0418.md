 A leaf always turns its upper side towards the sky so that it may
 the better receive, on all its surface, the dew which drops gently
 from the atmosphere. And these leaves are so distributed on the
 plant as that one shall cover the other as little as possible, but
 shall lie alternately one above another as may be seen in the ivy
 which covers the walls. And this alternation serves two ends; that
 is, to leave intervals by which the air and sun may penetrate
 between them. The 2nd reason is that the drops which fall from the
 first leaf may fall onto the fourth or--in other trees--onto the
 sixth.
