 <p>
 Which is the part in man, which, as he grows fatter, never gains
 flesh?
 </p><p>
 Or what part which as a man grows lean never falls away with a too
 perceptible diminution? And among the parts which grow fat which is
 that which grows fattest?
 </p><p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?
 </p><p>
 In very strong men which are the muscles which are thickest and most
 prominent?
 </p><p>
 In your anatomy you must represent all the stages of the limbs from
 man's creation to his death, and then till the death of the bone;
 and which part of him is first decayed and which is preserved the
 longest.
 </p><p>
 And in the same way of extreme leanness and extreme fatness.
