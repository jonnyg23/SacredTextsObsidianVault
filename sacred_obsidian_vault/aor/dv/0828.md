 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Advantages in the structure of the eye in certain animals (828-831).</font></span>Every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,
 and larger in the morning than at midday.
 </p><p>
 This happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday
 than at any other time.
 </p><p>
 In proportion as the eye or the pupil of the owl is larger in
 proportion to the animal than that of man, so much the more light
 can it see at night than man can; hence at midday it can see nothing
 if its pupil does not diminish; and, in the same way, at night
 things look larger to it than by day.
