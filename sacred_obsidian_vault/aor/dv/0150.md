 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the intensity of shadows as dependent on the distance from the light (150-152).</font></span>The smaller the light that falls upon an object the more shadow it
 will display. And the light will illuminate a smaller portion of the
 object in proportion as it is nearer to it; and conversely, a larger
 extent of it in proportion as it is farther off.
 </p><p>
 A light which is smaller than the object on which it falls will
 light up a smaller extent of it in proportion as it is nearer to it,
 and the converse, as it is farther from it. But when the light is
 larger than the object illuminated it will light a larger extent of
 the object in proportion as it is nearer and the converse when they
 are farther apart.
