 <p>
 A man pulling a [dead] weight balanced against himself cannot pull
 more than his own weight. And if he has to raise it he will [be able
 to] raise as much more than his weight as his strength may be more
 than that of other men.  <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">190</font></a>
  The greatest force a man can
 apply, with equal velocity and impetus, will be when he sets his
 feet on one end of the balance [or lever] and then presses his
 shoulders against some stable body. This will raise a weight at the
 other end of the balance [lever], equal to his own weight and [added
 to that] as much weight as he can carry on his shoulders.

 <p><a name="fn_192"></a><a href="0383.htm#fr_192">198:190</a>  7: The stroke at the end of this
 line finishes in the original in a sort of loop or flourish, and a
 similar flourish occurs at the end of the previous passage written
 on the same page. M. RAVAISSON regards these as numbers (compare the
 photograph of page 30b in his edition of MS. A). He remarks: "<i>Ce
 chiffre</i> 8 <i>et, a la fin de l'alinea precedent, le chiffre</i> 7 <i>sont,
 dans le manuscrit, des renvois</i>."</p>
