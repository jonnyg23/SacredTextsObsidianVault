 should have depreciated that solar body, saying that it was of the
 nature of incandescent stone, and the one who opposed him as to that
 error was not far wrong. But I only wish I had words to serve me to
 blame those who are fain to extol the worship of men more than that
 of the sun; for in the whole universe there is nowhere to be seen a
 body of greater magnitude and power than the sun. Its light gives
 light to all the celestial bodies which are distributed throughout
 the universe; and from it descends all vital force, for the heat
 that is in living beings comes from the soul [vital spark]; and
 there is no other centre of heat and light in the universe as will
 be shown in Book 4; and certainly those who have chosen to worship
 men as gods--as Jove, Saturn, Mars and the like--have fallen into
 the gravest error, seeing that even if a man were as large as our
 earth, he would look no bigger than a little star which appears but
 as a speck in the universe; and seeing again that these men are
 mortal, and putrid and corrupt in their sepulchres.

 <p><a name="fn_124"></a><a href="0880.htm#fr_124">149:458</a>  2: <i>Socrates;</i> I have little light to throw on this
 reference. Plato's Socrates himself declares on more than one
 occasion that in his youth he had turned his mind to the study of
 celestial phenomena (METEWPA) but not in his later years (see G. C.
 LEWIS, <i>The Astronomy of the ancients</i>, page 109; MADLER,
 <i>Geschichte der Himmelskunde</i>, page 41). Here and there in Plato's
 writings we find incidental notes on the sun and other heavenly
 bodies. Leonardo may very well have known of these, since the Latin
 version by Ficinus was printed as early as 1491; indeed an undated
 edition exists which may very likely have appeared between 1480--90.
 </p><p>
 There is but one passage in Plato, Epinomis (p. 983) where he speaks
 of the physical properties of the sun and says that it is larger
 than the earth.
 </p><p>
 Aristotle who goes very fully into the subject says the same. A
 complete edition of Aristotele's works was first printed in Venice
 1495-98, but a Latin version of the Books <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> and
 <i>De Physica</i> had been printed in Venice as early as in 1483 (H. MULLER-STRUBING).</p>

 who is named in the margin. It may be Nonius Marcellus, an obscure
 Roman Grammarian of uncertain date (between the IInd and Vth
 centuries A. C.) the author of the treatise <i>De compendiosa doctrina
 per litteras ad filium</i> in which he treats <i>de rebus omnibus et
 quibusdam aliis</i>. This was much read in the middle ages. The <i>editto
 princeps</i> is dated 1470 (H. MULLER-STRUBING).</p>
