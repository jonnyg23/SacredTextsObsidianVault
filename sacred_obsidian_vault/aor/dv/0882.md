 Epicurus says the sun is the size it looks. Hence as it looks about
 a foot across we must consider that to be its size; it would follow
 that when the moon eclipses the sun, the sun ought not to appear the
 larger, as it does. Then, the moon being smaller than the sun, the
 moon must be less than a foot, and consequently when our world
 eclipses the moon, it must be less than a foot by a finger's
 breadth; inasmuch as if the sun is a foot across, and our earth
 casts a conical shadow on the moon, it is inevitable that the
 luminous cause of the cone of shadow must be larger than the opaque
 body which casts the cone of shadow.
