 You will see in the lower branches of the elder, which puts forth
 leaves two and two placed crosswise [at right angles] one above
 another, that if the stem rises straight up towards the sky this
 order never fails; and its largest leaves are on the thickest part
 of the stem and the smallest on the slenderest part, that is towards
 the top. But, to return to the lower branches, I say that the leaves
 on these are placed on them crosswise like [those on] the upper
 branches; and as, by the law of all leaves, they are compelled to
 turn their upper surface towards the sky to catch the dew at night,
 it is necessary that those so placed should twist round and no
 longer form a cross.
