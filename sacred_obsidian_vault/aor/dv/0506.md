 <p>
 The mind of the painter must resemble a mirror, which always takes
 the colour of the object it reflects and is completely occupied by
 the images of as many objects as are in front of it. Therefore you
 must know, Oh Painter! that you cannot be a good one if you are not
 the universal master of representing by your art every kind of form
 produced by nature. And this you will not know how to do if you do
 not see them, and retain them in your mind. Hence as you go through
 the fields, turn your attention to various objects, and, in turn
 look now at this thing and now at that, collecting a store of divers
 facts selected and chosen from those of less value. But do not do
 like some painters who, when they are wearied with exercising their
 fancy dismiss their work from their thoughts and take exercise in
 walking for relaxation, but still keep fatigue in their mind which,
 though they see various objects [around them], does not apprehend
 them; but, even when they meet friends or relations and are saluted
 by them, although they see and hear them, take no more cognisance of
 them than if they had met so much empty air.
