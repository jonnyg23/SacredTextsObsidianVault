 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The disorder in the MSS.</font></span>Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the
 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without
 order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to
 arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of
 which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of
 this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times;
 for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and
 memory cannot retain them [all] and say: 'I will not write this
 because I wrote it before.' And if I wished to avoid falling into
 this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to
 copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all
 that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long
 between one time of writing and the next.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_5"></a><a href="0004.htm#fr_5">12:3</a> : 1. In the history of Florence in the early part of the
 XVIth century <i>Piero di Braccio Martelli</i> is frequently mentioned as
 <i>Commissario della Signoria</i>. He was famous for his learning and at
 his death left four books on Mathematics ready for the press; comp.
 LITTA, <i>Famiglie celebri Italiane</i>, <i>Famiglia Martelli di
 Firenze</i>.--In the Official Catalogue of MSS. in the Brit. Mus., New
 Series Vol. I., where this passage is printed, <i>Barto</i> has been
 wrongly given for Braccio.
 </p><p>
 2. <i>addi 22 di marzo 1508</i>. The Christian era was computed in
 Florence at that time from the Incarnation (Lady day, March 25th).
 Hence this should be 1509 by our reckoning.
 </p><p>
 3. <i>racolto tratto di molte carte le quali io ho qui copiate</i>. We
 must suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS.
 and not those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the
 Brit. Mus. are a fair copy of some notes on physics.</p>
