 Just so much as the part <i>d a</i> of the nude figure decreases in this
 position so much does the opposite part increase; that is: in
 proportion as the length of the part <i>d a</i> diminishes the normal
 size so does the opposite upper part increase beyond its [normal]
 size. The navel does not change its position to the male organ; and
 this shrinking arises because when a figure stands on one foot, that
 foot becomes the centre [of gravity] of the superimposed weight.
 This being so, the middle between the shoulders is thrust above it
 out of it perpendicular line, and this line, which forms the central
 line of the external parts of the body, becomes bent at its upper
 extremity [so as to be] above the foot which supports the body; and
 the transverse lines are forced into such angles that their ends are
 lower on the side which is supported. As is shown at <i>a b c</i>.
