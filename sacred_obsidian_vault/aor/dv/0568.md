 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE REASON WHY SMALL FIGURES SHOULD NOT BE MADE FINISHED.</h3>
 <p>
 I say that the reason that objects appear diminished in size is
 because they are remote from the eye; this being the case it is
 evident that there must be a great extent of atmosphere between the
 eye and the objects, and this air interferes with the distinctness
 of the forms of the object. Hence the minute details of these
 objects will be indistinguishable and unrecognisable. Therefore, O
 Painter, make your smaller figures merely indicated and not highly
 finished, otherwise you will produce effects the opposite to nature,
 your supreme guide. The object is small by reason of the great
 distance between it and the eye, this great distance is filled with
 air, that mass of air forms a dense body which intervenes and
 prevents the eye seeing the minute details of objects.
