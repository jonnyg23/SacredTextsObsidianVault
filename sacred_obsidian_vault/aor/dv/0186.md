 Why the intersections at <i>n</i> being composed of two compound derived

 <p>forms a compound shadow and not a simple one, as happens
 with other intersections of compound shadows. This occurs, according
 to the 2nd [diagram] of this [prop.] which says:--The intersection
 of derived shadows when produced by the intersection of columnar
 shadows caused by a single light does not produce a simple shadow.
 And this is the corollary of the 1st [prop.] which says:--The
 intersection of simple derived shadows never results in a deeper
 shadow, because the deepest shadows all added together cannot be
 darker than one by itself. Since, if many deepest shadows increased
 in depth by their duplication, they could not be called the
 <i>deepest</i> shadows, but only part-shadows. But if such intersections
 are illuminated by a second light placed between the eye and the
 intersecting bodies, then those shadows would become compound
 shadows and be uniformly dark just as much at the intersection as
 throughout the rest. In the 1st and 2nd above, the intersections <i>i
 k</i> will not be doubled in depth as it is doubled in quantity. But in
 this 3rd, at the intersections <i>g n</i> they will be double in depth
 and in quantity.
