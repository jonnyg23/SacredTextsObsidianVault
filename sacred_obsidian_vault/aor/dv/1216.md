 [Amid the vastness of the things among which we live, the existence
 of nothingness holds the first place; its function extends over all
 things that have no existence, and
 </p><p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a></p>
 <p>its essence, as regards time,
 lies precisely between the past and the future, and has nothing in
 the present. This nothingness has the part equal to the whole, and
 the whole to the part, the divisible to the indivisible; and the
 product of the sum is the same whether we divide or multiply, and in
 addition as in subtraction; as is proved by arithmeticians by their
 tenth figure which represents zero; and its power has not extension
 among the things of Nature.]
 </p><p>
 [What is called Nothingness is to be found only in time and in
 speech. In time it stands between the past and future and has no
 existence in the present; and thus in speech it is one of the things
 of which we say: They are not, or they are impossible.]
 </p><p>
 With regard to time, nothingness lies between the past and the
 future, and has nothing to do with the present, and as to its nature
 it is to be classed among things impossible: hence, from what has
 been said, it has no existence; because where there is nothing there
 would necessarily be a vacuum.
