 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ALL BODIES, IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE NEARER TO, OR FARTHER FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT, WILL PRODUCE LONGER OR SHORTER DERIVED SHADOWS.</h3>
 <p>
 Among bodies of equal size, that one which is illuminated by the
 largest light will have the shortest shadow. Experiment confirms
 this proposition. Thus the body <i>m</i> <i>n</i> is surrounded by a larger
 amount of light
 </p><p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a></p>
 <p>than the body <i>p q</i>, as is shown above. Let us say
 that <i>v c a b d x</i> is the sky, the source of light, and that <i>s t</i>
 is a window by which the luminous rays enter, and so <i>m n</i> and <i>p q</i>
 are bodies in light and shade as exposed to this light; <i>m n</i> will
 have a small derived shadow, because its original shadow will be
 small; and the derivative light will be large, again, because the
 original light <i>c d</i> will be large and <i>p q</i> will have more derived
 shadow because its original shadow will be larger, and its derived
 light will be smaller than that of the body <i>m n</i> because that
 portion of the hemisphere <i>a b</i> which illuminates it is smaller than
 the hemisphere <i>c d</i> which illuminates the body <i>m n</i>.
