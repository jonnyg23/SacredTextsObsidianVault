 Here there cannot and ought not to be any <i>campanile</i>; on the
 contrary it must stand apart like that of the Cathedral and of San
 Giovanni at Florence, and of the Cathedral at Pisa, where the
 campanile is quite detached as well as the dome. Thus each can
 display its own perfection. If however you wish to join it to the
 church, make the lantern serve for the campanile as in the church at
 Chiaravalle.

 a central tower on the intersection of the cross in the style of
 that of the Certosa of Pavia, but the style is mediaeval (A. D.
 1330). Leonardo seems here to mean, that in a building, in which the
 circular form is strongly conspicuous, the campanile must either be
 separated, or rise from the centre of the building and therefore
 take the form of a lantern.</p>
