 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY DOGS TAKE PLEASURE IN SMELLING AT EACH OTHER.</h3>
 <p>
 This animal has a horror of the poor, because they eat poor food,
 and it loves the rich, because they have good living and especially
 meat. And the excrement of animals always retains some virtue of its
 origin as is shown by the faeces ...
 </p><p>
 Now dogs have so keen a smell, that they can discern by their nose
 the virtue remaining in these faeces, and if they find them in the
 streets, smell them and if they smell in them the virtue of meat or
 of other things, they take them, and if not, they leave them: And to
 return to the question, I say that if by means of this smell they
 know that dog to be well fed, they respect him, because they judge
 that he has a powerful and rich master; and if they discover no such
 smell with the virtue of meat, they judge that dog to be of small
 account and to have a poor and humble master, and therefore they
 bite that dog as they would his master.
