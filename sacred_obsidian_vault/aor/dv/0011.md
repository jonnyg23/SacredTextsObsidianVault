 Though I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall
 rely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience,
 the mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous,
 dressed and decorated with [the fruits], not of their own labours,
 but of those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will
 scorn me as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not
 inventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be
 blamed.

 <p>
 And those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and
 Man, as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of
 others, must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the
 object in front of a mirror, when compared with its image seen in
 the mirror. For the first is something in itself, and the other
 nothingness.--Folks little indebted to Nature, since it is only by
 chance that they wear the human form and without it I might class
 them with the herds of beasts.
