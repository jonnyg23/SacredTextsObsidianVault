 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF PAINTING.</h3>
 <p>
 Colours seen in shadow will display more or less of their natural
 brilliancy in proportion as they are in fainter or deeper shadow.
 </p><p>
 But if these same colours are situated in a well-lighted place, they
 will appear brighter in proportion as the light is more brilliant.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE ADVERSARY.</h3>
 <p>
 The variety of colours in shadow must be as great as that of the
 colours in the objects in that shadow.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE ANSWER.</h3>
 <p>
 Colours seen in shadow will display less variety in proportion as
 the shadows in which they lie are deeper. And evidence of this is to
 be had by looking from an open space into the doorways of dark and
 shadowy churches, where the pictures which are painted in various
 colours all look of uniform darkness.
 </p><p>
 Hence at a considerable distance all the shadows of different
 colours will appear of the same darkness.
 </p><p>
 It is the light side of an object in light and shade which shows the
 true colour.
