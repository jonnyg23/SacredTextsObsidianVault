 Envy must be represented with a contemptuous motion of the hand
 towards heaven, because if she could she would use her strength
 against God; make her with her face covered by a mask of fair
 seeming; show her as wounded in the eye by a palm branch and by an
 olive-branch, and wounded in the ear by laurel and myrtle, to
 signify that victory and truth are odious to her. Many thunderbolts
 should proceed from her to signify her evil speaking. Let her be
 lean and haggard because she is in perpetual torment. Make her heart
 gnawed by a swelling serpent, and make her with a quiver with
 tongues serving as arrows, because she often offends with it. Give
 her a leopard's skin, because this creature kills the lion out of
 envy and by deceit. Give her too a vase in her hand full of flowers
 and scorpions and toads and other venomous creatures; make her ride
 upon death, because Envy, never dying, never tires of ruling. Make
 her bridle, and load her with divers kinds

 <p>of arms because all her
 weapons are deadly.

 Toleration.
 </p><p>
 Intolerable.

 No sooner is Virtue born than Envy comes into the world to attack
 it; and sooner will there be a body without a shadow than Virtue
 without Envy.

 <p><a name="fn_316"></a><a href="0677.htm#fr_316">354:314</a> : The larger of the two drawings on <a href="pl061.htm#img_pl061">Pl. LXI</a> is explained by
 the first 21 lines of this passage. L. 22 and 23, which are written
 above the space between the two drawings, do not seem to have any
 reference to either. L. 24-27 are below the allegorical twin figure
 which they serve to explain.</p>
