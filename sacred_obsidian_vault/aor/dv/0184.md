 Why, at the intersections <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> of the two compound shadows <i>e f</i>
 and <i>m e</i>, is a simple shadow pfoduced as at <i>e h</i> and <i>m g</i>, while
 no such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections <i>c
 d</i> made by the very same compound shadows?
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ANSWER.</h3>
 <p>
 Compound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows
 are simply darkness. Hence, of the two lights <i>n</i> and <i>o</i>, one falls
 on the compound shadow from one side, and the other on the compound
 shadow from the other side, but where they intersect no light falls,
 as at <i>a b</i>; therefore it is a simple shadow. Where there is a
 compound shadow one light or the other falls; and here a difficulty
 arises for my adversary since he says that, where the compound
 shadows intersect, both the lights which produce the shadows must of
 necessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised;
 inasmuch as the two lights do not fall there, we say that the shadow
 is a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls, we say
 the shadow is compound, and where both the lights fall the shadow is
 neutralised; for where both lights fall, no shadow of any kind is
 produced, but only a light background limiting the shadow. Here I
 shall say that what my adversary said was true: but he only mentions
 such truths as are in his favour; and if we go on to the rest he
 must conclude that my proposition is true. And that is: That if both
 lights fell on the
 </p><p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>
 <p>point of intersection, the shadows would be
 neutralised. This I confess to be true if [neither of] the two
 shadows fell in the same spot; because, where a shadow and a light
 fall, a compound shadow is produced, and wherever two shadows or two
 equal lights fall, the shadow cannot vary in any part of it, the
 shadows and the lights both being equal. And this is proved in the
 eighth [proposition] on proportion where it is said that if a given
 quantity has a single unit of force and resistance, a double
 quantity will have double force and double resistance.
