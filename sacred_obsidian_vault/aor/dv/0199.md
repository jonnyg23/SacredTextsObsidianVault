 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE OPINION OF SOME THAT A TRIANGLE CASTS NO SHADOW ON A PLANE SURFACE.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> A disputed proposition.</font></span>Certain mathematicians have maintained that a triangle, of which the
 base is turned to the light, casts no shadow on a plane; and this
 they prove by saying [5] that no spherical body smaller than the
 light can reach the middle with the shadow. The lines of radiant
 light are straight lines [6]; therefore, suppose the light to be <i>g
 h</i> and the triangle <i>l m n</i>, and let the plane be <i>i k</i>; they say
 the light <i>g</i> falls on the side of the triangle <i>l n</i>, and the
 portion of the plane <i>i q</i>. Thus again <i>h</i> like <i>g</i> falls on the
 side <i>l m</i>, and then on <i>m n</i> and the plane <i>p k</i>; and if the whole
 plane thus faces the lights <i>g h</i>, it is evident that the triangle
 has no shadow; and that which has no shadow can cast none. This, in
 this case appears credible. But if the triangle <i>n p g</i> were not
 illuminated by the two lights <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, but by <i>i p</i> and <i>g</i> and
 <i>k</i> neither side is lighted by more than one single light: that is
 <i>i p</i> is invisible to <i>h g</i> and <i>k</i> will never be lighted by <i>g</i>;
 hence <i>p q</i> will be twice as light as the two visible portions that
 are in shadow.
