 The first and most important thing is stability.

 As to the foundations of the component parts of temples and other
 public buildings, the depths of the foundations must bear the same
 proportions to each other as the weight of material which is to be
 placed upon them.

 Every part of the depth of earth in a given space is composed of
 layers, and each layer is composed of heavier or lighter materials,
 the lowest being the heaviest. And this can be proved, because these
 layers have been formed by the sediment from water carried down to
 the sea, by the current of rivers which flow into it. The heaviest
 part of this sediment was that which was first thrown down, and so
 on by degrees; and this is the action of water when it becomes
 stagnant, having first brought down the mud whence it first flowed.
 And such layers of soil are seen in the banks of rivers, where their
 constant flow has cut through them and divided one slope from the
 other to a great depth; where in gravelly strata the waters have run
 off, the materials
