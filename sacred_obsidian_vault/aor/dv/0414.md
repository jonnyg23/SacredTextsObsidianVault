 In the walnut tree the leaves which are distributed on the shoots of
 this year are further apart from each other and more numerous in
 proportion as the branch from which this shoot springs is a young
 one. And they are inserted more closely and less in number when the
 shoot that bears them springs from an old branch. Its fruits are
 borne at the ends of the shoots. And its largest boughs are the
 lowest on the boughs they spring from. And this arises from the
 weight of its sap which is more apt to descend than to rise, and
 consequently the branches which spring from them and rise towards
 the sky are small and slender [20]; and when the shoot turns towards
 the sky its leaves spread out from it [at an angle] with an equal
 distribution of their tips; and if the shoot turns to the horizon
 the leaves lie flat; and this arises from the fact that leaves
 without exception, turn their underside to the earth [29].

 The shoots are smaller in proportion as they spring nearer to the
 base of the bough they spring from.
