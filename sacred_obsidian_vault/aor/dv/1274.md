 A small patch of snow finding itself clinging to the top of a rock
 which was lying on the topmost height of a very high mountain and

 having placed myself--such a small patch of snow--in so lofty a
 spot, and for allowing that so large a quantity of snow as I have
 seen here around me, should take a place lower than mine? Certainly
 my small dimensions by no means merit this elevation. How easily may
 I, in proof of my insignificance, experience the same fate as that
 which the sun brought about yesterday to my companions, who were
 all, in a few hours, destroyed by the sun. And this happened from
 their having placed themselves higher than became them. I will flee
 from the wrath of the sun, and humble myself and find a place

 snow which was destroyed that summer by the sun. This is said for
 those who, humbling themselves, become exalted.
