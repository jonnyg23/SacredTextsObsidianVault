 <p>
 In proportion as the current of the water given forth by the
 draining of the lake is slow or rapid in the dry river bed, so will
 this river be wider or narrower, or shallower or deeper in one place
 than another, according to this proposition: the flow and ebb of the
 sea which enters the Mediterranean from the ocean, and of the rivers
 which meet and struggle with it, will raise their waters more or
 less in proportion as the sea is wider or narrower.
