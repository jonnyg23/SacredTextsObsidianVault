 <p>action] is abundantly proved by the radiance of the
 solar body on which the human eye cannot dwell and besides this no
 less manifestly by the rays reflected from a concave mirror,
 which--when they strike the eye with such splendour that the eye
 cannot bear them--have a brilliancy equal to the sun in its own
 place. And that this is true I prove by the fact that if the mirror
 has its concavity formed exactly as is requisite for the collecting
 and reflecting of these rays, no created being could endure the
 heat that strikes from the reflected rays of such a mirror. And if
 you argue that the mirror itself is cold and yet send forth hot
 rays, I should reply that those rays come really from the sun and
 that it is the ray of the concave mirror after having passed through
 the window.
