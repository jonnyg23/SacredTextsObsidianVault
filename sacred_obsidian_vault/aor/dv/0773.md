 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE CAUSES OF FISSURES IN [THE WALLS OF] PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUILDINGS.</h3>
 <p>
 The walls give way in cracks, some of which are more or less
 vertical and others are oblique. The cracks which are in a vertical
 direction are caused by the joining of new walls, with old walls,
 whether straight or with indentations fitting on to those of the old
 wall; for, as these indentations cannot bear the too great weight of
 the wall added on to them, it is inevitable that they should break,
 and give way to the settling of the new wall, which will shrink one
 braccia in every ten, more or less, according to the greater or
 smaller quantity of mortar used between the stones of the masonry,
 and whether this mortar is more or less liquid. And observe, that
 the walls should always be built first and then faced with the
 stones intended to face them. For, if you do not proceed thus, since
 the wall settles more than the stone facing, the projections left on
 the sides of the wall must inevitably give way; because the stones
 used for facing the wall being larger than those over which they are
 laid, they will necessarily have less mortar laid between the
 joints, and consequently they settle less; and this cannot happen if
 the facing is added after the wall is dry.
 </p><p>
 <i>a b</i> the new wall, <i>c</i> the old wall, which has already settled; and
 the part <i>a b</i> settles afterwards, although <i>a</i>, being founded on
 <i>c</i>, the old wall, cannot possibly break, having a stable foundation
 on the old wall. But only the remainder <i>b</i> of the new wall will
 break away, because it is built from top to bottom of the building;
 and the remainder of the new wall will overhang the gap above the
 wall that has sunk.
