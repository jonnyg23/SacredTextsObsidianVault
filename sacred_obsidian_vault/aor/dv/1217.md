 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Reflections on Nature (1217-1219).</font></span>[O mighty and once living instrument of formative nature. Incapable
 of availing thyself of thy vast strength thou hast to abandon a life
 of stillness and to obey the law which God and time gave to
 procreative nature.]

 Ah! how many a time the shoals of terrified dolphins and the huge
 tunny-fish were seen to flee before thy cruel fury, to escape;
 whilst thy fulminations raised in the sea a sudden tempest with
 buffeting and submersion of ships in the great waves; and filling
 the uncovered shores with the terrified and desperate fishes which
 fled from thee, and left by the sea, remained in spots where they
 became the abundant prey of the people in the neighbourhood.

 O time, swift robber of all created things, how many kings, how many
 nations hast thou undone, and how many changes of states and of
 various events have happened since the wondrous forms of this fish
 perished here in this cavernous and winding recess. Now destroyed by
 time thou liest patiently in this confined space with bones stripped
 and bare; serving as a support and prop for the superimposed
 mountain.
