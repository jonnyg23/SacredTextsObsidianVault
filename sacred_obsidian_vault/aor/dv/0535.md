 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY OF TWO OBJECTS OF EQUAL SIZE A PAINTED ONE WILL LOOK LARGER THAN A SOLID ONE.</h3>
 <p>
 The reason of this is not so easy to demonstrate as many others.
 Still I will endeavour to accomplish it, if not wholly, at any rate
 in part. The perspective of diminution demonstrates by reason, that
 objects diminish in proportion as they are farther from the eye, and
 this reasoning is confirmed by experience. Hence, the lines of sight
 that extend between the object and the eye, when they are directed
 to the surface of a painting are all intersected at uniform limits,
 while those lines which are directed towards a piece of sculpture
 are intersected at various limits and are of various lengths. The
 lines which are longest extend to a more remote limb than the others
 and therefore that limb looks smaller. As there are numerous lines
 each longer than the others--since there are numerous parts, each
 more remote than the others and these, being farther off,
 necessarily appear smaller, and by appearing smaller it follows that
 their diminution makes the whole mass of the object look smaller.
 But this does not occur in painting; since the lines of sight all
 end at

 <p>the same distance there can be no diminution, hence the parts
 not being diminished the whole object is undiminished, and for this
 reason painting does not diminish, as a piece of sculpture does.
