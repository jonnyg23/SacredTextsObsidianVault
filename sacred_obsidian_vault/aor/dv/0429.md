 Never paint leaves transparent to the sun, because they are
 confused; and this is because on the transparency of one leaf will
 be seen the shadow of another leaf which is above it. This shadow
 has a distinct outline and a certain depth of shade and sometimes is
 [as much as] half or a third of the leaf which is shaded; and
 consequently such an arrangement is very confused and the imitation
 of it should be avoided.

 The light shines least through a leaf when it falls upon it at an
 acute angle.
