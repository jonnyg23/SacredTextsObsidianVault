 A diminished object should be seen from the same distance, height
 and direction as the point of sight of your eye, or else your
 knowledge will produce no good effect.
 </p><p>
 And if you will not, or cannot, act on this principle--because as
 the plane on which you paint is to be seen by several persons you
 would need several points of sight which would make it look
 discordant and wrong--place yourself at a distance of at least 10
 times the size of the objects.
 </p><p>
 The lesser fault you can fall into then, will be that of
 representing all the objects in the foreground of their proper size,
 and on whichever side you are standing the objects thus seen will
 diminish themselves while the spaces between them will have no
 definite ratio. For, if you place yourself in the middle of a
 straight row [of objects], and look at several columns arranged in a
 line you will see, beyond a few columns separated by intervals, that
 the columns touch; and beyond where they touch they cover each
 other, till the last column projects but very little beyond the last
 but one. Thus the spaces between the
 </p><p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p>
 <p>columns are by degrees entirely
 lost. So, if your method of perspective is good, it will produce the
 same effect; this effect results from standing near the line in
 which the columns are placed. This method is not satisfactory unless
 the objects seen are viewed from a small hole, in the middle of
 which is your point of sight; but if you proceed thus your work will
 be perfect and will deceive the beholder, who will see the columns
 as they are here figured.

 Here the eye is in the middle, at the point <i>a</i> and near to the
 columns.
