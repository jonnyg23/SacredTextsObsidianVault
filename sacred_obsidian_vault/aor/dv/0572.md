 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF A METHOD OF KEEPING IN MIND THE FORM OF A FACE.</h3>
 <p>
 If you want to acquire facility for bearing in mind the expression
 of a face, first make yourself familiar with a variety of [forms of]
 several heads, eyes, noses, mouths, chins and cheeks and necks and
 shoulders: And to put a case: Noses are of 10 types: straight,
 bulbous, hollow, prominent above or below the middle, aquiline,
 regular, flat, round or pointed. These hold good as to profile. In
 full face they are of 11 types; these are equal thick in the middle,
 thin in the middle, with the tip thick and the root narrow, or
 narrow at the tip and wide at the root; with the nostrils wide or
 narrow, high or low, and the openings wide or hidden by the point;
 and you will find an equal variety in the other details; which
 things you must draw from nature and fix them in your mind. Or else,
 when you have to draw a face by heart, carry with you a little book
 in which you have noted such features; and when you have cast a
 glance at the face of the person you wish to draw, you can look, in
 private, which nose or mouth is most like, or there make a little
 mark to recognise it again at home. Of grotesque faces I need say
 nothing, because they are kept in mind without difficulty.
