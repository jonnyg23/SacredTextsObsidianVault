 <p>
 From the straits of Gibraltar to the Don is 3500 miles, that is one
 mile and 1/6, giving a fall of one braccio in a mile to any water
 that moves gently. The Caspian sea is a great deal higher; and none
 of the mountains of Europe rise a mile above the surface of our
 seas; therefore it might be said that the water which is on the
 summits of our mountains might come from the height of those seas,
 and of the rivers which flow into them, and which are still higher.
