 All bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding
 air an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each
 complete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body
 which produces it.
 </p><p>
 It can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,
 all-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in
 itself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images
 of the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation
 through which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and
 cause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside
 down on the dark plane where they are first reflected. The reason of
 this is--

 No. i) occurs in the original between lines 3 and 4. The three
 circles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which
 transmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark
 chamber, according to a law which is more fully explained in 75--81.
 So far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended
 to explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to
 coalesce at any given spot. In the circles are written,
 giallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.
