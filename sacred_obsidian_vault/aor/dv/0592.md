 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> How to pose figures.</font></span>The limbs should be adapted to the body with grace and with
 reference to the effect that you wish the figure to produce. And if
 you wish to produce a figure that shall of itself look light and
 graceful you must make the limbs elegant and extended, and without
 too much display of the muscles; and those few that are needed for
 your purpose you must indicate softly, that is, not very prominent
 and without strong shadows; the limbs, and particularly the arms
 easy; that is, none of the limbs should be in a straight line with
 the adjoining parts. And if the hips, which are the pole of a man,
 are by reason of his position, placed so, that the right is higher
 than the left, make the point of the higher shoulder in a
 perpendicular line above the highest prominence of the hip, and let
 this right shoulder be lower than the left. Let the pit of the
 throat always be over the centre of the joint of the foot on which
 the man is leaning. The leg which is free should have the knee lower
 than the other, and near the other leg. The positions of the head
 and arms are endless and I shall therefore not enlarge on any rules
 for them. Still, let them be easy and pleasing, with various turns
 and twists, and the joints gracefully bent, that they may not look
 like pieces of wood.
