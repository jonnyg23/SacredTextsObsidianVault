 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The laws of nutrition and the support of life (843-848).</font></span>The body of any thing whatever that takes nourishment constantly
 dies and is constantly renewed; because nourishment
 </p><p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>
 <p>can only enter
 into places where the former nourishment has expired, and if it has
 expired it no longer has life. And if you do not supply nourishment
 equal to the nourishment which is gone, life will fail in vigour,
 and if you take away this nourishment, the life is entirely
 destroyed. But if you restore as much is destroyed day by day, then
 as much of the life is renewed as is consumed, just as the flame of
 the candle is fed by the nourishment afforded by the liquid of this
 candle, which flame continually with a rapid supply restores to it
 from below as much as is consumed in dying above: and from a
 brilliant light is converted in dying into murky smoke; and this
 death is continuous, as the smoke is continuous; and the continuance
 of the smoke is equal to the continuance of the nourishment, and in
 the same instant all the flame is dead and all regenerated,
 simultaneously with the movement of its own nourishment.
