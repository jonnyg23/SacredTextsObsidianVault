 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Painting is superior to poetry (653. 654).</font></span>The eye, which is called the window of the soul, is the principal
 means by which the central sense can most completely and abundantly
 appreciate the infinite works of nature; and the ear is the second,
 which acquires dignity by hearing of the things the eye has seen. If
 you, historians, or poets, or mathematicians had not seen things
 with your eyes you could not report of them in writing. And if you,
 0 poet, tell a story with your pen, the painter with his brush can
 tell it more easily, with simpler completeness and less tedious to
 be understood. And if you call painting dumb poetry, the painter may
 call poetry blind painting. Now which is the worse defect? to be
 blind or dumb? Though the poet is as free as the painter in the
 invention of his fictions they are not so satisfactory to men as
 paintings; for, though poetry is able to describe forms, actions and
 places in words, the painter deals with the actual similitude of the
 forms, in order to represent them. Now tell me which is the nearer
 to the actual man: the name of man or the image of the man. The name
 of man differs in different countries, but his form is never changed
 but by death.
