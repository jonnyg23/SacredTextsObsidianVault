 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE BISON WHICH DOES INJURY IN ITS FLIGHT.</h3>
 <p>
 This beast is a native of Paeonia and has a neck with a mane like a
 horse. In all its other parts it is like a bull, excepting that its
 horns are in a way bent inwards so that it cannot butt; hence it has
 no safety but in flight, in which it flings out its excrement to a
 distance of 400 braccia in its course, and this burns like fire
 wherever it touches.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">LIONS, PARDS, PANTHERS, TIGERS.</h3>
 <p>
 These keep their claws in the sheath, and never put them out unless
 they are on the back of their prey or their enemy.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE LIONESS.</h3>
 <p>
 When the lioness defends her young from the hand of the hunter, in
 order not to be frightened by the spears she keeps her eyes on the
 ground, to the end that she may not by her flight leave her young
 ones prisoners.
