 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE KIND OF LIGHT REQUISITE FOR PAINTING LIGHT AND SHADE.</h3>
 <p>
 An object will display the greatest difference of light and shade
 when it is seen in the strongest light, as by sunlight, or, at
 night, by the light of a fire. But this should not be much used in
 painting because the works remain crude and ungraceful.
 </p><p>
 An object seen in a moderate light displays little difference in the
 light and shade; and this is the case towards evening or when the
 day is cloudy, and works then painted are tender and every kind of
 face becomes graceful. Thus, in every thing extremes are to be
 avoided: Too much light gives crudeness; too little prevents our
 seeing. The medium is best.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF SMALL LIGHTS.</h3>
 <p>
 Again, lights cast from a small window give strong differences of
 light and shade, all the more if the room lighted by it be large,
 and this is not good for painting.
