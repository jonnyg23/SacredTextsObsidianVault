 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE NATURE OF SHADOW.</h3>
 <p>
 Shadow partakes of the nature of universal matter. All such matters
 are more powerful in their beginning and grow weaker towards the
 end, I say at the beginning, whatever their form or condition may be
 and whether visible or invisible. And it is not from small
 beginnings that they grow to a great size in time; as it might be a
 great oak which has a feeble beginning from a small acorn. Yet I may
 say that the oak is most powerful at its beginning, that is where it
 springs from the earth, which is where it is largest (To return:)
 Darkness, then, is the strongest degree of shadow and light is its
 least. Therefore, O Painter, make your shadow darkest close to the
 object that casts it, and make the end of it fading into light,
 seeming to have no end.
