 </p><h3 align="CENTER">JUSTICE.</h3>
 <p>

 orders and arranges every thing with judgment. For some bees are
 ordered to go to the flowers, others are ordered to labour, others
 to fight with the wasps, others to clear away all dirt, others to
 <a href="errata.htm#1">accompany</a> and escort the king; and when he is old and has no wings
 they carry him. And if one of them fails in his duty, he is punished
 without reprieve.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TRUTH.</h3>
 <p>

 born of these eggs always return to their true mother.
