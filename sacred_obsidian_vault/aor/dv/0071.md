 <p>
 An experiment, showing how objects transmit their images or
 pictures, intersecting

 within the eye in the crystalline humour, is
 seen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of
 illuminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these
 images on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near
 to the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their
 proper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside
 down by reason of that very intersection. These images being
 transmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually
 painted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at
 from behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin
 plate of iron. Let <i>a b e d e</i> be the object illuminated by the sun
 and <i>o r</i> the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at
 <i>n m</i>. Let <i>s t</i> be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the
 images of these objects upside down, because the rays being
 straight, <i>a</i> on the right hand becomes <i>k</i> on the left, and <i>e</i> on
 the left becomes <i>f</i> on the right; and the same takes place inside
 the pupil.
