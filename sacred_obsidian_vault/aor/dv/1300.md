 speech; that is, a German with a Turk.
 </p><p>
 Fathers will be seen giving their daughters into the power of man
 and giving up all their former care in guarding them. (When Girls
 are married.)
 </p><p>
 Men will come out their graves turned into flying creatures; and
 they will attack other men, taking their food from their very hand
 or table. (As Flies.)

 Many will there be who, flaying their mother, will tear the skin
 from her back. (Husbandmen tilling the Earth.)
 </p><p>
 Happy will they be who lend ear to the words of the Dead. (Who read
 good works and obey them.)
