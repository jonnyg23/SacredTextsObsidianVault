 In landscapes which represent [a scene in] winter. The mountains
 should not be shown blue, as we see in the mountains in the summer.
 And this is proved  <a name="fr_228"></a><a href="#fn_228"><font size="1">226</font></a>
  in the 4th of this which says: Among mountains seen
 from a great distance those will look of the bluest colour which are
 in themselves the darkest; hence, when the trees are stripped of
 their leaves, they will show a bluer tinge which will be in itself
 darker; therefore, when the trees have lost their leaves they will
 look of a gray colour, while, with their leaves, they are green, and
 in proportion as the green is darker than the grey hue the green
 will be of a bluer tinge than the gray. Also by the 2nd of this: The
 shadows of trees covered with leaves are darker than the shadows of
 those trees which have lost their leaves in proportion as the trees
 covered with leaves are denser than those without leaves--and thus
 my meaning is proved.

 The definition of the blue colour of the atmosphere explains why the
 landscape is bluer in the summer than in the winter.
