 <p>
 Pleasure and Pain represent as twins, since there never is one
 without the other; and as if they were united back to back, since
 they are contrary to each other.

 If you take Pleasure know that he has behind him one who will deal
 you Tribulation and Repentance.

 [9] This represents Pleasure together with Pain, and show them as
 twins because one is never apart from the other. They are back to
 back because they are opposed to each other; and they exist as
 contraries in
 </p><p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a></p>
 <p>the same body, because they have the same basis,
 inasmuch as the origin of pleasure is labour and pain, and the
 various forms of evil pleasure are the origin of pain. Therefore it
 is here represented with a reed in his right hand which is useless
 and without strength, and the wounds it inflicts are poisoned. In
 Tuscany they are put to support beds, to signify that it is here
 that vain dreams come, and here a great part of life is consumed. It
 is here that much precious time is wasted, that is, in the morning,
 when the mind is composed and rested, and the body is made fit to
 begin new labours; there again many vain pleasures are enjoyed; both
 by the mind in imagining impossible things, and by the body in
 taking those pleasures that are often the cause of the failing of
 life. And for these reasons the reed is held as their support.

 Evil-thinking is either Envy or Ingratitude.

 <p><a name="fn_312"></a><a href="0676.htm#fr_312">352:310</a> : 7. <i>oro. fango</i>: gold, clay. These words stand below the
 allegorical figure.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_313"></a><a href="0676.htm#fr_313">353:311</a> : 676. The pen and ink drawing on <a href="pl059.htm#img_pl059">Pl. LIX</a> belongs to this
 passage.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_314"></a><a href="0676.htm#fr_314">353:312</a> : 8. <i>tribolatione</i>. In the drawing caltrops may be seen
 lying in the old man's right hand, others are falling and others
 again are shewn on the ground. Similar caltrops are drawn in MS.
 Tri. p. 98 and underneath them, as well as on page 96 the words
 <i>triboli di ferro</i> are written. From the accompanying text it
 appears that they were intended to be scattered on the ground at the
 bottom of ditches to hinder the advance of the enemy. Count Giulio
 Porro who published a short account of the Trivulzio MS. in the
 "<i>Archivio Storico Lombardo</i>", Anno VIII part IV (Dec. 31, 1881) has
 this note on the passages treating of "<i>triboli</i>": "<i>E qui
 aggiungerò che anni sono quando venne fabbricata la nuova
 cavallerizza presso il castello di Milano, ne furono trovati due che
 io ho veduto ed erano precisamente quali si trovano descritti e
 disegnati da Leonardo in questo codice</i>".
 </p><p>
 There can therefore be no doubt that this means of defence was in
 general use, whether it were originally Leonardo's invention or not.
 The play on the word "<i>tribolatione</i>", as it occurs in the drawing
 at Oxford, must then have been quite intelligible.</p>

 left side of the page and refer to the figure shown on <a href="pl061.htm#img_pl061">Pl. LXI</a>. Next
 to it is placed the group of three figures given in <a href="pl060.htm#img_pl060">Pl. LX</a> No. I.
 Lines 21 and 22, which are written under it, are the only
 explanation given.</p>
