 <h3 align="CENTER">OF THE NATURE OF SIGHT.</h3>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the conditions of sight (834. 835).</font></span>I say that sight is exercised by all animals, by the medium of
 light; and if any one adduces, as against this, the sight of
 nocturnal animals, I must say that this in the same way is subject
 to the very same natural laws. For it will easily be understood that
 the senses which receive the images of things do not project from
 themselves any visual virtue  <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">431</font></a>
 . On the
 contrary the atmospheric medium which exists between the object and
 the sense incorporates in itself the figure of things, and by its
 contact with the sense transmits the object to it. If the
 object--whether by sound or by odour--presents its spiritual force
 to the ear or the nose, then light is not required and does not act.
 The forms of objects do not send their images into
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 125</font></a></p>
 <p>the air if they
 are not illuminated [8]; and the eye being thus constituted cannot
 receive that from the air, which the air does not possess, although
 it touches its surface. If you choose to say that there are many
 animals that prey at night, I answer that when the little light
 which suffices the nature of their eyes is wanting, they direct
 themselves by their strong sense of hearing and of smell, which are
 not impeded by the darkness, and in which they are very far superior
 to man. If you make a cat leap, by daylight, among a quantity of
 jars and crocks you will see them remain unbroken, but if you do the
 same at night, many will be broken. Night birds do not fly about
 unless the moon shines full or in part; rather do they feed between
 sun-down and the total darkness of the night.

 No body can be apprehended without light and shade, and light and
 shade are caused by light.
