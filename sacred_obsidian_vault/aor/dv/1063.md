 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The Appenins (1063-1068).</font></span>That part of the earth which was lightest remained farthest from the
 centre of the world; and that part of the earth became the lightest
 over which the greatest quantity of water flowed. And therefore that
 part became lightest where the greatest number of rivers flow; like
 the Alps which divide Germany and France from Italy; whence issue
 the Rhone flowing Southwards, and the Rhine to the North. The Danube
 or Tanoia towards the North East, and the Po to the East, with
 innumerable rivers which join them, and which always run turbid with
 the soil carried by them to the sea.
 </p><p>
 The shores of the sea are constantly moving towards the middle of
 the sea and displace it from its original position. The lowest
 portion of the Mediterranean will be reserved for the bed and
 current of the Nile, the largest river that flows into that sea. And
 with it are grouped all its tributaries, which at first fell into
 the sea; as may be seen with the Po and its tributaries, which first
 fell into that sea, which between the Appenines and the German Alps
 was united to the Adriatic sea.

 That the Gallic Alps are the highest part of Europe.
