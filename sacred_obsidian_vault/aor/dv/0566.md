 space, because as white has no colour of its own, it is tinged and
 altered in some degree by the colour of the objects surrounding it.

 <p>a woman dressed in white in the midst of a landscape,
 that side which is towards the sun is bright in colour, so much so
 that in some portions it will dazzle the eyes like the sun itself;
 and the side which is towards the atmosphere,--luminous through
 being interwoven with the sun's rays and penetrated by them--since
 the atmosphere itself is blue, that side of the woman's figure will
 appear steeped in blue. If the surface of the ground about her be
 meadows and if she be standing between a field lighted up by the sun
 and the sun itself, you will see every portion of those folds which
 are towards the meadow tinged by the reflected rays with the colour
 of that meadow. Thus the white is transmuted into the colours of the
 luminous and of the non-luminous objects near it.
