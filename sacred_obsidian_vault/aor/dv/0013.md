 Among all the studies of natural causes and reasons Light chiefly
 delights the beholder; and among the great features of Mathematics
 </p><p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 16</font></a></p>
 <p>the certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently (tends to)
 elevate the mind of the investigator. Perspective, therefore, must
 be preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning. In
 this branch [of science] the beam of light is explained on those
 methods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of
 Mathematics as of Physics and are graced with the flowers of both

 . But its axioms being laid
 down at great length, I shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity,
 arranging them on the method both of their natural order and of
 mathematical demonstration; sometimes by deduction of the effects
 from the causes, and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects;
 adding also to my own conclusions some which, though not included in
 them, may nevertheless be inferred from them. Thus, if the Lord--who
 is the light of all things--vouchsafe to enlighten me, I will treat
 of Light; wherefore I will divide the present work into 3 Parts

 <p><a name="fn_15"></a><a href="0013.htm#fr_15">16:13</a> : 5. Such of Leonardo's notes on Optics or on Perspective
 as bear exclusively on Mathematics or Physics could not be included
 in the arrangement of the <i>libro di pittura</i> which is here presented
 to the reader. They are however but few.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_16"></a><a href="0013.htm#fr_16">16:14</a> : 10. In the middle ages--for instance, by ROGER BACON, by
 VITELLONE, with whose works Leonardo was certainly familiar, and by
 all the writers of the Renaissance Perspective and Optics were not
 regarded as distinct sciences. Perspective, indeed, is in its widest
 application the science of seeing. Although to Leonardo the two
 sciences were clearly separate, it is not so as to their names; thus
 we find axioms in Optics under the heading Perspective. According to
 this arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the
 <i>libro di pittura</i> propositions in Perspective and in Optics stand
 side by side or occur alternately. Although this particular chapter
 deals only with Optics, it is not improbable that the words <i>partirò
 la presente opera in 3 parti</i> may refer to the same division into
 three sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17.</p>
