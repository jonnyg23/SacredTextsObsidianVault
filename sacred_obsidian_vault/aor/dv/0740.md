 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF LUTING THE FURNACE WITHIN.</h3>
 <p>
 The furnace must be luted before you put the metal in it, with earth
 from Valenza, and over that with ashes.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF RESTORING THE METAL WHEN IT IS BECOMING COOL.</h3>
 <p>
 When you see that the bronze is congealing take some willow-wood cut
 in small chips and make up the fire with it.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE CAUSE OF ITS CURDLING.</h3>
 <p>
 I say that the cause of this congealing often proceeds from too much
 fire, or from ill-dried wood.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TO KNOW THE CONDITION OF THE FIRE.</h3>
 <p>
 You may know when the fire is good and fit for your purpose by a
 clear flame,
 </p><p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 24</font></a></p>
 <p>and if you see the tips of the flames dull and ending
 in much smoke do not trust it, and particularly when the flux metal
 is almost fluid.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF ALLOYING THE METAL.</h3>
 <p>
 Metal for guns must invariably be made with 6 or even 8 per cent,
 that is 6 of tin to one hundred of copper, for the less you put in,
 the stronger will the gun be.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHEN THE TIN SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE COPPER.</h3>
 <p>
 The tin should be put in with the copper when the copper is reduced
 to a fluid.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW TO HASTEN THE MELTING.</h3>
 <p>
 You can hasten the melting when 2/3ds of the copper is fluid; you
 can then, with a stick of chestnut-wood, repeatedly stir what of
 copper remains entire amidst what is melted.
