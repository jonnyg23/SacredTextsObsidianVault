 <p>
 We find among Leonardo's studies several sketches for churches on
 the plan of the Latin cross; we shall begin by describing them, and
 shall add a few observations.

 <a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</a> No. 2. (MS. B. 11b.) Plan of Santo Spirito at Florence, a
 basilica built after the designs of Brunellesco.--Leonardo has added
 the indication of a portico in front, either his own invention or
 the reproduction of a now lost design.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl095.htm#img_pl095">Pl. XCV</a> No. 2. Plan accompanied by the words: "A e santo sepolcro
 di milano di sopra"(A <i>is the upper church of S. Sepolcro at Milan);
 although since Leonardo's time considerably spoilt, it is still the
 same in plan.
 </i></p><p>
 The second plan with its note: "B e la sua parte socto tera" (B <i>is
 its subterranean part [the crypt]) still corresponds with the
 present state of this part of the church as I have ascertained by
 visiting the crypt with this plan. Excepting the addition of a few
 insignificant walls, the state of this interesting part of the
 church still conforms to Leonardo's sketch; but in the Vestibolo the
 two columns near the entrance of the winding stairs are absent.

 PL. XCV No. 1. Plan of a church evidently suggested by that of San
 Sepolcro at Milan. The central part has been added to on the
 principle of the second type of Group III. Leonardo has placed the
 "coro" <i>(choir) in the centre.</i>

 <p><i><a href="pl096.htm#img_pl096">Pl. XCVI</a> No. 2. In the plan the dome, as regards its interior,
 belongs to the First Class of Group IV, and may be grouped with the
 one in MS. B. 35a. The nave seems to be a development of the type
 represented in <a href="pl095.htm#img_pl095">Pl. XCV</a> No. 2, B. by adding towers and two lateral
 porticos</i> <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">378</font></a>
