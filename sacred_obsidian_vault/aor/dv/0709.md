 Sculptured figures which appear in motion, will, in their standing
 position, actually look as if they were falling forward.

 <p><a name="fn_0"></a><a href="0709.htm#fr_0">10:334</a> : <i>figure di rilievo</i>. Leonardo applies this term
 exclusively to wholly detached figures, especially to those standing
 free. This note apparently refers to some particular case, though we
 have no knowledge of what that may have been. If we suppose it to
 refer to the first model of the equestrian statue of Francesco
 Sforza (see the introduction to the notes on Sculpture) this
 observation may be regarded as one of his arguments for abandoning
 the first scheme of the Sforza Monument, in which the horse was to
 be galloping (see page 2). It is also in favour of this theory that
 the note is written in a manuscript volume already completed in
 1492. Leonardo's opinions as to the shortcomings of plastic works
 when compared with paintings are given under No. 655 and 656.</p>
