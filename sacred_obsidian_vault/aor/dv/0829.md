 The eyes of all animals have their pupils adapted to dilate and
 diminish of their own accord in proportion to the greater or less
 light of the sun or other luminary. But in birds the variation is
 much greater; and particularly in nocturnal birds, such as horned
 owls, and in the eyes of one species of owl; in these the pupil
 dilates in such away as to occupy nearly the whole eye, or
 diminishes to the size of a grain of millet, and always preserves
 the circular form. But in the Lion tribe, as panthers, pards,
 ounces, tigers, lynxes, Spanish cats and other similar animals the
 pupil diminishes from the perfect circle to the figure of a pointed
 oval such as is shown in the margin. But man having a weaker sight
 than any other animal is less hurt by a very strong light and his
 pupil increases but little in dark places; but in the eyes of these
 nocturnal animals, the horned owl--a bird which is the largest of
 all nocturnal birds--the power of vision increases so much that in
 the faintest nocturnal light (which we call darkness) it sees

 <p>with much more distinctness than we do in the splendour of noon day, at
 which time these birds remain hidden in dark holes; or if indeed
 they are compelled to come out into the open air lighted up by the
 sun, they contract their pupils so much that their power of sight
 diminishes together with the quantity of light admitted.

 Study the anatomy of various eyes and see which are the muscles
 which open and close the said pupils of the eyes of animals.
