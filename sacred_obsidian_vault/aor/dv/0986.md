 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Doubts about the deluge.</font></span>Here a doubt arises, and that is: whether the deluge, which happened
 at the time of Noah, was universal or not. And it would
 </p><p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>
 <p>seem not, for the reasons now to be given: We have it in the Bible that this
 deluge lasted 40 days and 40 nights of incessant and universal rain,
 and that this rain rose to ten cubits above the highest mountains in
 the world. And if it had been that the rain was universal, it would
 have covered our globe which is spherical in form. And this
 spherical surface is equally distant in every part, from the centre
 of its sphere; hence the sphere of the waters being under the same
 conditions, it is impossible that the water upon it should move,
 because water, in itself, does not move unless it falls; therefore
 how could the waters of such a deluge depart, if it is proved that
 it has no motion? and if it departed how could it move unless it
 went upwards? Here, then, natural reasons are wanting; hence to
 remove this doubt it is necessary to call in a miracle to aid us, or
 else to say that all this water was evaporated by the heat of the
 sun.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_186"></a><a href="0986.htm#fr_186">209:520</a> : The passages, here given from the MS. Leic., have
 hitherto remained unknown. Some preliminary notes on the subject are
 to be found in MS. F 80<sup>a</sup> and 80<sup>b</sup>; but as compared with the fuller
 treatment here given, they are, it seems to me, of secondary
 interest. They contain nothing that is not repeated here more
 clearly and fully. LIBRI, <i>Histoire des Sciences mathematiques III</i>,
 pages 218--221, has printed the text of F 80<sup>a</sup> and 80<sup>b</sup>, therefore it
 seemed desirable to give my reasons for not inserting it in this
 work.</p>
