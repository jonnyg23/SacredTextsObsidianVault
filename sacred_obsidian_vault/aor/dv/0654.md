 And if the poet gratifies the sense by means of the ear, the painter
 does so by the eye--the worthier sense; but I will say no more of
 this but that, if a good painter represents the fury of a battle,
 and if a poet describes one, and they are both together put before
 the public, you will see where most of the spectators will stop, to
 which they will pay most attention, on which they will bestow most
 praise, and which will satisfy them best. Undoubtedly painting being
 by a long way the more intelligible and beautiful,

 <p>will please most.
 Write up the name of God [Christ] in some spot and setup His image
 opposite and you will see which will be most reverenced. Painting
 comprehends in itself all the forms of nature, while you have
 nothing but words, which are not universal as form is, and if you
 have the effects of the representation, we have the representation
 of the effects. Take a poet who describes the beauty of a lady to
 her lover and a painter who represents her and you will see to which
 nature guides the enamoured critic. Certainly the proof should be
 allowed to rest on the verdict of experience. You have ranked
 painting among the mechanical arts but, in truth, if painters were
 as apt at praising their own works in writing as you are, it would
 not lie under the stigma of so base a name. If you call it
 mechanical because it is, in the first place, manual, and that it is
 the hand which produces what is to be found in the imagination, you
 too writers, who set down manually with the pen what is devised in
 your mind. And if you say it is mechanical because it is done for
 money, who falls into this error--if error it can be called--more
 than you? If you lecture in the schools do you not go to whoever
 pays you most? Do you do any work without pay? Still, I do not say
 this as blaming such views, for every form of labour looks for its
 reward. And if a poet should say: "I will invent a fiction with a
 great purpose," the painter can do the same, as Apelles painted
 Calumny. If you were to say that poetry is more eternal, I say the
 works of a coppersmith are more eternal still, for time preserves
 them longer than your works or ours; nevertheless they have not much
 imagination [29]. And a picture, if painted on copper with enamel
 colours may be yet more permanent. We, by our arts may be called the
 grandsons of God. If poetry deals with moral philosophy, painting
 deals with natural philosophy. Poetry describes the action of the
 mind, painting considers what the mind may effect by the motions [of
 the body]. If poetry can terrify people by hideous fictions,
 painting can do as much by depicting the same things in action.
 Supposing that a poet applies himself to represent beauty, ferocity,
 or a base, a foul
 </p><p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>
 <p>or a monstrous thing, as against a painter, he may
 in his ways bring forth a variety of forms; but will the painter not
 satisfy more? are there not pictures to be seen, so like the actual
 things, that they deceive men and animals?
