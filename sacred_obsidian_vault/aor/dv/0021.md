 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The function of the eye (21-23).</font></span>Behold here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our
 forefathers, the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and
 Life are--which are beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at
 any time be clearly known and proved by experience, remained for
 many ages unknown or falsely understood. The eye, whose function we
 so certainly know by experience, has, down to my own time, been
 defined by an infinite number of authors as one thing; but I find,
 by experience, that it is quite another.  <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">18</font></a>

 <p><a name="fn_20"></a><a href="0021.htm#fr_20">19:18</a>  13: Compare the
 note to No. 70.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_21"></a><a href="0021.htm#fr_21">19:19</a> : In section 13 we already find it indicated that the study
 of Perspective and of Optics is to be based on that of the functions
 of the eye. Leonardo also refers to the science of the eye, in his
 astronomical researches, for instance in MS. F 25b '<i>Ordine del
 provare la terra essere una stella: Imprima difinisce l'occhio'</i>,
 &amp;c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The principles of astronomical
 perspective.</p>
