 <p>
 The light must be arranged in accordance with the natural conditions
 under which you wish to represent your figures: that is, if you
 represent them in the sunshine make the shadows dark with large
 spaces of light, and mark their shadows and those of all the
 surrounding objects strongly on the ground. And if you represent
 them as in dull weather give little difference of light and shade,
 without any shadows at their feet. If you represent them as within
 doors, make a strong difference between the lights and shadows, with
 shadows on the ground. If the window is screened and the walls
 white, there will be little difference of light. If it is lighted by
 firelight make the high lights ruddy and strong, and the shadows
 dark, and those cast on the walls and on the floor will be clearly
 defined and the farther they are from the body the broader and
 longer will they be. If the light is partly from the fire and partly
 from the outer day, that of day will be the stronger and that of the
 fire almost as red as fire itself. Above all see that the figures
 you paint are broadly lighted and from above, that is to say all
 living persons that you paint; for you will see that all the people
 you meet out in the street are lighted from above, and you must know
 that if you saw your most intimate friend with a light [on his face]
 from below you would find it difficult to recognise him.
