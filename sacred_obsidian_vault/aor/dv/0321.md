 The nose will make a double square; that is the width of the nose at
 the nostrils goes twice into the length from the tip of the nose to
 the eyebrows. And, in the same way, in profile the distance from the
 extreme side of the nostril where it joins the cheek to the tip of
 the nose is equal to the width of the nose in front from one nostril
 to the other. If you divide the whole length of the nose--that is
 from the tip to the insertion of the eyebrows, into 4 equal parts,
 you will find that one of these parts extends from the tip of the
 nostrils to the base of the nose, and the upper division lies
 between the inner corner of the eye and the insertion of the
 eyebrows; and the two middle parts [together] are equal to the
 length of the eye from the inner to the outer corner.
