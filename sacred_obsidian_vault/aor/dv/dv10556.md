 <i>It is hardly necessary to offer any excuses for the division
 carried out in the arrangement of the text into practical
 suggestions and theoretical enquiries. It was evidently intended by
 Leonardo himself as we conclude from incidental remarks in the MSS.
 (for instance No</i> 110<i>). The fact that this arrangement was never
 carried out either in the old MS. copies or in any edition since, is
 easily accounted for by the general disorder which results from the
 provisional distribution of the various chapters in the old copies.
 We have every reason to believe that the earliest copyists, in
 distributing the materials collected by them, did not in the least
 consider the order in which the original MS.lay before them.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>It is evident that almost all the chapters which refer to the
 calling and life of the painter--and which are here brought together
 in the first section (Nos.</i> 482-508<i>)--may be referred to two
 distinct periods in Leonardo's life; most of them can be dated as
 belonging to the year</i> 1492 <i>or to</i> 1515. <i>At about this later time
 Leonardo may have formed the project of completing his Libro della
 Pittura, after an interval of some years, as it would seem, during
 which his interest in the subject had fallen somewhat into the
 background.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>In the second section, which treats first of the artist's studio,
 the construction of a suitable window forms the object of careful
 investigations; the special importance attached to this by Leonardo
 is sufficiently obvious. His theory of the incidence of light which
 was fully discussed in a former part of this work, was to him by no
 means of mere abstract value, but, being deduced, as he says, from
 experience (or experiment) was required to prove its utility in
 practice. Connected with this we find suggestions for the choice of
 a light with practical hints as to sketching a picture and some
 other precepts of a practical character which must come under
 consideration in the course of completing the painting. In all this
 I have followed the same principle of arrangement in the text as was
 carried out in the Theory of Painting, thus the suggestions for the
 Perspective of a picture, (Nos.</i> 536-569<i>), are followed by the
 theory of light and shade for the practical method of optics (Nos.</i>
 548--566<i>) and this by the practical precepts or the treatment of
 aerial perspective (</i>567--570<i>).</i>

 <i>In the passage on Portrait and Figure Painting the principles of
 painting as applied to a bust and head are separated and placed
 first, since the advice to figure painters must have some connection
 with the principles of the treatment of composition by which they
 are followed.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>But this arrangement of the text made it seem advisable not to pick
 out the practical precepts as to the representation of trees and
 landscape from the close connection in which they were originally
 placed--unlike the rest of the practical precepts--with the theory
 of this branch of the subject. They must therefore be sought under
 the section entitled Botany for Painters.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>As a supplement to the</i> Libro di Pittura <i>I have here added those
 texts which treat of the Painter's materials,--as chalk, drawing
 paper, colours and their preparation, of the management of oils and
 varnishes; in the appendix are some notes on chemical substances.
 Possibly some of these, if not all, may have stood in connection
 with the preparation of colours. It is in the very nature of things
 that Leonardo's incidental indications as to colours and the like
 should be now-a-days extremely obscure and could only be explained
 by professional experts--by them even in but few instances. It might
 therefore have seemed advisable to reproduce exactly the original
 text without offering any translation. The rendering here given is
 merely an attempt to suggest what Leonardo's meaning may have been.</i>

 <i>LOMAZZO tells us in his</i> Trattato dell'arte della Pittura, Scultura
 ed Architettura (Milano 1584, libro II, Cap. XIV): "Va discorrendo
 ed argomentando Leonardo Vinci in un suo libro letto da me (?)
 questi anni passati, ch'egli scrisse di mano stanca ai prieghi di
 LUDOVICO SFORZA duca di Milano, in determinazione di questa
 questione, se e piu nobile la pittura o la scultura; dicendo che
 quanto piu un'arte porta seco fatica di corpo, e sudore, tanto piu e
 vile, e men pregiata". <i>But the existence of any book specially
 written for Lodovico il Moro on the superiority of Painting over
 sculpture is perhaps mythical. The various passages in praise of
 Painting as compared not merely with Sculpture but with Poetry, are
 scattered among MSS. of very different dates.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Besides, the way, in which the subject is discussed appears not to
 support the supposition, that these texts were prepared at a special
 request of the Duke.</i>
