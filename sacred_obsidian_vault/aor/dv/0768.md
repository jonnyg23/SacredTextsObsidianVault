 <i><a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a> No. 6 (MS. Ash. II 6b) contains a small sketch of a
 capital with the following note, written in three lines:</i> I chorni
 del capitelo deono essere la quarta parte d'uno quadro <i>(The horns
 of a capital must measure the fourth part of a square).</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>MS. S. K. M. III 72b contains two sketches of ornamentations of
 windows.</i>

 <i>In MS. C. A. 308a; 938a (see <a href="pl082.htm#img_pl082">Pl. LXXXII</a> No. 1) there are several
 sketches of columns. One of the two columns on the right is similar
 to those employed by Bramante at the Canonica di S. Ambrogio. The
 same columns appear in the sketch underneath the plan of a castle.
 There they appear coupled, and in two stories one above the other.
 The archivolls which seem to spring out of the columns, are shaped
 like twisted cords, meant perhaps to be twisted branches. The walls
 between the columns seem to be formed out of blocks of wood, the
 pedestals are ornamented with a reticulated pattern. From all this
 we may suppose that Leonardo here had in mind either some festive
 decoration, or perhaps a pavilion for some hunting place or park.
 The sketch of columns marked "35" gives an example of columns shaped
 like candelabra, a form often employed at that time, particularly in
 Milan, and the surrounding districts for instance in the Cortile di
 Casa Castiglione now Silvestre, in the cathedral of Como, at Porta
 della Rana &amp;c</i>
