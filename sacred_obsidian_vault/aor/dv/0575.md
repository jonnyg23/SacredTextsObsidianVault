 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE PROOF AND REASON WHY AMONG THE ILLUMINATED PARTS CERTAIN PORTIONS ARE IN HIGHER LIGHT THAN OTHERS.</h3>
 <p>
 Since it is proved that every definite light is, or seems to be,
 derived from one single
 </p><p><a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 290</font></a></p>
 <p>point the side illuminated by it will have
 its highest light on the portion where the line of radiance falls
 perpendicularly; as is shown above in the lines <i>a g</i>, and also in
 <i>a h</i> and in <i>l a</i>; and that portion of the illuminated side will be
 least luminous, where the line of incidence strikes it between two
 more dissimilar angles, as is seen at <i>b c d</i>. And by this means you
 may also know which parts are deprived of light as is seen at <i>m k</i>.
 </p><p>
 Where the angles made by the lines of incidence are most equal there
 will be the highest light, and where they are most unequal it will
 be darkest.
 </p><p>
 I will make further mention of the reason of reflections.

 right hand side. The small circles above the beginning of lines 5
 and 11 as well as the circle above the text on <a href="pl031.htm#img_pl031">Pl. XXXI</a>, are in a
 paler ink and evidently added by a later hand in order to
 distinguish the text as belonging to the <i>Libro di Pittura</i> (see
 Prolegomena. No. 12, p. 3). The text on the left hand side of this
 page is given as Nos. 577 and 137.</p>
