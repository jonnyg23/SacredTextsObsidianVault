 That portion of a tree which is farthest from the force which
 strikes it is the most injured by the blow because it bears most
 strain; thus nature has foreseen this case by thickening them in
 that part where they can be most hurt; and most in such trees as
 grow to great heights, as pines and the like.  <a name="fr_230"></a><a href="#fn_230"><font size="1">228</font></a>

 <p><a name="fn_230"></a><a href="0473.htm#fr_230">237:228</a> : Compare the
 sketch drawn with a pen and washed with Indian ink on <a href="pl040.htm#img_pl040">Pl. XL</a>, No. 1.
 In the Vatican copy we find, under a section entitled '<i>del fumo</i>',
 the following remark: <i>Era sotto di questo capitulo un rompimento di
 montagna, per dentro delle quali roture scherzaua fiame di fuoco,
 disegnate di penna et ombrate d'acquarella, da uedere cosa mirabile
 et uiua</i> (Ed. MANZI, p. 235. Ed. LUDWIG, Vol. I, 460). This appears
 to refer to the left hand portion of the drawing here given from the
 Windsor collection, and from this it must be inferred, that the leaf
 as it now exists in the library of the Queen of England, was already
 separated from the original MS. at the time when the Vatican copy
 was made.</p>
