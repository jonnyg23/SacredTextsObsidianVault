 In all the proportions I lay down it must be understood that the
 medium between the bodies is always the same. [2] The smaller the
 luminous body the more distinct will the transmission of the shadows
 be.

 [3] When of two opposite shadows, produced by the same body, one is
 twice as dark as the other though similar in form, one of the two
 lights causing them must have twice the diameter that the other has
 and be at twice the distance from the opaque body. If the object is
 lowly moved across the luminous body, and the shadow is intercepted
 at some distance from the object, there will be the same relative
 proportion between the motion of the derived shadow and the motion
 of the primary shadow, as between the distance from the object to
 the light, and that from the object to the spot where the shadow is
 intercepted; so that though the object is moved slowly the shadow
 moves fast.
