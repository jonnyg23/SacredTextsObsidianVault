 A sick man finding himself in <i>articulo mortis</i> heard a knock at the
 door, and asking one of his servants who was knocking, the servant
 went out, and answered that it was a woman calling herself Madonna
 Bona. Then the sick man lifting his arms to Heaven thanked God with
 a loud voice, and told the servants that they were to let her come
 in at once, so that he might see one good woman before he died,
 since in all his life he had never yet seen one.
