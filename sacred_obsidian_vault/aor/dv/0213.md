 <p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="0213.htm#fr_103">118:101</a> : In this and the following chapters of MS. C the order of
 the original paging has been adhered to, and is shown in
 parenthesis. Leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject
 of these propositions. The space left for the purpose has
 occasionally been made use of for quite different matter. Even the
 numerous diagrams, most of them very delicately sketched, lettered
 and numbered, which occur on these pages, are hardly ever explained,
 with the exception of those few which are here given.</p>
