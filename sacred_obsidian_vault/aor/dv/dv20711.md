 <i>When we consider how superficial and imperfect are the accounts of
 Leonardo's life written some time after his death by Vasari and
 others, any notes or letters which can throw more light on his
 personal circumstances cannot fail to be in the highest degree
 interesting. The texts here given as Nos.</i> 1351--1353, <i>set his
 residence in Rome in quite a new aspect; nay, the picture which
 irresistibly dwells in our minds after reading these details of his
 life in the Vatican, forms a striking contrast to the contemporary
 life of Raphael at Rome.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>I have placed foremost of these documents the very remarkable
 letters to the Defterdar of Syria. In these Leonardo speaks of
 himself as having staid among the mountains of Armenia, and as the
 biographies of the master tell nothing of any such distant journeys,
 it would seem most obvious to treat this passage as fiction, and so
 spare ourselves the onus of proof and discussion. But on close
 examination no one can doubt that these documents, with the
 accompanying sketches, are the work of Leonardo's own hand. Not
 merely is the character of the handwriting his, but the spelling and
 the language are his also. In one respect only does the writing
 betray any marked deviation from the rest of the notes, especially
 those treating on scientific questions; namely, in these
 observations he seems to have taken particular pains to give the
 most distinct and best form of expression to all he had to say; we
 find erasures and emendations in almost every line. He proceeded, as
 we shall see, in the same way in the sketches for letters to
 Giuliano de' Medici, and what can be more natural, I may ask, than
 to find the draft of a letter thus altered and improved when it is
 to contain an account of a definite subject, and when personal
 interests are in the scale? The finished copies as sent off are not
 known to exist; if we had these instead of the rough drafts, we
 might unhesitatingly</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 382</font></a></p>
 <p><i>have declared that some unknown Italian
 engineer must have been, at that time, engaged in Armenia in the
 service of the Egyptian Sultan, and that Leonardo had copied his
 documents. Under this hypothesis however we should have to state
 that this unknown writer must have been so far one in mind with
 Leonardo as to use the same style of language and even the same
 lines of thought. This explanation might--as I say--have been
 possible, if only we had the finished letters. But why should these
 rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they
 actually and obviously are? If Leonardo had been a man of our own
 time, we might perhaps have attempted to account for the facts by
 saying that Leonardo, without having been in the East himself, might
 have undertaken to write a Romance of which the scene was laid in
 Armenia, and at the desire of his publisher had made sketches of
 landscape to illustrate the text.
 </i></p><p>
 I feel bound to mention this singular hypothesis as it has actually
 been put forward (see No. 1336 note 5); and it would certainly seem
 as though there were no other possible way of evading the conclusion
 to which these letters point, and their bearing on the life of the
 master,--absurd as the alternative is. But, if, on a question of
 such importance, we are justified in suggesting theories that have
 no foundation in probability, I could suggest another which, as
 compared with that of a Fiction by Leonardo, would be neither more
 nor less plausible; it is, moreover the only other hypothesis,
 perhaps, which can be devised to account for these passages, if it
 were possible to prove that the interpretation that the documents
 themselves suggest, must be rejected a priori; viz may not Leonardo
 have written them with the intention of mystifying those who, after
 his death, should try to decipher these manuscripts with a view to
 publishing them? But if, in fact, no objection that will stand the
 test of criticism can be brought against the simple and direct
 interpretation of the words as they stand, we are bound to regard
 Leonardo's travels in the East as an established fact. There is, I
 believe nothing in what we know of his biography to negative such a
 fact, especially as the details of his life for some few years are
 wholly unknown; nor need we be at a loss for evidence which may
 serve to explain--at any rate to some extent--the strangeness of his
 undertaking such a journey. We have no information as to Leonardo's
 history between 1482 and 1486; it cannot be proved that he was
 either in Milan or in Florence. On the other hand the tenor of this
 letter does not require us to assume a longer absence than a year or
 two. For, even if his appointment (offitio) <i>as Engineer in Syria
 had been a permanent one, it might have become untenable--by the
 death perhaps of the Defterdar, his patron, or by his removal from
 office--, and Leonardo on his return home may have kept silence on
 the subject of an episode which probably had ended in failure and
 disappointment.
 </i></p><p>
 From the text of No. 1379 we can hardly doubt that Leonardo intended
 to make an excursion secretly from Rome to Naples, although so far
 as has hitherto been known, his biographers never allude to it. In
 another place (No. 1077) he says that he had worked as an Engineer
 in Friuli. Are we to doubt this statement too, merely because no
 biographer has hitherto given us any information on the matter? In
 the geographical notes Leonardo frequently speaks of the East, and
 though such passages
 </p><p><a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a></p>
 <p><i>afford no direct proof of his having been
 there, they show beyond a doubt that, next to the Nile, the
 Euphrates, the Tigris and the Taurus mountains had a special
 interest in his eyes. As a still further proof of the futility of
 the argument that there is nothing in his drawings to show that he
 had travelled in the East, we find on <a href="pl120.htm#img_pl120">Pl. CXX</a> a study of oriental
 heads of Armenian type,--though of course this may have been made in
 Italy.
 </i></p><p>
 If the style of these letters were less sober, and the expressions
 less strictly to the point throughout, it miglit be possible to
 regard them as a romantic fiction instead of a narrative of fact.
 Nay, we have only to compare them with such obviously fanciful
 passages as No. 1354, Nos. 670-673, and the Fables and Prophecies.
 It is unnecessary to discuss the subject any further here; such
 explanations as the letter needs are given in the foot notes.
 </p><p>
 The drafts of letters to Lodovico il Moro are very remarkable.
 Leonardo and this prince were certainly far less closely connected,
 than has hitherto been supposed. It is impossible that Leonardo can
 have remained so long in the service of this prince, because the
 salary was good, as is commonly stated. On the contrary, it would
 seem, that what kept him there, in spite of his sore need of the
 money owed him by the prince, was the hope of some day being able to
 carry out the project of casting the 'gran cavallo'.
