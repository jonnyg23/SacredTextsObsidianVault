 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Theory of the elevation of water within the mountains.</font></span>Where there is life there is heat, and where vital heat is, there is
 movement of vapour. This is proved, inasmuch as we see that the
 element of fire by its heat always draws to itself damp vapours and
 thick mists as opaque clouds, which it raises from seas as well as
 lakes and rivers and damp valleys; and these being drawn by degrees
 as far as the cold region, the first portion stops, because heat and
 moisture cannot exist with cold and dryness; and where the first
 portion stops the rest settle, and thus one portion after another
 being added, thick and dark clouds are formed. They are often wafted
 about and borne by the winds from one region to another, where by
 their density they become so heavy that they fall in thick rain; and
 if the heat of the sun is added to the power of the element of fire,
 the clouds are drawn up higher still and find a greater degree of
 cold, in which they form ice and fall in storms of hail. Now the
 same heat which holds up so great a weight of water as is seen to
 rain from the clouds, draws them from below upwards, from the foot
 of the mountains, and leads and holds them within the summits of the
 mountains, and these, finding some fissure, issue continuously and
 cause rivers.
