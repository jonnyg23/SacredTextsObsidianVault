 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light (30-39).</font></span>The eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body
 better than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is
 in itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot
 be distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot
 be seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and
 gives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual
 darkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.
