 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.</h3>
 <p>
 Painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which
 are:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,
 Distance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine
 will be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the
 painter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to
 imitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.
