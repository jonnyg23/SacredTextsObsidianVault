 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF SPRINGS OF WATER ON THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.</h3>
 <p>
 It is quite evident that the whole surface of the ocean--when there
 is no storm--is at an equal distance from the centre of the earth,
 and that the tops of the mountains are farther from this centre in
 proportion as they rise above the surface of that sea; therefore if
 the body of the earth were not like that of man, it would be
 impossible that the waters of the sea--being so much lower than the
 mountains--could by their nature rise up to the summits of these
 mountains. Hence it is to be believed that the same cause which
 keeps the blood at the top of the head in man keeps the water at the
 summits of the mountains.

 <p><a name="fn_176"></a><a href="0967.htm#fr_176">198:510</a> : This conception of the rising of the blood, which has
 given rise to the comparison, was recognised as erroneous by
 Leonardo himself at a later period. It must be remembered that the
 MS. A, from which these passages are taken, was written about twenty
 years earlier than the MS. Leic. (Nos. 963 and 849) and twenty-five
 years before the MS. W. An. IV.

 There is, in the original a sketch with No. 968 which is not
 reproduced. It represents a hill of the same shape as that shown at
 No. 982. There are veins, or branched streams, on the side of the
 hill, like those on the skull <a href="pl108.htm#img_pl108">Pl. CVIII</a>, No. 4</p>
