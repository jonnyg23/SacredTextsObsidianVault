 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The rules of aerial perspective (295--297).</font></span>There is another kind of perspective which I call Aerial
 Perspective, because by the atmosphere we are able to distinguish
 the variations in distance of different buildings, which appear
 placed on a single line; as, for instance, when we see several
 buildings beyond a wall, all of which, as they appear above the top
 of the wall, look of the same size, while you wish to represent them
 in a picture as more remote one than another and to give the effect
 of a somewhat dense atmosphere. You know that in an atmosphere of
 equal density the remotest objects seen through it, as mountains, in
 consequence of the great quantity of atmosphere between your eye and
 them--appear blue and almost of the same hue as the atmosphere
 itself  <a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_130"><font size="1">128</font></a>
  when the
 sun is in the East  <a name="fr_131"></a><a href="#fn_131"><font size="1">129</font></a>
 . Hence you must
 make the nearest building above the wall of its real colour, but the
 more distant ones make less defined and bluer. Those you wish should
 look farthest away you must make proportionately bluer; thus, if one
 is to be five times as distant, make it five times bluer. And by
 this rule the buildings which above a [given] line appear of the
 same size, will plainly be distinguished as to which are the more
 remote and which larger than the others.

 in the East). Apparently the author refers here to morning light in
 general. H. LUDWIG however translates this passage from the Vatican
 copy "<i>wenn namlich die Sonne (dahinter) im Osten steht</i>".</p>
