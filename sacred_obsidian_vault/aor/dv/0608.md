 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE DELUGE AND HOW TO REPRESENT IT IN A PICTURE.</h3>
 <p>
 Let the dark and gloomy air be seen buffeted by the rush of contrary
 winds and
 </p><p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 307</font></a></p>
 <p>dense from the continued rain mingled with hail and
 bearing hither and thither an infinite number of branches torn from
 the trees and mixed with numberless leaves. All round may be seen
 venerable trees, uprooted and stripped by the fury of the winds; and
 fragments of mountains, already scoured bare by the torrents,
 falling into those torrents and choking their valleys till the
 swollen rivers overflow and submerge the wide lowlands and their
 inhabitants. Again, you might have seen on many of the hill-tops
 terrified animals of different kinds, collected together and subdued
 to tameness, in company with men and women who had fled there with
 their children. The waters which covered the fields, with their
 waves were in great part strewn with tables, bedsteads, boats and
 various other contrivances made from necessity and the fear of
 death, on which were men and women with their children amid sounds
 of lamentation and weeping, terrified by the fury of the winds which
 with their tempestuous violence rolled the waters under and over and
 about the bodies of the drowned. Nor was there any object lighter
 than the water which was not covered with a variety of animals
 which, having come to a truce, stood together in a frightened
 crowd--among them wolves, foxes, snakes and others--fleing from
 death. And all the waters dashing on their shores seemed to be
 battling them with the blows of drowned bodies, blows which killed
 those in whom any life remained [19]. You might have
 </p><p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a></p>
 <p>seen assemblages of men who, with weapons in their hands, defended the
 small spots that remained to them against lions, wolves and beasts
 of prey who sought safety there. Ah! what dreadful noises were heard
 in the air rent by the fury of the thunder and the lightnings it
 flashed forth, which darted from the clouds dealing ruin and
 striking all that opposed its course. Ah! how many you might have
 seen closing their ears with their hands to shut out the tremendous
 sounds made in the darkened air by the raging of the winds mingling
 with the rain, the thunders of heaven and the fury of the
 thunder-bolts. Others were not content with shutting their eyes, but
 laid their hands one over the other to cover them the closer that
 they might not see the cruel slaughter of the human race by the
 wrath of God. Ah! how many laments! and how many in their terror
 flung themselves from the rocks! Huge branches of great oaks loaded
 with men were seen borne through the air by the impetuous fury of
 the winds. How many were the boats upset, some entire, and some
 broken in pieces, on the top of people labouring to escape with
 gestures and actions of grief foretelling a fearful death. Others,
 with desperate act, took their own lives, hopeless of being able to
 endure such suffering; and of these, some flung themselves from
 lofty rocks, others strangled themselves with their own hands, other
 seized their own children and violently slew them at a blow; some
 wounded and killed themselves with their own weapons; others,
 falling on their knees recommended themselves to God. Ah! how many
 mothers wept over their drowned sons, holding them upon their knees,
 with arms raised spread out towards heaven and with words and
 various threatening gestures, upbraiding the wrath of the gods.
 Others with clasped hands and fingers clenched gnawed them and
 devoured them till they bled, crouching with their breast down on
 their knees in their intense and unbearable anguish. Herds of
 animals were to be seen, such as horses, oxen, goats and swine
 already environed
 </p><p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a></p>
 <p>by the waters and left isolated on the high peaks
 of the mountains, huddled together, those in the middle climbing to
 the top and treading on the others, and fighting fiercely
 themselves; and many would die for lack of food. Already had the
 birds begun to settle on men and on other animals, finding no land
 uncovered which was not occupied by living beings, and already had
 famine, the minister of death, taken the lives of the greater number
 of the animals, when the dead bodies, now fermented, where leaving
 the depth of the waters and were rising to the top. Among the
 buffeting waves, where they were beating one against the other, and,
 like as balls full of air, rebounded from the point of concussion,
 these found a resting place on the bodies of the dead. And above
 these judgements, the air was seen covered with dark clouds, riven
 by the forked flashes of the raging bolts of heaven, lighting up on
 all sides the depth of the gloom.
 </p><p>
 The motion of the air is seen by the motion of the dust thrown up by
 the horse's running and this motion is as swift in again filling up
 the vacuum left in the air which enclosed the horse, as he is rapid
 in passing away from the air.
 </p><p>
 Perhaps it will seem to you that you may reproach me with having
 represented the currents made through the air by the motion of the
 wind notwithstanding that the wind itself is not visible in the air.
 To this I must answer that it is not the motion of the wind but only
 the motion of the things carried along by it which is seen in the
 air.

 Whirlwinds which carry water [spouts] branches of trees, and men
 through the air.

 Boughs stripped off by the winds, mingling by the meeting of the
 winds, with people upon them.

 Broken trees loaded with people.

 Ships broken to pieces, beaten on rocks.

 Flocks of sheep. Hail stones, thunderbolts, whirlwinds.

 People on trees which are unable to to support them; trees and
 rocks, towers and hills covered with people, boats, tables, troughs,
 and other means of floating. Hills covered with men, women and
 animals; and lightning from the clouds illuminating every thing.

 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="0608.htm#fr_284">309:282</a>  76: These observations, added at the bottom
 of the page containing the full description of the doluge seem to
 indicate that it was Leonardo's intention to elaborate the subject
 still farther in a separate treatise.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="0608.htm#fr_285">309:283</a>  81: <i>Spianamenti di citta</i> (overthrow
 of cities). A considerable number of drawings in black chalk, at
 Windsor, illustrate this catastrophe. Most of them are much rubbed;
 one of the least injured is reproduced at <a href="pl039.htm#img_pl039">Pl. XXXIX</a>. Compare also
 the pen and ink sketch <a href="pl036.htm#img_pl036">Pl. XXXVI</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_286"></a><a href="0608.htm#fr_286">310:284</a> : This chapter, which, with the next one, is written on a
 loose sheet, seems to be the passage to which one of the compilers
 of the Vatican copy alluded when he wrote on the margin of fol. 36:
 "<i>Qua mi ricordo della mirabile discritione del Diluuio dello
 autore.</i>" It is scarcely necessary to point out that these chapters
 are among those which have never before been published. The
 description in No. 607 may be regarded as a preliminary sketch for
 this one. As the MS. G. (in which it is to be found) must be
 attributed to the period of about 1515 we may deduce from it the
 approximate date of the drawings on <a href="pl034.htm#img_pl034">Pl. XXXIV</a>, <a href="pl035.htm#img_pl035">XXXV</a>, Nos. 2 and 3,
 <a href="pl036.htm#img_pl036">XXXVI</a> and <a href="pl037.htm#img_pl037">XXXVII</a>, since they obviously belong to this text. The
 drawings No. 2 on <a href="pl035.htm#img_pl035">Pl. XXXV</a> are, in the original, side by side with
 the text of No. 608; lines 57 to 76 are shown in the facsimile. In
 the drawing in Indian ink given on <a href="pl034.htm#img_pl034">Pl. XXXIV</a> we see Wind-gods in the
 sky, corresponding to the allusion to Aeolus in No. 607 1.
 15.-Plates XXXVI and <a href="pl037.htm#img_pl037">XXXVII</a> form one sheet in the original. The
 texts reproduced on these Plates have however no connection with the
 sketches, excepting the sketches of clouds on the right hand side.
 These texts are given as No. 477. The group of small figures on <a href="pl037.htm#img_pl037">Pl. XXXVII</a>, to the left, seems to be intended for a '<i>congregatione
 d'uomini.</i>' See No. 608, 1. 19.</p>
