 <p>
 The first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should
 appear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different
 distances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground
 of the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are:
 the diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the
 diminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour.
 And of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from [the
 structure of] the eye, while the other two are caused by the
 atmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen

 <p>by it. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due
 variety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like
 brothers, &amp;c.

 <p><a name="fn_19"></a><a href="0017.htm#fr_19">18:17</a> : This and the two foregoing chapters must have been
 written in 1513 to 1516. They undoubtedly indicate the scheme which
 Leonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on
 Perspective as applied to Painting. This is important because it is
 an evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG and others, that
 Leonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in one book so
 early as before 1500; a Book which, according to the hypothesis,
 must have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed possibly,
 by the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: <i>Das Buch van
 der Malerei</i>. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).</p>
