 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Plans and suggestions for the arrangement of materials (797-802).</font></span>This work must begin with the conception of man, and describe the
 nature of the womb and how the foetus lives in it, up to what stage
 it resides there, and in what way it quickens into life and feeds.
 Also its growth and what interval there is between
 </p><p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>
 <p>one stage of
 growth and another. What it is that forces it out from the body of
 the mother, and for what reasons it sometimes comes out of the
 mother's womb before the due time.
 </p><p>
 Then I will describe which are the members, which, after the boy is
 born, grow more than the others, and determine the proportions of a
 boy of one year.
 </p><p>
 Then describe the fully grown man and woman, with their proportions,
 and the nature of their complexions, colour, and physiognomy.
 </p><p>
 Then how they are composed of veins, tendons, muscles and bones.
 This I shall do at the end of the book. Then, in four drawings,
 represent four universal conditions of men. That is, Mirth, with
 various acts of laughter, and describe the cause of laughter.
 Weeping in various aspects with its causes. Contention, with various
 acts of killing; flight, fear, ferocity, boldness, murder and every
 thing pertaining to such cases. Then represent Labour, with pulling,
 thrusting, carrying, stopping, supporting and such like things.
 </p><p>
 Further I would describe attitudes and movements. Then perspective,
 concerning the functions and effects of the eye; and of
 hearing--here I will speak of music--, and treat of the other
 senses.
 </p><p>
 And then describe the nature of the senses.
 </p><p>
 This mechanism of man we will demonstrate in ... figures; of which
 the three first will show the ramification of the bones; that is:
 first one to show their height and position and shape: the second
 will be seen in profile and will show the depth of the whole and of
 the parts, and their position. The third figure will be a
 demonstration of the bones of the backparts. Then I will make three
 other figures from the same point of view, with the bones sawn
 across, in which will be shown their thickness and hollowness. Three
 other figures of the bones complete, and of the nerves which rise
 from the nape of the neck, and in what limbs they ramify. And three
 others of the bones and veins, and where they ramify. Then three
 figures with the muscles and three with the skin, and their proper
 proportions; and three of woman, to illustrate the womb and the
 menstrual veins which go to the breasts.
