 1. <i>Incominciai</i>. We have no other information as to the two
 pictures of the Madonna here spoken of. As Leonardo here tells us
 that he had begun two Madonnas at the same time, the word
 '<i>incominciai</i>' may be understood to mean that he had begun at the
 same time preparatory studies for two pictures to be painted later.
 If this is so, the non-existence of the pictures may be explained by
 supposing that they were only planned and never executed. I may here
 mention a few studies for pictures of the Madonna which probably
 belong to this early time; particularly a drawing in silver-point on
 bluish tinted paper at Windsor--see <a href="pl040.htm#img_pl040">Pl. XL</a>, No. 3--, a drawing of
 which the details have almost disappeared in the original but have
 been rendered quite distinct in the reproduction; secondly a slight
 pen and ink sketch in, the Codex VALLARDI, in the Louvre, fol. 64,
 No. 2316; again a silver point drawing of a Virgin and child drawn
 over again with the pen in the His de la Salle collection also in
 the Louvre, No. 101. (See Vicomte BOTH DE TAUZIA, <i>Notice des
 dessins de la collection His de la Salle, exposes au Louvre</i>. Paris
 1881, pp. 80, 81.) This drawing is, it is true, traditionally
 ascribed to Raphael, but the author of the catalogue very justly
 points out its great resemblance with the sketches for Madonnas in
 the British Museum which are indisputably Leonardo's. Some of these
 have been published by Mr. HENRY WALLIS in the Art Journal, New Ser.
 No. 14, Feb. 1882. If the non-existence of the two pictures here
 alluded to justifies my hypothesis that only studies for such
 pictures are meant by the text, it may also be supposed that the
 drawings were made for some comrade in VERROCCHIO'S atelier. (See
 VASARI, Sansoni's ed. Florence 1880. Vol. IV, p. 564): "<i>E perche a
 Lerenzo piaceva fuor di modo la maniera di Lionardo, la seppe cosi
 bene imitare, che niuno fu che nella pulitezza e nel finir l'opere
 con diligenza l'imitasse più di lui</i>." Leonardo's notes give me no
 opportunity of discussing the pictures executed by him in Florence,
 before he moved to Milan. So the studies for the unfinished picture
 of the Adoration of the Magi--in the Uffizi, Florence--cannot be
 described here, nor would any discussion about the picture in the
 Louvre "<i>La Vierge aux Rochers</i>" be appropriate in the absence of
 all allusion to it in the MSS. Therefore, when I presently add a few
 remarks on this painting in explanation of the Master's drawings for
 it, it will be not merely with a view to facilitate critical
 researches about the picture now in the National Gallery, London,
 which by some critics has been pronounced to be a replica of the
 Louvre picture, but also because I take this opportunity of
 publishing several finished studies of the Master's which, even if
 they were not made in Florence but later in Milan, must have been
 prior to the painting of the Last Supper. The original picture in
 Paris is at present so disfigured by dust and varnish that the
 current reproductions in photography actually give evidence more of
 the injuries to which the picture has been exposed than of the
 original work itself. The wood-cut given on p. 344, is only intended
 to give a general notion of the composition. It must be understood
 that the outline and expression of the heads, which in the picture
 is obscured but not destroyed, is here altogether missed. The
 facsimiles which follow are from drawings which appear to me to be
 studies for "<i>La Vierge aux Rochers</i>."
 </p><p>
 1. A drawing in silver point on brown toned paper of a woman's head
 looking to the left. In the Royal Library at Turin, apparently a
 study from nature for the Angel's head (<a href="pl042.htm#img_pl042">Pl. XLII</a>).
 </p><p>
 2. A study of drapery for the left leg of the same figure, done with
 the brush, Indian ink on greenish paper, the lights heightened with
 white.
 </p><p>
 The original is at Windsor, No. 223. The reproduction <a href="pl043.htm#img_pl043">Pl. XLIII</a> is
 defective in the shadow on the upper part of the thigh, which is not
 so deep as in the original; it should also be observed that the
 folds of the drapery near the hips are somewhat altered in the
 finished work in the Louvre, while the London copy shows a greater
 resemblance to this study in that particular.
 </p><p>
 3. A study in red chalk for the bust of the Infant Christ--No. 3 in
 the Windsor collection (<a href="pl044.htm#img_pl044">Pl. XLIV</a>). The well-known silver-point
 drawing on pale green paper, in the Louvre, of a boy's head (No. 363
 in REISET, <i>Notice des dessins, Ecoles d'Italie</i>) seems to me to be
 a slightly altered copy, either from the original picture or from
 this red chalk study.
 </p><p>
 4. A silver-point study on greenish paper, for the head of John the
 Baptist, reproduced on p. 342. This was formerly in the Codex
 Vallardi and is now exhibited among the drawings in the Louvre. The
 lights are, in the original, heightened with white; the outlines,
 particularly round the head and ear, are visibly restored.
 </p><p>
 There is a study of an outstretched hand--No. 288 in the Windsor
 collection--which was published in the Grosvenor Gallery
 Publication, 1878, simply under the title of: "No. 72 Study of a
 hand, pointing" which, on the other hand, I regard as a copy by a
 pupil. The action occurs in the kneeling angel of the Paris picture
 and not in the London copy.
 </p><p>
 These four genuine studies form, I believe, a valuable substitute in
 the absence of any MS. notes referring to the celebrated Paris
 picture.</p>
