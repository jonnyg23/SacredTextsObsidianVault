 <p>
 Men will deal bitter blows to that which is the cause of their life.
 (In thrashing Grain.)
 </p><p>
 The skins of animals will rouse men from their silence with great
 outcries and curses. (Balls for playing Games.)
 </p><p>
 Very often a thing that is itself broken is the occasion of much
 union. (That is the Comb made of split Cane which unites the threads
 of Silk.)
 </p><p>
 The wind passing through the skins of animals will make men dance.
 (That is the Bag-pipe, which makes people dance.)
