 </p><h3 align="CENTER">INGRATITUDE.</h3>
 <p>
 Pigeons are a symbol of ingratitude; for when they are old enough no
 longer to need to be fed, they begin to fight with their father, and
 this struggle does not end until the young one drives the father out
 and takes the hen and makes her his own.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">CRUELTY.</h3>
 <p>
 The basilisk is so utterly cruel that when it cannot kill animals by
 its baleful gaze, it turns upon herbs and plants, and fixing its
 gaze on them withers them up.
