 curvature, obliquity, flatness or, in short, any character I may be
 able to detect in them.]

 Shadow is the obstruction of light. Shadows appear to me to be of
 supreme importance in perspective, because, without them opaque and
 solid bodies will be ill defined; that which is contained within
 their outlines and their boundaries themselves will be
 ill-understood unless they are shown against a background of a
 different tone from themselves. And therefore in my first
 proposition concerning shadow I state that every opaque body is
 surrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light. And
 on this proposition I build up the first Book. Besides this, shadows
 have in themselves various degrees of darkness, because they are
 caused by the absence of a variable amount of the luminous rays; and
 these I call Primary shadows because they are the first, and
 inseparable from the object to which they belong. And on

 <p>this I will
 found my second Book. From these primary shadows there result
 certain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and
 these vary in character according to that of the primary shadows
 whence they are derived. I shall therefore call these shadows
 Derived shadows because they are produced by other shadows; and the
 third Book will treat of these. Again these derived shadows, where
 they are intercepted by various objects, produce effects as various
 as the places where they are cast and of this I will treat in the
 fourth Book. And since all round the derived shadows, where the
 derived shadows are intercepted, there is always a space where the
 light falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its
 cause, it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies
 it somewhat in its nature; and on this I will compose my fifth Book.
 Besides this, in the sixth Book I will investigate the many and
 various diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which
 will modify the original [shadow] by [imparting] some of the various
 colours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are
 derived. Again, the seventh Book will treat of the various distances
 that may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and
 that where they originate, and the various shades of colour which
 they will acquire in falling on opaque bodies.
