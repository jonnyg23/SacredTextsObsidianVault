 That portion of a body of uniform breadth which is against a lighter
 background will look narrower [than the rest].
 </p><p>
 [4] <i>e</i> is a given object, itself dark and of uniform breadth; <i>a b</i>
 and <i>c d</i> are two backgrounds one darker than the other; <i>b c</i> is a
 bright background, as it might be a spot lighted by the sun through
 an aperture in a dark room. Then I say that the object <i>e g</i> will
 appear larger at <i>e f</i> than at <i>g h</i>; because <i>e f</i> has a darker
 background than <i>g h</i>; and again at <i>f g</i> it will look narrower from
 being seen by the eye <i>o</i>, on the light background <i>b c</i>.  <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">114</font></a>
  That
 part of a luminous body, of equal breadth and brilliancy throughout,
 will look largest which is seen against the darkest background; and
 the luminous body will seem on fire.
