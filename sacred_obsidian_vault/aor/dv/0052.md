 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Experimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight (52-55).</font></span>Perspective is a rational demonstration, confirmed by experience,
 that all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of
 lines.
 </p><p>
 By a pyramid of lines I understand those lines which start from the
 edges of the surface of bodies, and converging from a distance, meet
 in a single point; and this point, in the present instance, I will
 show to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all
 objects. By a point I mean that which cannot be divided into parts;
 therefore this point, which is situated in the eye, being
 indivisible, no body is seen by the eye, that is not larger than
 this point. This being the case it is inevitable that the lines
 which come from the object to the point must form a pyramid. And if
 any man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in
 this point, but rather in the black spot which is visible in the
 middle of the pupil, I might reply to him that a small object could
 never diminish at any distance, as it might be a grain of millet or
 of oats or of some similar thing, and that object, if it were larger
 than the said [black] spot would never be seen as a whole; as may be
 seen in the diagram below. Let <i>a</i>.

 <p>be the seat of sight, <i>b e</i> the
 lines which reach the eye. Let <i>e d</i> be the grains of millet within
 these lines. You plainly see that these will never diminish by
 distance, and that the body <i>m n</i> could not be entirely covered by
 it. Therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself
 one single indivisible point <i>a</i>, to which all the points converge
 of the pyramid of lines starting from an object, as is shown below.
 Let <i>a</i>. <i>b</i>. be the eye; in the centre of it is the point

 <p>above mentioned. If the line <i>e f</i> is to enter as an image into so small
 an opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object
 cannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is
 diminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.
