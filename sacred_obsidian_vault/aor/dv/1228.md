 </p><h3 align="CENTER">FIDELITY, OR LOYALTY.</h3>
 <p>
 The cranes are so faithful and loyal to their king, that at night,
 when he is sleeping, some of them go round the field to keep watch
 at a distance; others remain near, each holding a stone in his foot,
 so that if sleep should overcome them, this stone would fall and
 make so much noise that they would wake up again. And there are
 others which sleep together round the king; and this they do every
 night, changing in turn so that their king may never find them
 wanting.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">FALSEHOOD.</h3>
 <p>
 The fox when it sees a flock of herons or magpies or birds of that
 kind, suddenly flings himself on the ground with his mouth open to
 look as he were dead; and these birds want to peck at his tongue,
 and he bites off their heads.
