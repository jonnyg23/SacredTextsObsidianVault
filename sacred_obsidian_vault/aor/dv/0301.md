 Experience shows us that the air must have darkness beyond it and
 yet it appears blue. If you produce a small quantity of smoke from
 dry wood and the rays of the sun fall on this smoke, and if you then
 place behind the smoke a piece of black velvet on which the sun does
 not shine, you will see that all the smoke which is between the eye
 and the black stuff will appear of a beautiful blue colour. And if
 instead of the velvet you place a white cloth smoke, that is too
 thick smoke, hinders, and too thin smoke does not produce, the
 perfection of this blue colour. Hence a moderate amount of smoke
 produces the finest blue. Water violently ejected in a fine spray
 and in a dark chamber where the sun beams are admitted produces
 these blue rays and the more vividly if it is distilled water, and
 thin smoke looks blue. This I mention in order to show that the
 blueness of the atmosphere is caused by the darkness beyond it, and
 these instances are given for those who cannot confirm my experience
 on Monboso.
