 An Experiment to show that a weight placed on an arch does not
 discharge itself entirely on its columns; on the contrary the
 greater the weight placed on the arches, the less the arch transmits
 the weight to the columns. The experiment is the following. Let a
 man be placed on a steel yard in the middle of the shaft of a well,
 then let him spread out his hands and feet between the walls of the
 well, and you will see him weigh much less on the steel yard; give
 him a weight on the shoulders, you will see by experiment, that the
 greater the weight you give him the greater effort he will make in
 spreading his arms and legs, and in pressing against the wall and
 the less weight will be thrown on the steel yard.
