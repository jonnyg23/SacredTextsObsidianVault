 </p><h3 align="CENTER">Domes rising from a circular base.</h3>
 <p>
 The simplest type of central building is a circular edifice.

 colonnade.

 </p><p>
 <a href="pl086.htm#img_pl086">Pl. LXXXVI</a>, No. 1, 2, 3. Four round chapels are added at the
 extremities of the two principal axes;--compare this plan with fig.
 1 on p. 44 and fig. 3 on p. 47 (W. P. 5b) where the outer wall is
 octagonal.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">Group II.</h3>
 <p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">Domes rising from a square base.</h3>
 <p>
 The plan is a square surrounded by a colonnade, and the dome seems
 to be octagonal.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>. The square plan below the circular building No. 8, and
 its elevation to the left, above the plan: here the ground-plan is
 square, the upper storey octagonal. A further development of this
 type is shown in two sketches C. A. 3a (not reproduced here), and in
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl086.htm#img_pl086">Pl. LXXXVI</a>, No. 5 (which possibly belongs to No. 7 on <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>).

 <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a>, No. 4, and p. 45, Fig. 3, a Greek cross, repeated p. 45,
 Fig. 3, is another development of the square central plan.
 </p><p>
 The remainder of these studies show two different systems; in the
 first the dome rises from a square plan,--in the second from an
 octagonal base.

 Domes rising from a square base and four pillars.  <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">369</font></a>
 
 </p><p>
 <b>a) First type</b>. <i>A Dome resting on four pillars in the centre of a
 square edifice, with an apse in the middle, of each of the four
 sides. We have eleven variations of this type.

 ee) <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a>, Nos. 1, 7, 10, 11.</p></dir></i>
 
 <b>b) Second type</b>. <i>This consists in adding aisles to the whole plan of
 the first type; columns are placed between the apses and the aisles;
 the plan thus obtained is very nearly identical with that of S.
 Lorenzo at Milan.
 </i></p><p>
 Fig. 1 on p. 56. (MS. B, 75a) shows the result of this treatment
 adapted to a peculiar purpose about which we shall have to say a few
 words later on.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl095.htm#img_pl095">Pl. XCV</a>, No. 1, shows the same plan but with the addition of a short
 nave. This plan seems to have been suggested by the general
 arrangement of S. Sepolcro at Milan.
 </p><p>
 MS. B. 57b (see the sketch reproduced on p.51). By adding towers in
 the four outer angles to the last named plan, we obtain a plan which
 bears the general features of Bramante's plans for S. Peter's at
 Rome.  <a name="fr_36"></a><a href="#fn_36"><font size="1">370</font></a>
 <i> (See
 p. 51 Fig. 1.)
 </i></p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">Group IV.</h3>
 <p>
 Domes rising from an octagonal base.
 </p><p>
 This system, developed according to two different schemes, has given
 rise to two classes with many varieties.
 </p><p>
 In a) On each side of the octagon chapels of equal form are added.
 </p><p>
 In b) The chapels are dissimilar; those which terminate the
 principal axes being different in form from those which are added on
 the diagonal sides of the octagon.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">a. First Class.</h3>
 <p>
 The Chapel "degli Angeli," <i>at Florence, built only to a height of
 about 20 feet by Brunellesco, may be considered as the prototype of
 this group; and, indeed it probably suggested it. The fact that we
 see in MS. B. 11b</i>
 </p><p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 43</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>(<a href="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</a>, No. 3) by the side of Brunellesco's
 plan for the Basilica of Sto. Spirito at Florence, a plan almost
 identical with that of the</i> Capella degli Angeli, <i>confirms this
 supposition. Only two small differences, or we may say improvements,
 have been introduced by Leonardo. Firstly the back of the chapels
 contains a third niche, and each angle of the Octagon a folded
 pilaster like those in Bramante's</i> Sagrestia di S. M. presso San
 Satiro <i>at Milan, instead of an interval between the two pilasters
 as seen in the Battistero at Florence and in the Sacristy of Sto.
 Spirito in the same town and also in the above named chapel by
 Brunellesco.
 </i></p><p>
 The first set of sketches which come under consideration have at
 first sight the appearance of mere geometrical studies. They seem to
 have been suggested by the plan given on page 44 Fig. 2 (MS. B, 55a)
 in the centre of which is written "Santa Maria in perticha da
 Pavia", <i>at the place marked A on the reproduction.
 </i></p><p>
 a) (MS. B, 34b, page 44 Fig. 3). In the middle of each side a column
 is added, and in the axes of the intercolumnar spaces a second row
 of columns forms an aisle round the octagon. These are placed at the
 intersection of a system of semicircles, of which the sixteen
 columns on the sides of the octagon are the centres.
 </p><p>
 b) The preceding diagram is completed and becomes more monumental in
 style in the sketch next to it (MS. B, 35a, see p. 45 Fig. 1). An
 outer aisle is added by circles, having for radius the distance
 between the columns in the middle sides of the octagon.
 </p><p>
 c) (MS. B. 96b, see p. 45 Fig. 2). Octagon with an aisle round it;
 the angles of both are formed by columns. The outer sides are formed
 by 8 niches forming chapels. The exterior is likewise octagonal,
 with the angles corresponding to the centre of each of the interior
 chapels.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl092.htm#img_pl092">Pl. XCII</a>, No. 2 (MS. B. 96b). Detail and modification of the
 preceding plan--half columns against piers--an arrangement by which
 the chapels of the aisle have the same width of opening as the inner
 arches between the half columns. Underneath this sketch the
 following note occurs: questo vole - avere 12 facce - co 12
 tabernaculi - come - <i>a</i> - <i>b</i>. <i>(This will have twelve sides with
 twelve tabernacles as</i> a b.<i>) In the remaining sketches of this
 class the octagon is not formed by columns at the angles.
 </i></p><p>
 The simplest type shows a niche in the middle of each side and is
 repeated on several sheets, viz: MS. B 3; MS. C.A. 354b (see <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>, No. 11) and MS. Ash II 6b; (see <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a>, No. 9 and the
 elevations No. 8; <a href="pl092.htm#img_pl092">Pl. XCII</a>, No. 3; MS. B. 4b [not reproduced here]
 and <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>, No. 2).

 slight variations.
 </p></dir>
 <p>
 D. by a circular chapel:
 </p><p>
 MS. B, 18a (see Fig. 1 on page 47) gives the plan of this
 arrangement in which the exterior is square on the ground floor with
 only four of the chapels projecting, as is explained in the next
 sketch.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl089.htm#img_pl089">Pl. LXXXIX</a>, MS. B, 17b. Elevation to the preceding plan sketched on
 the opposite side of the sheet, and also marked A. It is accompanied
 by the following remark, indicating the theoretical character of
 these studies: questo - edifitio - anchora - starebbe - bene
 affarlo dalla linja - <i>a</i> - <i>b</i> - <i>c</i> - <i>d</i> - insu. <i>("This edifice

 </i></p><p>
 <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>, No. 11. The exterior has the form of an octagon, but the
 chapels project partly beyond it. On the left side of the sketch
 they appear larger than on the right side.

 <i>E. By chapels formed by four niches:
 </i></p><p>
 <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>, No. 7 (the circular plan on the left below) shows this
 arrangement in which the central dome has become circular inside and
 might therefore be classed after this group.  <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">371</font></a>
 <i>
 </i></p><p>
 The sketch on the right hand side gives most likely the elevation
 for the last named plan.
 </p><p>
 F. By chapels of still richer combinations, which necessitate an
 octagon of larger dimensions:
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl091.htm#img_pl091">Pl. XCI</a>, No. 2 (MS. Ash. 11. 8b)  <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">372</font></a>
 <i>; on this plan the chapels
 themselves appear to be central buildings formed like the first type
 of the third group. <a href="pl088.htm#img_pl088">Pl. LXXXVIII</a>, No. 3.
 </i></p><p>
 <a href="pl091.htm#img_pl091">Pl. XCI</a>, No. 2 above; the exterior of the preceding figure,
 particularly interesting on account of the alternation of apses and
 niches, the latter containing statues of a gigantic size, in
 proportion to the dimension of the niches.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">b. Second Class.</h3>
 <p>
 Composite plans of this class are generally obtained by combining
 two types of the first class--the one worked out on the principal
 axes, the other on the diagonal ones.
 </p><p>
 MS. B. 22 shows an elementary combination, without any additions on
 the diagonal axes, but with the dimensions of the squares on the two
 principal axes exceeding those of the sides of the octagon.
 </p><p>
 In the drawing W. P. 5b (see page 44 Fig. 1) the exterior only of
 the edifice is octagonal, the interior being formed by a circular
 colonnade; round chapels are placed against the four sides of the
 principal axes.
 </p><p>
 The elevation, drawn on the same sheet (see page 47 Fig. 3), shows
 the whole arrangement which is closely related with the one on <a href="pl086.htm#img_pl086">Pl. LXXXVI</a> No. 1, 2.
 </p><p>
 MS. B. 21a shows:
 </p><dir>
 a) four sides with rectangular chapels crowned by pediments <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 3 (plan and elevation);
 <p>
 b) four sides with square chapels crowned by octagonal domes. <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 4; the plan underneath.
 </p></dir>
 <p>
 MS. B. 18a shows a variation obtained by replacing the round chapels
 in the principal axes of the sketch MS. B. l8a by square ones, with
 an
 </p><p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>
 <p><i>apse. Leonardo repeated both ideas for better comparison side by
 side, see page 47. Fig. 2.
 </i></p><p>
 <a href="pl089.htm#img_pl089">Pl. LXXXIX</a> (MS. B. 17b). Elevation for the preceding figure. The
 comparison of the drawing marked M with the plan on page 47 Fig. 2,
 bearing the same mark, and of the elevation on <a href="pl089.htm#img_pl089">Pl. LXXXIX</a> below
 (marked A) with the corresponding plan on page 47 is highly
 instructive, as illustrating the spirit in which Leonardo pursued
 these studies.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a> No. 12 shows the design <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 3 combined with
 apses, with the addition of round chapels on the diagonal sides.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a> No. 13 is a variation of the preceding sketch.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl090.htm#img_pl090">Pl. XC</a> No. 3. MS. B. 25b. The round chapels of the preceding sketch
 are replaced by octagonal chapels, above which rise campaniles.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl090.htm#img_pl090">Pl. XC</a> No. 4 is the elevation for the preceding plan.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl092.htm#img_pl092">Pl. XCII</a> No. 1. (MS. B. 39b.); the plan below. On the principal as
 well as on the diagonal axes are diagonal chapels, but the latter
 are separated from the dome by semicircular recesses. The
 communication between these eight chapels forms a square aisle round
 the central dome.
 </p><p>
 Above this figure is the elevation, showing four campaniles on the
 angles.  <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">373</font></a>
 
 </p><p>
 <i><a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a> No. 3. On the principal axes are square chapels with
 three niches; on the diagonals octagonal chapels with niches. Cod.
 Atl. 340b gives a somewhat similar arrangement.
 </i></p><p>
 MS. B. 30. The principal development is thrown on the diagonal axes
 by square chapels with three niches; on the principal axes are inner
 recesses communicating with outer ones.
 </p><p>
 The plan <a href="pl093.htm#img_pl093">Pl. XCIII</a> No. 2 (MS. B. 22) differs from this only in so
 far as the outer semicircles have become circular chapels,
 projecting from the external square as apses; one of them serves as
 the entrance by a semicircular portico.
 </p><p>
 The elevation is drawn on the left side of the plan.
 </p><p>
 MS. B. 19. A further development of MS. B. 18, by employing for the
 four principal chapels the type <a href="pl088.htm#img_pl088">Pl. LXXXVIII</a> No. 3, as we have
 already seen in <a href="pl091.htm#img_pl091">Pl. XCI</a> No. 2; the exterior presents two varieties.
 </p><p>
 a) The outer contour follows the inner.  <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">374</font></a>
 <i>
 </i></p><p>
 b) It is semicircular.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 2 (MS. B. 18b) Elevation to the first variation MS.
 B. 19. If we were not certain that this sketch was by Leonardo, we
 might feel tempted to take it as a study by Bramante for St. Peter's
 at Rome.  <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">375</font></a>
 
 </p><p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>MS. P. V. 39b. In the principal axes the chapels of MS. B. 19, and
 semicircular niches on the diagonals. The exterior of the whole
 edifice is also an octagon, concealing the form of the interior
 chapels, but with its angles on their axes.
 </i></p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">Group V.</h3>
 <p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">Suggested by San Lorenzo at Milan.</h3>
 <p>
 In MS. C. A. 266 IIb, 8l2b there is a plan almost identical with
 that of San Lorenzo. The diagonal sides of the irregular octagon are
 not indicated.
 </p><p>
 If it could be proved that the arches which, in the actual church,
 exist on these sides in the first story, were added in 1574 by
 Martimo Bassi, then this plan and the following section would be
 still nearer the original state of San Lorenzo than at present. A
 reproduction of this slightly sketched plan has not been possible.
 It may however be understood from <a href="pl088.htm#img_pl088">Pl. LXXXVIII</a> No. 3, by suppressing
 the four pillars corresponding to the apses.
 </p><p>
 <a href="pl087.htm#img_pl087">Pl. LXXXVII</a> No. 1 shows the section in elevation corresponding with
 the above-named plan. The recessed chapels are decorated with large
 shells in the halfdomes like the arrangement in San Lorenzo, but
 with proportions like those of Bramante's Sacristy of Santa Maria
 presso S. Satiro.
 </p><p>
 MS. C. A. 266; a sheet containing three views of exteriors of Domes.
 On the same sheet there is a plan similar to the one above-named but
 with uninterrupted aisles and with the addition of round chapels in
 the axes (compare <a href="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</a> No. 3 and page 44 Fig. 1), perhaps a
 reminiscence of the two chapels annexed to San Lorenzo.--Leonardo
 has here sketched the way of transforming this plan into a Latin
 cross by means of a nave with side aisles.
