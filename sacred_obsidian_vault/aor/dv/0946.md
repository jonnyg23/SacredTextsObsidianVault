 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Refutation of Pliny's theory as to the saltness of the sea (946. 947).</font></span>Pliny says in his second book, chapter 103, that the water of the
 sea is salt because the heat of the sun dries up the moisture and
 drinks it up; and this gives to the wide stretching sea the savour
 of salt. But this cannot be admitted, because if the saltness of the
 sea were caused by the heat of the sun, there can be no doubt that
 lakes, pools and marshes would be so much the more salt, as their
 waters have less motion and are of less depth; but experience shows
 us, on the contrary, that these lakes have their waters quite free
 from salt. Again it is stated by Pliny in the same chapter that this
 saltness might originate,
 </p><p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>
 <p>because all the sweet and subtle portions
 which the heat attracts easily being taken away, the more bitter and
 coarser part will remain, and thus the water on the surface is
 fresher than at the bottom  <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">499</font></a>
 ; but this
 is contradicted by the same reason given above, which is, that the
 same thing would happen in marshes and other waters, which are dried
 up by the heat. Again, it has been said that the saltness of the sea
 is the sweat of the earth; to this it may be answered that all the
 springs of water which penetrate through the earth, would then be
 salt. But the conclusion is, that the saltness of the sea must
 proceed from the many springs of water which, as they penetrate into
 the earth, find mines of salt and these they dissolve in part, and
 carry with them to the ocean and the other seas, whence the clouds,
 the begetters of rivers, never carry it up. And the sea would be
 salter in our times than ever it was at any time; and if the
 adversary were to say that in infinite time the sea would dry up or
 congeal into salt, to this I answer that this salt is restored to
 the earth by the setting free of that part of the earth which rises
 out of the sea with the salt it has acquired, and the rivers return
 it to the earth under the sea.

 . <i>Itaque Solis ardore
 siccatur liquor: et hoc esse masculum sidus accepimus, torrens
 cuncta sorbensque.</i> (cp. CIV.) <i>Sic mari late patenti saporem
 incoqui salis, aut quia exhausto inde dulci tenuique, quod facillime
 trahat vis ignea, omne asperius crassiusque linquatur: ideo summa
 aequorum aqua dulciorem profundam; hanc esse veriorem causam, quam
 quod mare terrae sudor sit aeternus: aut quia plurimum ex arido
 misceatur illi vapore: aut quia terrae natura sicut medicatas aquas
 inficiat</i> ... (cp. CV): <i>altissimum mare XV. stadiorum Fabianus
 tradit. Alii n Ponto coadverso Coraxorum gentis (vocant B Ponti)
 trecentis fere a continenti stadiis immensam altitudinem maris
 tradunt, vadis nunquam repertis.</i> (cp. CVI [CIII]) <i>Mirabilius id
 faciunt aquae dulces, juxta mare, ut fistulis emicantes. Nam nec
 aquarum natura a miraculis cessat. Dulces mari invehuntur, leviores
 haud dubie. Ideo et marinae, quarum natura gravior, magis invecta
 sustinent. Quaedam vero et dulces inter se supermeant alias.</i>]
