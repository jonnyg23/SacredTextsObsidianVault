 Johannes Antonius di Johannes Ambro-
 sius de Bolate. He who lets time pass and
 does not grow in virtue, the more I think
 of it the more I grieve. No man has it in
 him to be virtuous who will give up honour
 for gain. Good fortune is valueless to him
 who knows not toil. The man becomes
 happy who follows Christ. There is no perfect
 gift without great suffering. Our glories
 and our triumphs pass away. Foul lust, and
 dreams, and luxury, and sloth have banished
 every virtue from the world; so that our
 Nature, wandering and perplexed, has almost
 lost the old and better track. Henceforth it
 were well to rouse thyself from sleep. The
 master said that lying in down will not bring
 thee to Fame; nor staying beneath the quilts.
 He who, without Fame, burns his life to waste,
 leaves no more vestige of himself on earth than
 wind-blown smoke, or the foam upon the sea.
