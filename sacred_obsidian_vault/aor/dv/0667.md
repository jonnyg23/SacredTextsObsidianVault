 <p><a name="fn_306"></a><a href="0667.htm#fr_306">347:304</a> : As this note is in the same small Manuscript as the
 passage here immediately preceding it, I may be justified in
 assuming that Leonardo meant to use the features of the person here
 named as a suitable model for the figure of Christ. The celebrated
 drawing of the head of Christ, now hanging in the Brera Gallery at
 Milan, has obviously been so much restored that it is now impossible
 to say, whether it was ever genuine. We have only to compare it with
 the undoubtedly genuine drawings of heads of the disciples in
 <a href="pl047.htm#img_pl047">Pl. XLVII</a>,  and , to admit that not a single line of the Milan
 drawing in its present state can be by the same hand.</p>
