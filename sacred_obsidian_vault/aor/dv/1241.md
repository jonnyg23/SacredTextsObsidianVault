 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE CROCODILE. HYPOCRISY.</h3>
 <p>
 This animal catches a man and straightway kills him; after he is
 dead, it weeps for him with a lamentable voice and many tears. Then,
 having done lamenting, it cruelly devours him. It is thus with the
 hypocrite, who, for the smallest matter, has his face bathed with
 tears, but shows the heart of a tiger and rejoices in his heart at
 the woes of others, while wearing a pitiful face.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE TOAD.</h3>
 <p>
 The toad flies from the light of the sun, and if it is held there by
 force it puffs itself out so much as to hide its head below and
 shield itself from the rays. Thus does the foe of clear and radiant
 virtue, who can only be constrainedly brought to face it with puffed
 up courage.
