 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Some practical hints (706-709).</font></span>If you wish to make a figure in marble, first make one of clay, and
 when you have finished it, let it dry and place it in a case which
 should be large enough, after the figure is taken out of it, to
 receive also the marble, from which you intend to reveal the figure
 in imitation of the one in clay. After you have put the clay figure
 into this said case, have little rods which will exactly slip in to
 the holes in it, and thrust them so far in at each hole that each
 white rod may touch the figure in different parts of it. And colour
 the portion of the rod that remains outside black, and mark each rod
 and each hole with a countersign so that each may fit into its
 place. Then take the clay figure out of this case and put in your
 piece of marble, taking off so much of the marble that all your rods
 may be hidden in the holes as far as their marks; and to be the
 better able to do this, make the case so that it can be lifted up;
 but the bottom of it will always remain under the marble and in this
 way it can be lifted with tools with great ease.
