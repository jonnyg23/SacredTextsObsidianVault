 looking through a very small hole made with the extreme point of a
 very fine needle, placed so as almost to touch the eye), you will
 see those stars so minute that it would seem as though nothing could
 be smaller; it is in fact their great distance which is the reason
 of their diminution, for many of them are very many times larger
 than the star which is the earth with water. Now reflect what this

 no larger than it appears; among these was Epicurus, and I believe
 that he founded his reason on the effects of a light placed in our

 Himmelskunde</i>, did not devote much attention to the study of
 celestial phenomena--, he probably derived from Book X of Diogenes
 Laertius, whose <i>Vitae Philosophorum</i> was not printed in Greek till
 1533, but the Latin translation appeared in 1475.</p>
