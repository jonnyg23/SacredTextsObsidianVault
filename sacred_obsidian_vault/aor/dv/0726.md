 All coins which do not have the rim complete, are not to be accepted
 as good; and to secure the perfection of their rim it is requisite
 that, in the first place, all the coins should be a perfect circle;
 and to do this a coin must before all be made perfect in weight, and
 size, and thickness. Therefore have several plates of metal made of
 the same size and thickness, all drawn through the same gauge so as
 to come out in strips. And out of [24] these strips you will stamp
 the coins, quite round, as sieves are made for sorting chestnuts
 [27]; and these coins can then be stamped in the way indicated
 above; &amp;c
 </p><p>
 [31] The hollow of the die must be uniformly wider than the lower,
 but imperceptibly [35].
 </p><p>
 This cuts the coins perfectly round and of the exact thickness, and
 weight; and saves the man who cuts and weighs, and the man who makes
 the coins round. Hence it passes only through the hands of the
 gauger and of the stamper, and the coins are very superior.

 Farther evidence of Leonardo's occupations and engagements at Rome
 under Pope Leo X. may be gathered from some rough copies of letters
 which will be found in this volume. Hitherto nothing has been known
 of his work in Rome beyond some doubtful, and perhaps mythical,
 statements in Vasari.</p>
