 <p>
 As to men and horses represented in battle, their different parts
 will be dark in proportion as they are nearer to the ground on which
 they stand. And this is proved by the sides of wells which grow
 darker in proportion to their depth, the reason of which is that the
 deepest part of the well sees and receives a smaller amount of the
 luminous atmosphere than any other part.
 </p><p>
 And the pavement, if it be of the same colour as the legs of these
 said men and horses, will always be more lighted and at a more
 direct angle than the said legs &amp;c
