  <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">1337</font></a>Having often made you, by my letters, acquainted with the things
 which have happened, I think I ought not to be silent as to the
 events of the last few days, which--[2]...
 </p><p>
 Having several times--
 </p><p>
 Having many times rejoiced with you by letters over your prosperous
 fortunes, I know now that, as a friend you will be sad with me over
 the miserable state in which I find myself; and this is, that during
 the last few days I have been in so much trouble, fear, peril and
 loss, besides the miseries of the people here, that we have been
 envious of the dead; and certainly I do not believe that since the
 elements by their separation reduced the vast chaos to order, they
 have ever combined their force and fury to do so much mischief to
 man. As far as regards
 </p><p>
 
 
 </p><p><a name="page_393"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 393</font></a></p>
 <p>us here, what we have seen and gone through
 is such that I could not imagine that things could ever rise to such
 an amount of mischief, as we experienced in the space of ten hours.
 In the first place we were assailed and attacked by the violence and
 fury of the winds [10]; to this was added the falling of great
 mountains of snow which filled up all this valley, thus destroying a
 great part of our city [ <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">11</font></a>]. And not content with this the tempest
 sent a sudden flood of water to submerge all the low part of this city [12];
 added to which there came a sudden rain, or rather a ruinous torrent and flood of
 water, sand, mud, and stones, entangled with roots, and stems and
 fragments of various trees; and every kind of thing flying through
 the air fell upon us; finally a great fire broke out, not brought by
 the wind, but carried as it would seem, by ten thousand devils,
 which completely burnt up all this neighbourhood and it has not yet
 ceased. And those few who remain unhurt are in such dejection and
 such terror that they hardly have courage to speak to each other, as
 if they were stunned. Having abandoned all our business, we stay
 here together in the ruins of some churches, men and women mingled
 together, small and great[ <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">17</font></a>], just like herds of goats.
  <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">18</font></a>The neighbours out of pity succoured us with victuals, and they
 had previously been our enemies. And if
 </p><p>
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 </p><p><a name="page_394"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 394</font></a></p>
 <p>it had not been for certain people who succoured us with
 victuals, all would have died of hunger. Now you see the state we
 are in. And all these evils are as nothing compared with those which
 are promised to us shortly.
 </p><p>
 I know that as a friend you will grieve for my misfortunes, as I, in
 former letters have shown my joy at your prosperity ...

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_359"></a><a href="1337.htm#fr_359">392:1337</a> On comparing this commencement of a letter l. 1-2
 with that in l. 3 and 4 of No. 1336 it is quite evident that both
 refer to the same event. (Compare also No. 1337 l. 10-l2 and 17 with
 No. 1336 l. 23, 24 and 32.) But the text No. 1336, including the
 fragment l. 3-4, was obviously written later than the draft here
 reproduced. The <i>Diodario</i> is not directly addressed--the person
 addressed indeed is not known--and it seems to me highly probable
 that it was written to some other patron and friend whose name and
 position are not mentioned.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_360"></a><a href="1337.htm#fr_360">393:11</a> <i>Della nostra citta</i> (Leonardo
 first wrote <i>di questa citta</i>). From this we may infer that he had
 at some time lived in the place in question wherever it might be.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_361"></a><a href="1337.htm#fr_361">393:17</a> <i>Certe ruine di chiese</i>. Either of Armenian churches or of Mosques,
 which it was not unusual to speak of as churches.
 </p><p>
 <i>Maschi e femmini insieme unite</i>, implies an infringement of the
 usually strict rule of the separation of the sexes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_362"></a><a href="1337.htm#fr_362">393:18</a> <i>I vicini, nostri nimici</i>. The town must then have
 stood quite close to the frontier of the country. Compare 1336. L.
 7. <i>vicini ai nostri confini</i>. Dr. M. JORDAN has already published
 lines 4-13 (see <i>Das Malerbuch, Leipzig</i>, 1873, p. 90:--his reading
 differs from mine) under the title of "Description of a landscape
 near Lake Como". We do in fact find, among other loose sheets in the
 Codex Atlanticus, certain texts referring to valleys of the Alps
 (see Nos. 1030, 1031 and note p. 237) and in the arrangement of the
 loose sheets, of which the Codex Atlanticus has been formed, these
 happen to be placed close to this text. The compiler stuck both on
 the same folio sheet; and if this is not the reason for Dr. JORDAN'S
 choosing such a title (Description &amp;c) I cannot imagine what it can
 have been. It is, at any rate, a merely hypothetical statement. The
 designation of the population of the country round a city as "the
 enemy" (<i>nemici</i>) is hardly appropriate to Italy in the time of
 Leonardo.</p>
