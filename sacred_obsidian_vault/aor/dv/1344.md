 <p>
 I am greatly vexed to be in necessity, but I still more regret that
 this should be the cause of the hindrance of my wish which is always
 disposed to obey your Excellency.
 </p><p>
 Perhaps your Excellency did not give further orders to Messer
 Gualtieri, believing that I had money enough.
 </p><p>
 I am greatly annoyed that you should have found me in necessity, and
 that my having to earn my living should have hindered me ...
 </p><p>
 [12] It vexes me greatly that having to earn my living has forced me
 to interrupt the work and to attend to small matters, instead of
 following up the work which your Lordship entrusted to me. But I
 hope in a short time to have earned so much that I may carry it out
 quietly to the satisfaction of your Excellency, to whom I commend
 myself; and if your Lordship thought that I had money, your Lordship
 was deceived. I had to feed 6 men for 56 months, and have had 50
 ducats.
