 When the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,
 it will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at
 it. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when
 seen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear
 smaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A
 luminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as
 it is farther from the eye.
