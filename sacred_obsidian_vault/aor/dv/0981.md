 <p>
 The summits of mountains for a long time rise constantly.
 </p><p>
 The opposite sides of the mountains always approach each other
 below; the depths of the valleys which are above the sphere of the
 waters are in the course of time constantly getting nearer to the
 centre of the world.
 </p><p>
 In an equal period, the valleys sink much more than the mountains
 rise.
 </p><p>
 The bases of the mountains always come closer together.
 </p><p>
 In proportion as the valleys become deeper, the more quickly are
 their sides worn away.
