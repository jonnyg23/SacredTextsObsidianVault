 In the position of the eye which sees that portion of a tree
 illuminated which turns towards the light, one tree will never be
 seen to be illuminated equally with the other. To prove this, let
 the eye be <i>c</i> which sees

 the two trees <i>b d</i> which are illuminated
 by the sun <i>a</i>; I say that this eye <i>c</i> will not see the light in
 the same proportion to the shade, in one tree as in the other.
 Because, the tree which is nearest to the sun will display so much
 the stronger shadow than the more distant one, in proportion as one
 tree is nearer to the rays of the sun that converge to the eye than
 the other; &amp;c
 <p>
 You see that the eye <i>c</i> sees nothing of the tree <i>d</i> but shadow,
 while the same eye <i>c</i> sees thè tree <i>b</i> half in light and half in
 shade.

 When a tree is seen from below, the eye sees the top of it as placed
 within the circle made by its boughs[23].
 </p><p>
 Remember, O Painter! that the variety of depth of shade in any one
 particular species of tree is in proportion to the rarity or density
 of their branches.
