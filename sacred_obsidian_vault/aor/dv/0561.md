 <p>
 Where a shadow ends in the light, note carefully where it is paler
 or deeper and where it is more or less indistinct towards the light;
 and, above all, in [painting] youthful figures I remind you not to
 make the shadow end like a stone, because flesh has a certain
 transparency, as may be seen by looking at a hand held between the
 eye and the sun, which shines through it ruddy and bright. Place the
 most highly coloured part between the light and shadow. And to see
 what shadow tint is needed on the flesh, cast a shadow on it with
 your finger, and according as you wish to see it lighter or darker
 hold your finger nearer to or farther from your picture, and copy
 that [shadow].
