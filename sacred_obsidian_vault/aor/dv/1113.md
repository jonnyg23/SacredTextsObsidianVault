 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The ship's logs of Vitruvius, of Alberti and of Leonardo</font></span>The ancients used various devices to ascertain the distance gone by
 a ship each hour, among which Vitruvius  <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">617</font></a>
  gives one in his work on Architecture which is just as
 fallacious as all the others; and this is a mill wheel which touches
 the waves of the sea at one end and in each complete revolution
 describes a straight line which represents the circumference of the
 wheel extended to a straightness. But this invention is of no worth
 excepting on the smooth and motionless surface of lakes. But if the
 water moves together with the ship at an equal rate, then the wheel
 remains motionless; and if the motion of the water is more or less
 rapid than that of the ship, then neither has the wheel the same
 motion as the ship so that this invention is of but little use.
 There is another method tried by experiment with a known distance
 between one island and another; and this is done by a board or under
 the pressure of wind which strikes on it with more or less
 swiftness. This is in Battista Alberti  <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">618</font></a>
 .

 <p>Battista Alberti's method which is made by experiment on a known
 distance between one island and another. But such an invention does
 not succeed excepting on a ship like the one on which the experiment
 was made, and it must be of the same burden and have the same sails,
 and the sails in the same places, and the size of the waves must be
 the same. But my method will serve for any ship, whether with oars
 or sails; and whether it be small or large, broad or long, or high
 or low, it always serves  <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">619</font></a>

 <i>De Architectura lib. X.</i> C. 14 (p. 264 in the edition of Rose and
 Muller- Strubing). The German edition published at Bale in 1543 has,
 on fol. 596, an illustration of the contrivance, as described by
 Vitruvius.</p>

 ALBERTI, <i>De Architectura lib. V.</i>, c. 12 treats '<i>de le navi e
 parti loro</i>', but there is no reference to the machine, mentioned by
 Leonardo. Alberti says here: <i>Noi abbiamo trattato lungamente in
 altro luogo de' modi de le navi, ma in questo luogo ne abbiamo detto
 quel tanto che si bisogna</i>. To this the following note is added in
 the most recent Italian edition: <i>Questo libro e tuttora inedito e
 porta il titolo, secondo Gesnero di</i> '<i>Liber navis</i>'.</p>
