 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The theory of Plato.</font></span>Of the figures of the elements; and first as against those who deny
 the opinions of Plato, and who say that if the elements include one
 another in the forms attributed to them by Plato they would cause a
 vacuum one within the other. I say it is not true, and I here prove
 it, but first I desire to propound some conclusions. It is not
 necessary that the elements which include each other should be of
 corresponding magnitude in all the parts, of that which includes and
 of that which is included. We see that the sphere of the waters
 varies conspicuously in mass from the surface to the bottom, and
 that, far from investing the earth when that was in the form of a
 cube that is of 8 angles as Plato will have it, that it invests the
 earth which has innumerable angles of rock covered by the water and
 various prominences and concavities, and yet no vacuum is generated
 between the earth and water; again, the air invests the sphere of
 waters together with the mountains and valleys, which rise above
 that sphere, and no vacuum remains between the earth and the air, so
 that any one who says a vacuum is generated, speaks foolishly.
 </p><p>
 But to Plato I would reply that the surface of the figures which
 according to him the elements would have, could not exist.

 That the flow of rivers proves the slope of the land.
