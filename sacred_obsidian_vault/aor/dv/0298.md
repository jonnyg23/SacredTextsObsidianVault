 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHY THE ATMOSPHERE MUST BE REPRESENTED AS PALER TOWARDS THE LOWER PORTION.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the relative density of the atmosphere (298--290).</font></span>Because the atmosphere is dense near the earth, and the higher it is
 the rarer it becomes. When the sun is in the East if you look
 towards the West and a little way to the South and North, you will
 see that this dense atmosphere receives more light from the sun than
 the rarer; because the rays meet with greater resistance. And if the
 sky, as you see it, ends on a low plain, that lowest portion of the
 sky will be seen through a denser and whiter atmosphere, which will
 weaken its true colour as seen through that medium, and there the
 sky will look whiter than it is above you, where the line of sight
 travels through a smaller space of air charged with heavy vapour.
 And if you turn to the East, the atmosphere will appear darker as
 you look lower down because the luminous rays pass less freely
 through the lower atmosphere.
