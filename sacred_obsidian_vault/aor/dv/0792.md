 <p>
 A pillar of which the thickness is increased will gain more than its
 due strength, in direct proportion to what its loses in relative
 height.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">EXAMPLE.</h3>
 <p>
 If a pillar should be nine times as high as it is broad--that is to
 say, if it is one braccio thick, according to rule it should be nine
 braccia high--then, if you place 100 such pillars together in a mass
 this will be ten braccia broad and 9 high; and if the first pillar
 could carry 10000 pounds the second being only about as high as it
 is wide, and thus lacking 8 parts of its proper length, it, that is
 to say, each pillar thus united, will bear eight times more than
 when disconnected; that is to say, that if at first it would carry
 ten thousand pounds, it would now carry 90 thousand.
