 That the sun could not be mirrored in the body of the moon, which is
 a convex mirror,

 <p>in such a way as that so much of its surface as is
 illuminated by the sun, should reflect the sun unless the moon had a
 surface adapted to reflect it--in waves and ridges, like the surface
 of the sea when its surface is moved by the wind.

 The waves in water multiply the image of the object reflected in it.
 </p><p>
 These waves reflect light, each by its own line, as the surface of
 the fir cone does  <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">471</font></a>

 These are 2 figures one different from the other; one with
 undulating water and the other with smooth water.

 It is impossible that at any distance the image of the sun cast on
 the surface of a spherical body should occupy the half of the
 sphere.

 Here you must prove that the earth produces all the same effects
 with regard to the moon, as the moon with regard to the earth.

 The moon, with its reflected light, does not shine like the sun,
 because the light of the moon is not a continuous reflection of that
 of the sun on its whole surface, but only on the crests and hollows
 of the waves of its waters; and thus the sun being confusedly
 reflected, from the admixture of the shadows that lie between the
 lustrous waves, its light is not pure and clear as the sun is.

 fifteenth day in the West.  <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">474</font></a>
  The moon on the fifteenth [day] between the earth
 and the sun. [41]Here it is the moon which has the sun to the West
 and the earth to the East.
