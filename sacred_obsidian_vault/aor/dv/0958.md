 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE FLOW AND EBB.</h3>
 <p>
 All seas have their flow and ebb in the same period, but they seem
 to vary because the days do not begin at the same time throughout
 the universe; in such wise as that when it is midday in our
 hemisphere, it is midnight in the opposite hemisphere; and at the
 Eastern boundary of the two hemispheres the night begins which
 follows on the day, and at the Western boundary of these hemispheres
 begins the day, which follows the night from the opposite side.
 Hence it is to be inferred that the above mentioned swelling and
 diminution in the height of the seas, although they take place in
 one and the same space of time, are seen to vary from the above
 mentioned causes. The waters are then withdrawn into the fissures
 which start from the depths of the sea and which ramify inside the
 body of the earth, corresponding to the sources of rivers, which are
 constantly taking from the bottom of the sea the water which has
 flowed into it. A sea of water is incessantly being drawn off from
 the surface of the sea. And if you should think that the moon,
 rising at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean sea must there begin
 to attract to herself the waters of the sea, it would follow that we
 must at once see the effect of it at the Eastern end of that sea.
 Again, as the Mediterranean sea is about the eighth part of the
 circumference of the aqueous sphere, being 3000 miles long, while
 the flow and ebb only occur 4 times in 24 hours, these results would
 not agree with the time of 24 hours, unless this Mediterranean sea
 were six thousand miles in length; because if such a superabundance
 of water had to pass through the straits of Gibraltar in running
 behind the moon, the rush of the water through that strait would be
 so great, and would rise to such a height, that beyond the straits
 it would for many miles rush so violently into the ocean as to cause
 floods and tremendous seething, so that it would be impossible to
 pass through. This agitated ocean would afterwards return the waters it
 </p><p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>
 <p>had received with equal fury to the place they had come from, so
 that no one ever could pass through those straits. Now experience
 shows that at every hour they are passed in safety, but when the
 wind sets in the same direction as the current, the strong ebb
 increases  <a name="fr_170"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">504</font></a>
 . The sea does not raise the water that has issued
 from the straits, but it checks them and this retards the tide; then
 it makes up with furious haste for the time it has lost until the
 end of the ebb movement.

 Mediterranean, vessels are sometimes detained for a considerable
 time; not merely by the causes mentioned by Leonardo but by the
 constant current flowing eastwards through the middle of the straits
 of Gibraltar.</p>
