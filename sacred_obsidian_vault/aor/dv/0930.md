 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The arrangement of Book I.</font></span>Define first what is meant by height and depth; also how the
 elements are situated one inside another. Then, what is meant by
 solid weight and by liquid weight; but first what weight and
 lightness are in themselves. Then describe why water moves, and why
 its motion ceases; then why it becomes slower or more rapid; besides
 this, how it always falls, being in contact with the air but lower
 than the air. And how water rises in the air by means of the heat of
 the sun, and then falls again in rain; again, why water springs
 forth from the tops of mountains; and if the water of any spring
 higher than the ocean can pour forth water higher than the surface
 of that ocean. And how all the water that returns to the ocean is
 higher than the sphere of waters. And how the waters of the
 equatorial seas are higher than the waters of the North, and higher
 beneath the body of the sun than in any part of the equatorial
 circle; for experiment shows that under the heat of a burning brand
 the water near the brand boils, and the water surrounding this
 ebullition always sinks

 <p>with a circular eddy. And how the waters of
 the North are lower than the other seas, and more so as they become
 colder, until they are converted into ice.
