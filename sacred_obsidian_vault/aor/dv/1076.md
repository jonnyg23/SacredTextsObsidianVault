 <p>
 As to whether it is better that the water should all be raised in a
 single turn or in two?
 </p><p>
 The answer is that in one single turn the wheel could not support
 all the water that it can raise in two turns, because at the half
 turn of the wheel it would be raising 100 pounds and no more; and if
 it had to raise the whole, 200 pounds in one turn, it could not
 raise them unless the wheel were of double the diameter and if the
 diameter were doubled, the time of its revolution would be doubled;
 therefore it is better and a greater advantage in expense to make
 such a wheel of half the size (?) &amp;c
 </p><p>
 The going down of the nave of the wheel must not be so low as to
 touch the surface of the water, because by touching the water its momentum
 will be lessened.
 </p><p>
 And if on the contrary the conduit for the water were ten times the size of the
 pipe for the water escaping from it, and if it had ten times less motion,
 what would be its office? This is answered by the 9<sup>th</sup> of this which
 says that the water would rise in the pipe whence it first flow, to a tenth
 part of its original height. <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">592</font></a>

 of this passage arises from the circumstance that it is written on
 the reverse of the sheet on which we find the text relating to
 Romorantin, No. 1074.</p>
