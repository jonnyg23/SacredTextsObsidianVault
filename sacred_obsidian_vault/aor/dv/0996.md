 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the motion of air (996--999).</font></span>That the return eddies of wind at the mouth of certain valleys
 strike upon the waters and scoop them out in a great hollow, whirl
 the water into the air in the form of a column, and of the colour of
 a cloud. And I saw this thing happen on a sand bank in the Arno,
 where the sand was hollowed out to a greater depth than the stature
 of a man; and with it the gravel was whirled round and flung about
 for a great space; it appeared in the air in the form of a great
 bell-tower; and the top spread like the branches of a pine tree, and
 then it bent at the contact of the direct wind, which passed over
 from the mountains.
