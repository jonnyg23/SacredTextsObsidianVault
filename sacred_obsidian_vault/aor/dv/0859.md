 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The fundamental laws of the solar system (859-864).</font></span>Force arises from dearth or abundance; it is the child of physical
 motion, and the grand-child of spiritual motion, and the mother and
 origin of gravity. Gravity is limited to the elements of water and
 earth; but this force is unlimited, and by it infinite worlds might
 be moved if instruments could be made by which the force could be
 generated.
 </p><p>
 Force, with physical motion, and gravity, with resistance are the
 four external powers on which all actions of mortals depend.
 </p><p>
 Force has its origin in spiritual motion; and this motion, flowing
 through the limbs of sentient animals, enlarges their muscles. Being
 enlarged by this current the muscles are shrunk in length and
 contract the tendons which are connected with them, and this is the
 cause of the force of the limbs in man.
 </p><p>
 The quality and quantity of the force of a man are able to give
 birth to other forces, which will be proportionally greater as the
 motions produced by them last longer.
