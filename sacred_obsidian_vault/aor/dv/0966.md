 <p>
 The water of the ocean cannot make its way from the bases to the
 tops of the mountains

 which bound it, but only so much rises as the
 dryness of the mountain attracts. And if, on the contrary, the rain,
 which penetrates from the summit of the mountain to the base, which
 is the boundary of the sea, descends and softens the slope opposite
 to the said mountain and constantly draws the water, like a syphon
  <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">508</font></a>
  which
 pours through its longest side, it must be this which draws up the
 water of the sea; thus if <i>s n</i> were the surface of the sea, and the
 rain descends from the top of the mountain <i>a</i> to <i>n</i> on one side,
 and on the other sides it descends from <i>a</i> to <i>m</i>, without a doubt
 this would occur after the manner of distilling through felt, or as
 happens through the tubes called syphons  <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_175"><font size="1">509</font></a>
 . And at all times the water
 which has softened the mountain, by the great rain which runs down
 the two opposite sides, would constantly attract the rain <i>a n</i>, on
 its longest side together with the water from the sea, if that side
 of the mountain <i>a m</i> were longer than the other <i>a n</i>; but this
 cannot be, because no part of the earth which is not submerged by
 the ocean can be lower than that ocean.
