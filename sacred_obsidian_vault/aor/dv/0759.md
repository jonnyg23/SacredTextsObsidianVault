 <p>
 </p><p>
 Twelve flights of steps led up to the great temple, which was eight
 hundred braccia in circumference and built on an octagonal plan. At
 the eight corners were eight large plinths, one braccia and a half
 high, and three wide, and six long at the bottom, with an angle in
 the middle; on these were eight great pillars, standing on the
 plinths as a foundation, and twenty four braccia high. And on the
 top of these were eight capitals three braccia long and six wide,
 above which were the architrave frieze and cornice, four braccia and
 a half high, and this was carried on in a straight line from one
 pillar to the next and so, continuing for eight hundred braccia,
 surrounded the whole temple, from pillar to pillar. To support this
 entablature there were ten large columns of the same height as the
 pillars, three braccia thick above their bases which were one
 braccia and a half high.
 </p><p>
 The ascent to this temple was by twelve flights of steps, and the
 temple was on the twelfth, of an octagonal form, and at each angle
 rose a large pillar; and between the pillars were placed ten columns
 of the
 </p><p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>
 <p>same height as the pillars, rising at once from the pavement
 to a height of twenty eight braccia and a half; and at this height
 the architrave, frieze and cornice were placed which surrounded the
 temple having a length of eight hundred braccia. At the same height,
 and within the temple at the same level, and all round the centre of
 the temple at a distance of 24 braccia farther in, are pillars
 corresponding to the eight pillars in the angles, and columns
 corresponding to those placed in the outer spaces. These rise to the
 same height as the former ones, and over these the continuous
 architrave returns towards the outer row of pillars and columns.

 <p><a name="fn_53"></a><a href="0759.htm#fr_53">65:387</a> : Either this description is incomplete, or, as seems to me
 highly probable, it refers to some ruin. The enormous dimensions
 forbid our supposing this to be any temple in Italy or Greece. Syria
 was the native land of colossal octagonal buildings, in the early
 centuries A. D. The Temple of Baalbek, and others are even larger
 than that here described. J. P. R.</p>
