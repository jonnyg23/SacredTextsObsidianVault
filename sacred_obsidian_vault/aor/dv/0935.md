 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE SEA WHICH CHANGES THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH.</h3>
 <p>
 The shells, oysters, and other similar animals, which originate in
 sea-mud, bear witness to the changes of the earth round the centre
 of our elements. This is proved thus: Great rivers always run
 turbid, being coloured by the earth, which is stirred by the
 friction of their waters at the bottom and on their shores; and this
 wearing disturbs the face of the strata made by the layers of
 shells, which lie on the surface of the marine mud, and which were
 produced there when the salt waters covered them; and these strata
 were covered over again from time to time, with mud of various
 thickness, or carried down to the sea by the rivers and floods of
 more or less extent; and thus these layers of mud became raised to
 such a height, that they came up from the bottom to the air. At the
 present time these bottoms are so high that they form hills or high
 mountains, and the rivers, which wear away the sides of these
 mountains, uncover the strata of these shells, and thus the softened
 side of the earth continually rises and the antipodes sink closer to
 the centre of the earth, and the ancient bottoms of the seas have
 become mountain ridges.
