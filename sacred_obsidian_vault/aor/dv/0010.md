 I know that many will call this useless work  <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">7</font></a>
 ; and they
 will be those of whom Demetrius  <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">8</font></a>
  declared
 that he took no more
 </p><p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>
 <p>account of the wind that came out their mouth
 in words, than of that they expelled from their lower parts: men who
 desire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that
 of wisdom, which is the food and the only true riches of the mind.
 For so much more worthy as the soul is than the body, so much more
 noble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body. And
 often, when I see one of these men take this work in his hand, I
 wonder that he does not put it to his nose, like a monkey, or ask me
 if it is something good to eat.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
 <p>
 I am fully concious that, not being a literary man, certain
 presumptuous persons will think that they may reasonably blame me;
 alleging that I am not a man of letters. Foolish folks! do they not
 know that I might retort as Marius did to the Roman Patricians
  <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">10</font></a>
  by saying: That they, who deck
 themselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own.
 They will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly
 express that which I desire to treat of  <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">11</font></a>
 ; but they
 do not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience
 rather than by words  <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">12</font></a>
 ; and
 [experience] has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so,
 as mistress, I will cite her in all cases.

 <p><a name="fn_9"></a><a href="0010.htm#fr_9">13:7</a> : 3. questa
 essere opera inutile. By opera we must here understand libro di
 pittura and particularly the treatise on Perspective.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_10"></a><a href="0010.htm#fr_10">13:8</a> : 4. Demetrio. "With regard
 to the passage attributed to Demetrius", Dr. H. MÜLLER STRÜBING
 writes, "I know not what to make of it. It is certainly not
 Demetrius Phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be Demetrius
 Poliorcetes. Who then can it be--for the name is a very common one?
 It may be a clerical error for Demades and the maxim is quite in the
 spirit of his writings I have not however been able to find any
 corresponding passage either in the 'Fragments' (C. MULLER, <i>Orat.
 Att.</i>, II. 441) nor in the Supplements collected by DIETZ (<i>Rhein.
 Mus.</i>, vol. 29, p. 108)."
 </p><p>
 The same passage occurs as a simple Memorandum in the MS. Tr. 57,
 apparently as a note for this '<i>Proemio</i>' thus affording some data
 as to the time where these introductions were written.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_11"></a><a href="0010.htm#fr_11">14:9</a> : In the original, the Proemio dì prospettiva cioè
 dell'uffitio dell'occhio (see No. 21) stands between this and the
 preceding one, No. 9.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_12"></a><a href="0010.htm#fr_12">14:10</a>  21: <i>Come Mario disse ai patriti Romani</i>. "I am unable to
 find the words here attributed by Leonardo to Marius, either in
 Plutarch's Life of Marius or in the Apophthegmata (<i>Moralia</i>,
 p.202). Nor do they occur in the writings of Valerius Maximus (who
 frequently mentions Marius) nor in Velleius Paterculus (II, 11 to
 43), Dio Cassius, Aulus Gellius, or Macrobius. Professor E.
 MENDELSON of Dorpat, the editor of Herodian, assures me that no such
 passage is the found in that author" (communication from Dr. MULLER
 STRUBING). Leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known
 incident in Roman history and the mention of Marius is the result
 probably of some confusion. We may perhaps read, for Marius,
 Menenius Agrippa, though in that case it is true we must alter
 Patriti to Plebei. The change is a serious one. but it would render
 the passage perfectly clear.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_13"></a><a href="0010.htm#fr_13">14:11</a>  26: <i>le mie cose
 .... che d'altra parola</i>. This can hardly be reconciled with Mons.
 RAVAISSON'S estimate of L. da Vinci's learning. "<i>Leonard de Vinci
 etait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens, aussi bien dans
 l'art que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux
 yeux de la posterite.</i>" <i>Gaz. des Beaux arts</i>. Oct. 1877.</p>
