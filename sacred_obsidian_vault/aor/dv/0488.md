 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The necessity of anatomical knowledge (488. 489).</font></span>It is indispensable to a Painter who would be thoroughly familiar
 with the limbs in all the positions and actions of which they are
 capable, in the nude, to know the anatomy of the sinews, bones,
 muscles and tendons so that, in their various movements and
 exertions, he may know which nerve or muscle is the cause of each
 movement and show those only as prominent and thickened, and not the
 others all over [the limb], as many do who, to seem great
 draughtsmen, draw their nude figures looking like wood, devoid of
 grace; so that you would think you were looking at a sack of walnuts
 rather than the human form, or a bundle of radishes rather than the
 muscles of figures.
