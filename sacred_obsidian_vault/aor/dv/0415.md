 <p>
 The thickness of a branch never diminishes within the space between
 one leaf and the next excepting by so much as the thickness of the
 bud which is above the leaf and this thickness is taken off from the
 branch above [the node] as far as the next leaf.

 <p>
 Nature has so placed the leaves of the latest shoots of many plants
 that the sixth leaf is always above the first, and so on in
 succession, if the rule is not [accidentally] interfered with; and
 this occurs for two useful ends in the plant: First that as the
 shoot and the fruit of the following year spring from the bud or eye
 which lies above and in close contact with the insertion of the leaf
 [in the axil], the water which falls upon the shoot can run down to
 nourish the bud, by the drop being caught in the hollow [axil] at
 the insertion of the leaf. And the second advantage is, that as
 these shoots develop in the following year one will not cover the
 next below, since the 5 come forth on five different sides; and the
 sixth which is above the first is at some distance.
