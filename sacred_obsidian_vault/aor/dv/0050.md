 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Definition of Perspective.</font></span>[Drawing is based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a
 thorough knowledge of the function of the eye. And this function
 simply
 </p><p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>
 <p>consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of
 all the objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there
 is no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where
 these pyramids are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend
 the lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will
 bring them to a single point, and necessarily the said lines must
 form a pyramid.]

 [Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied
 to the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit
 their image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The <i>Pyramid</i> is
 the name I apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and
 edges of each object, converge from a distance and meet in a single
 point.]

 [Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may
 practically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own
 image, by lines forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.]
 </p><p>
 Perspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms
 that every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines;
 and bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or
 smaller size, according to the difference in their distance, one
 from the other. By a pyramid of lines I mean those which start from
 the surface and edges of bodies, and, converging from a distance
 meet in a single point. A point is said to be that which [having no
 dimensions] cannot be divided, and this point placed in the eye
 receives all the points of the cone.

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_29"></a><a href="0050.htm#fr_29">30:27</a> : 50. 1-5. Compare with this the Proem. No. 21. The
 paragraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9, 10-14, and 17--20, are
 evidently mere sketches and, as such, were cancelled by the writer;
 but they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph, lines 22-29.</p>
