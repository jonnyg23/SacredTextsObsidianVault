 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF DRAWING FROM RELIEF.</h3>
 <p>
 In drawing from the round the draughtsman should so place himself
 that the eye of the figure he is drawing is on a level with his own.
 This should be done with any head he may have to represent from
 nature because, without exception, the figures or persons you meet
 in the streets have their eyes on the same level as your own; and if
 you place them higher or lower you will see that your drawing will
 not be true.
