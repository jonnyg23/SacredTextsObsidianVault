 </p><h3 align="CENTER">WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHADOW THAT IS INSEPARABLE FROM A BODY AND A CAST SHADOW?</h3>
 <p>
 An inseparable shadow is that which is never absent from the
 illuminated body. As, for instance a ball, which so long as it is in
 the light always has one side in shadow which never leaves it for
 any movement or change of position in the ball. A separate shadow
 may be and may not be produced by the body itself. Suppose the ball
 to be one braccia distant from a wall with a light on the opposite
 side of it; this light will throw upon the wall exactly as broad a
 shadow as is to be seen on the side of the ball that is turned
 towards the wall. That portion of the cast shadow will not be
 visible when the light is below the ball and the shadow is thrown up
 towards the sky and finding no obstruction on its way is lost.
