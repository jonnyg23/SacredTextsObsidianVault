 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO DRAW WITH COMPANIONS OR NOT.</h3>
 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The distribution of time for studying (495-497).</font></span>I say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone,
 for many reasons. The first is that you would be ashamed to be seen
 behindhand among the students, and such shame will lead you to
 careful study. Secondly, a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to
 be among those who are more praised than yourself, and this praise
 of others will spur you on. Another is that you can learn from the
 drawings of others who do better than yourself; and if you are
 better than they, you can profit by your contempt for their defects,
 while the praise of others will incite you to farther merits.

 <p><a name="fn_242"></a><a href="0495.htm#fr_242">249:240</a> : The contradiction by this passage of the foregoing
 chapter is only apparent. It is quite clear, from the nature of the
 reasoning which is here used to prove that it is more improving to
 work with others than to work alone, that the studies of pupils only
 are under consideration here.</p>
