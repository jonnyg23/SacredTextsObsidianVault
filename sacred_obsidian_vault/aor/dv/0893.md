 <p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE MOON AND WHETHER IT IS POLISHED AND SPHERICAL.</h3>
 <p>
 The image of the sun in the moon is powerfully luminous, and is only
 on a small portion of its surface. And the proof may be seen by
 taking a ball of burnished gold and placing it in the dark with a
 light at some distance from it; and then, although it will
 illuminate about half of the ball, the eye will perceive its
 reflection only in a small part of its surface, and all the rest of
 the surface reflects the darkness which surrounds it; so that it is
 only in that spot that the image of the light is seen, and all the
 rest remains invisible, the eye being at a distance from the ball.
 The same thing would happen on the surface of the moon if it were
 polished, lustrous and opaque, like all bodies with a reflecting
 surface.

 Show how, if you were standing on the moon or on a star, our earth
 would seem to reflect the sun as the moon does.
 </p><p>
 And show that the image of the sun in the sea cannot appear one and
 undivided, as it appears in a perfectly plane mirror.
