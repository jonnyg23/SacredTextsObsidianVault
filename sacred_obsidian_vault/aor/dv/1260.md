 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</h3>
 <p>

 or where there may be the remains of canes that have been

 <p>split, and it rubs against them till a vein is opened; then when the blood has
 flowed as much as he needs, he plasters himself with mud and heals
 the wound. In form he is something like a horse with long haunches,
 a twisted tail and the teeth of a wild boar, his neck has a mane;
 the skin cannot be pierced, unless when he is bathing; he feeds on
 plants in the fields and goes into them backwards so that it may
 seem, as though he had come out.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE IBIS.</h3>
 <p>
 This bird resembles a crane, and when it feels itself ill it fills
 its craw with water, and with its beak makes an injection of it.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE STAG.</h3>
 <p>
 These creatures when they feel themselves bitten by the spider
 called father-long-legs, eat crabs and free themselves of the venom.
