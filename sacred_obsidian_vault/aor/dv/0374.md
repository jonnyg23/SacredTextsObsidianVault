 When a man who is running wants to neutralise the impetus that
 carries him on he prepares a contrary impetus which is generated by
 his hanging backwards. This can be proved, since, if the impetus
 carries a moving body with a momentum equal to 4 and the moving body
 wants to turn and fall back with a momentum of 4, then one momentum
 neutralises the other contrary one, and the impetus is neutralised.
