 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF LIGHT.</h3>
 <p>
 The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These
 are: diffused light as that of the atmosphere, within our horizon.
 And Direct, as that of the sun, or of a window or door or other
 opening. The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is
 that which passes through [semi] transparent bodies, as linen or
 paper or the like, but not transparent like glass, or crystal, or
 other diaphanous bodies, which produce the same effect as though
 nothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that
 falls upon it; and this we will discuss fully in our discourse.
