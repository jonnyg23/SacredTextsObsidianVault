 That the flow and ebb are not general; for on the shore at Genoa
 there is none, at Venice two braccia, between England and Flanders
 18 braccia. That in the straits of Sicily the current is very strong
 because all the waters from the rivers that flow into the Adriatic
 pass there.

 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="0959.htm#fr_171">194:505</a> : A few more recent data may be given here to facilitate
 comparison. In the Adriatic the tide rises 2 and 1/2 feet, at
 Terracina 1 1/4. In the English channel between Calais and Kent it
 rises from 18 to 20 feet. In the straits of Messina it rises no more
 than 2 1/2 feet, and that only in stormy weather, but the current is
 all the stronger. When Leonardo accounts for this by the southward
 flow of all the Italian rivers along the coasts, the explanation is
 at least based on a correct observation; namely that a steady
 current flows southwards along the coast of Calabria and another
 northwards, along the shores of Sicily; he seems to infer, from the
 direction of the fust, that the tide in the Adriatic is caused by
 it.</p>
