 Take in each hand an equal number; put 4 from the right hand into
 the left; cast away the remainder; cast away an equal number from
 the left hand; add 5, and now you will find 13 in this [left] hand;
 that is--I made you put 4 from the right hand into the left, and cast
 away the remainder; now your right hand has 4 more; then I make you
 throw away as many from the right as you threw away from the left;
 so, throwing from each hand a quantity of which the remainder may be
 equal, you now have 4 and 4, which make 8, and that the trick may
 not be detected I made you put 5 more, which made 13.

 Take any number less than 12 that you please; then take of mine
 enough to make up the number 12, and that which remains to me is the
 number which you at first had; because when I said, take any number
 less than 12 as you please, I took 12 into my hand, and of that 12
 you took such a number as made up your number of 12; and what you
 added to your number, you took from mine; that is, if you had 8 to
 go as far as to 12, you took of my 12, 4; hence this

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> 4 transferred
 from me to you reduced my 12 to a remainder of 8, and your 8 became
 12; so that my 8 is equal to your 8, before it was made 12.
