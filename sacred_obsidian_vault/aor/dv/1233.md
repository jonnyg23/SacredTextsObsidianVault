 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PRIDE.</h3>
 <p>
 The falcon, by reason of its haughtiness and pride, is fain to lord
 it and rule over all the other birds of prey, and longs to be sole
 and supreme; and very often the falcon has been seen to assault the
 eagle, the Queen of birds.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ABSTINENCE.</h3>
 <p>
 The wild ass, when it goes to the well to drink, and finds the water
 troubled, is never so thirsty but that it will abstain from
 drinking, and wait till the water is clear again.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">GLUTTONY.</h3>
 <p>
 The vulture is so addicted to gluttony that it will go a thousand
 miles to eat a carrion [carcase]; therefore is it that it follows
 armies.
