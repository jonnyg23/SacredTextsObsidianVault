 <p>few whom his vices have disgusted, and he only dislikes those men
 whose natures are contrary to those vices. And many hate their
 fathers, and break off friendship with those who reprove their
 vices; and he will not permit any examples against them, nor any
 advice.

 If you meet with any one who is virtuous do not drive him from you;
 do him honour, so that he may not have to flee from you and be
 reduced to hiding in hermitages, or caves or other solitary places
 to escape from your treachery; if there is such an one among you do
 him honour, for these are our Saints upon earth; these are they who
 deserve statues from us, and images; but remember that their images
 are not to be eaten by you, as is still done in some parts of India

  where, when the
 images have according to them, performed some miracle, the priests
 cut them in pieces, being of wood, and give them to all the people
 of the country, not without payment; and each one grates his portion
 very fine, and puts it upon the first food he eats; and thus
 believes that by faith he has eaten his saint who then preserves him
 from all perils. What do you think here, Man, of your own species?
 Are you so wise as you believe yourselves to be? Are these things to
 be done by men?

 <p><a name="fn_383"></a><a href="1358.htm#fr_383">412:689</a> : Below this text we read gusstino--Giustino and in another
 passage on the same page Justin is quoted (No. 1210, 1. 48). The two
 have however no real connection.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_384"></a><a href="1358.htm#fr_384">413:690</a>  15: In explanation of this passage I have received the
 following communication from Dr. G. W. LEITNER of Lahore: "So far as
 Indian customs are known to us, this practice spoken of by Leonardo
 as 'still existing in some parts of India' is perfectly unknown; and
 it is equally opposed to the spirit of Hinduism, Mohammedanism and
 Sikhism. In central Thibet the ashes of the dead, when burnt, are
 mixed with dough, and small figures--usually of Buddha--are stamped
 out of them and some are laid in the grave while others are
 distributed among the relations. The custom spoken of by Leonardo
 may have prevailed there but I never heard of it." Possibly Leonardo
 refers here to customs of nations of America.</p>
