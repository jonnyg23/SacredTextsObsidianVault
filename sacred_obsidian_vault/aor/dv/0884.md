 Poseidonius of Apamea, commonly called the Rhodian, because he
 taught in Rhodes, was a Stoic philosopher, a contemporary and friend
 of Cicero's, and the author of numerous works on natural science,
 among them.

 Strabo quotes no doubt from one of his works, when he says that
 Poseidonius explained how it was that the sun looked larger when it
 was rising or setting than during the rest of its course (III, p.
 135). Kleomedes, a later Greek Naturalist also mentions this
 observation of Poseidonius' without naming the title of his work;
 however, as Kleomedes' Cyclia Theorica was not printed till 1535,
 Leonardo must have derived his quotation from Strabo. He probably
 wrote this note in 1508, and as the original Greek was first printed
 in Venice in 1516, we must suppose him to quote here from the
 translation by Guarinus Veronensis, which was printed as early as
 1471, also at Venice (H. MULLER-STRUBING).</p>
