 <p>
 A priest, making the rounds of his parish on Easter Eve, and
 sprinkling holy water in the houses as is customary, came to a
 painter's room, where he sprinkled the water on some of his
 pictures. The painter turned round, somewhat angered, and asked him
 why this sprinkling had been bestowed on his pictures; then said the
 priest, that it was the custom and his duty to do so, and that he
 was doing good; and that he who did good might look for good in
 return, and, indeed, for better, since God had promised that every
 good deed that was done on earth should be rewarded a hundred-fold
 from above. Then the painter, waiting till he went out, went to an
 upper window and flung a large pail of water on the priest's back,
 saying: "Here is the reward a hundred-fold from above, which you
 said would come from the good you had done me with your holy water,
 by which you have damaged my pictures."
