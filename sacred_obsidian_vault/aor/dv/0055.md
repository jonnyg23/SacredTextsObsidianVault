 All objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the
 nearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller

 <p>will the image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may
 intersect the pyramid with a vertical plane  <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="#fn_31"><font size="1">29</font></a>
  which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown
 in the plane <i>a n</i>.

 The eye <i>f</i> and the eye <i>t</i> are one and the same thing; but the eye
 <i>f</i> marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from
 the object; and the eye <i>t</i> shows you the direction of it; that is
 whether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the
 object you are looking at. And remember that the eye <i>f</i> and the eye
 <i>t</i> must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise
 or lower the eye from the distance point <i>f</i> you must do the same
 with the direction point <i>t</i>. And if the point <i>f</i> shows how far the
 eye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which
 </p><p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>
 <p>side it is placed--and, if in the same way, the point <i>t</i> show <i>s</i> the
 direction and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must
 use both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).</font></span><i>f</i> could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to
 the distance between <i>s</i> and <i>c</i>, and if at the nearest end of the
 side towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight
 object, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at <i>r s</i>--then, I
 say, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is
 nearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane <i>r
 s</i>, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at
 the height of the point <i>n</i> on the vertical plane. Thus, by this
 example, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of
 objects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more
 remote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the
 eye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which
 your feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into
 infinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in
 itself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which
 convey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always
 coincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all
 we can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as
 the diminishing point

 Compare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer
 exclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of
 this it should be observed that <i>c s</i> must be regarded as
 representing the section or profile of a square plane, placed
 horizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word <i>pianura</i>
 is subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain
 preliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the
 diagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.
 Leonardo's mistake in writing <i>t denota</i> (line 6) for <i>f denota</i> has
 been rectified.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_32"></a><a href="0055.htm#fr_32">35:30</a> : The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the
 first five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred
 to in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to
 remark.</p>
