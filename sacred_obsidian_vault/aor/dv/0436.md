 That part of the trees will be seen to lie in the least dark shadow
 which is farthest from the earth.

 To prove it let <i>a p</i> be the tree, <i>n b c</i> the illuminated
 hemisphere [the sky], the under portion of the tree faces the earth
 <i>p c</i>, that is on the side <i>o</i>, and it faces a small part of the
 hemisphere at <i>c d</i>. But the highest part of the convexity a faces
 the greatest part of the hemisphere, that is <i>b c</i>. For this
 reason--and because it does not face the darkness of the earth--it
 is in fuller light. But if the tree has dense foliage, as the
 laurel, arbutus, box or holm oak, it will be different; because,
 although <i>a</i> does not face the earth, it faces the dark [green] of
 the leaves cut up by many shadows, and this darkness is reflected
 onto the under sides of the leaves immediately above. Thus these
 trees have their darkest shadows nearest to the middle of the tree.
