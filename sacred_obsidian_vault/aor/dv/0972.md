 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the alterations, caused in the courses of rivers by their confluence (972-974).</font></span>When a smaller river pours its waters into a larger one, and that
 larger one flows from the opposite direction, the course of the
 smaller river will bend up against the approach of the larger river;
 and this happens because, when the larger river fills up all its bed
 with water, it makes an eddy in front of the mouth of the other
 river, and so carries the water poured in by the smaller river with
 its own. When the smaller river pours its waters into the larger
 one, which runs across the current at the mouth of the smaller
 river, its waters will bend with the downward movement of the larger
 river.  <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">514</font></a>
