 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THAT THE OCEAN DOES NOT PENETRATE UNDER THE EARTH.</h3>
 <p>
 The ocean does not penetrate under the earth, and this we learn from
 the many and various springs of fresh water which, in many parts of
 the ocean make their way up from the bottom to the surface. The same
 thing is farther proved by wells dug beyond the distance of a mile
 from the said ocean, which fill with fresh water; and this happens
 because the fresh water is lighter than salt water and consequently
 more penetrating.

 Which weighs most, water when frozen or when not frozen?

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">FRESH WATER PENETRATES MORE AGAINST SALT WATER THAN SALT WATER AGAINST FRESH WATER.</h3>
 <p>
 That fresh water penetrates more against salt water, than salt water
 against fresh is proved by a thin cloth dry and old, hanging with
 the two opposite ends equally low in the two different waters, the
 surfaces of which are at an equal level; and it will then be seen
 how much higher the fresh water will rise in this piece of linen
 than the salt; by so much is the fresh lighter than the salt.
