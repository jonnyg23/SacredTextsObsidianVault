 In general almost all the upright portions of trees curve somewhat
 turning the convexity towards the South; and their branches are
 longer and thicker and more abundant towards the South than towards
 the North. And this occurs because the sun draws the sap towards
 that surface of the tree which is nearest to it.

 And this may be observed if the sun is not screened off by other
 plants.
