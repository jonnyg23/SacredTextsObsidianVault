 </p><h3 align="CENTER">LAKE OF COMO. VALLEY OF CHIAVENNA.</h3>
 <p>
 Above the lake of Como towards Germany is the valley of Chiavenna
 where the river Mera flows into this lake. Here are barren and very
 high mountains, with huge rocks. Among these mountains are to be
 found the water-birds called gulls. Here grow fir trees, larches and
 pines. Deer, wildgoats, chamois, and terrible bears. It is
 impossible to climb them without using hands and feet. The peasants
 go there at the time of the snows with great snares to make the
 bears fall down these rocks. These mountains which very closely
 approach each other are parted by the river. They are to the right
 and left for the distance of 20 miles throughout of the same nature.
 From mile to mile there are good inns. Above on the said river there
 are waterfalls of 400 braccia in height, which are fine to see; and
 there is good living at 4 soldi the reckoning. This river brings
 down a great deal of timber.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">VAL SASINA.</h3>
 <p>
 Val Sasina runs down towards Italy; this is almost the same form and
 character. There grow here many <i>mappello</i> and there are great ruins
 and falls of water  <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_219"><font size="1">553</font></a>

 <p></p><h3 align="CENTER">VALLEY OF INTROZZO.</h3>
 <p>
 This valley produces a great quantity of firs, pines and larches;
 and from here Ambrogio Fereri has his timber brought down; at the
 head of the Valtellina are the mountains of Bormio, terrible and
 always covered with snow; marmots (?) are found there.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">BELLAGGIO.</h3>
 <p>
 Opposite the castle Bellaggio there is the river Latte, which falls
 from a height of more than 100 braccia from the source whence it
 springs, perpendicularly, into the lake with an inconceivable roar
 and noise. This spring flows only in August and September.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">VALTELLINA.</h3>
 <p>
 Valtellina, as it is called, is a valley enclosed in high and
 terrible mountains; it produces much strong wine, and there is so
 much cattle that the natives conclude that more milk than wine grows
 there. This is the valley through which the Adda passes, which first
 runs more than 40 miles through Germany; this river breeds the fish
 <i>temolo</i> which live on silver, of which much is to be found in its
 sands. In this country every one can sell bread and wine, and the
 wine is worth at most one soldo the bottle and a pound of veal one
 soldo, and salt ten dinari and butter the same and their pound is 30
 ounces, and eggs are one soldo the lot.
