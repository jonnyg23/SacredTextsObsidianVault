 All communities obey and are led by their magnates, and these
 magnates ally themselves with the lords and subjugate them in two
 ways: either by consanguinity, or by fortune; by consanguinity, when
 their children are, as it were, hostages, and a security and pledge
 of their suspected fidelity; by property, when you make each of
 these build a house or two inside your city which may yield some
 revenue and he shall have...; 10 towns, five thousand houses with
 thirty thousand inhabitants, and you will disperse this great
 congregation of people which stand like goats one behind the other,
 filling every place with fetid smells and sowing seeds of pestilence
 and death;
 </p><p>
 And the city will gain beauty worthy of its name and to you it will
 be useful by its revenues, and the eternal fame of its
 aggrandizement.
