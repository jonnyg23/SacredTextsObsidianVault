 <p>
 (Of going in Ships.)
 </p><p>
 We shall see the trees of the great forests of Taurus and of Sinai
 and of the Appenines and others, rush by means of the air, from East
 to West and from North to South; and carry, by means of the air,
 great multitudes of men. Oh! how many vows! Oh! how many deaths! Oh!
 how many partings of friends and relations! Oh! how many will those
 be who will never again see their own country nor their native land,
 and who will die unburied, with their bones strewn in various parts
 of the world!
 </p><p>
 (Of moving on All Saints' Day.)
 </p><p>
 Many will forsake their own dwellings and carry with them all their
 belongings and will go to live in other parts.
 </p><p>
 (Of All Souls' Day.)
 </p><p>
 How many will they be who will bewail their deceased forefathers,
 carrying lights to them.
 </p><p>
 (Of Friars, who spending nothing but words, receive great gifts and
 bestow Paradise.)
 </p><p>
 Invisible money will procure the triumph of many who will spend it.
 </p><p>
 (Of Bows made of the Horns of Oxen.)
 </p><p>
 Many will there be who will die a painful death by means of the
 horns of cattle.
 </p><p>
 (Of writing Letters from one Country to another.)
 </p><p>
 Men will speak with each other from the most remote countries, and
 reply.
 </p><p>
 (Of Hemispheres, which are infinite; and which are divided by an
 infinite number of Lines, so that every Man always has one of these
 Lines between his Feet.)
 </p><p>
 Men standing in opposite hemispheres will converse and deride each
 other and embrace each other, and understand each other's language.

 (Of Priests who say Mass.)
 </p><p>
 There will be many men who, when they go to their labour will put on
 the richest clothes, and these will be made after the fashion of
 aprons [petticoats].
 </p><p>
 (Of Friars who are Confessors.)
 </p><p>
 And unhappy women will, of their own free will, reveal to men all
 their sins and shameful and most secret deeds.
 </p><p>
 (Of Churches and the Habitations of Friars.)
 </p><p>
 Many will there be who will give up work and labour and poverty of
 life and goods, and will go to live among wealth in splendid
 buildings, declaring that this is the way to make themselves
 acceptable to God.
 </p><p>
 (Of Selling Paradise.)
 </p><p>
 An infinite number of men will sell publicly and unhindered things
 of the very highest price, without leave from the Master of it;
 while it never was theirs nor in their power; and human justice will
 not prevent it.
 </p><p>
 (Of the Dead which are carried to be buried.)
 </p><p>
 The simple folks will carry vast quantities of lights to light up
 the road for those who have entirely lost the power of sight.
 </p><p>
 (Of Dowries for Maidens.)
 </p><p>
 And whereas, at first, maidens could not be protected against the
 violence of Men, neither by the watchfulness of parents nor by
 strong walls, the time will come when the fathers and parents of
 those girls will pay a large price to a man who wants to marry them,
 even if they are rich, noble and most handsome. Certainly this seems
 as though nature wished to eradicate the human race as being useless
 to the world, and as spoiling all created things.
 </p><p>
 (Of the Cruelty of Man.)
 </p><p>
 Animals will be seen on the earth who will always be fighting
 against each other
 </p><p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p>
 <p>with the greatest loss and frequent deaths on
 each side. And there will be no end to their malignity; by their
 strong limbs we shall see a great portion of the trees of the vast
 forests laid low throughout the universe; and, when they are filled
 with food the satisfaction of their desires will be to deal death
 and grief and labour and wars and fury to every living thing; and
 from their immoderate pride they will desire to rise towards heaven,
 but the too great weight of their limbs will keep them down. Nothing
 will remain on earth, or under the earth or in the waters which will
 not be persecuted, disturbed and spoiled, and those of one country
 removed into another. And their bodies will become the sepulture and
 means of transit of all they have killed.
 </p><p>
 O Earth! why dost thou not open and engulf them in the fissures of
 thy vast abyss and caverns, and no longer display in the sight of
 heaven such a cruel and horrible monster.
