 If you cannot arrange that those who look at your work should stand
 at one particular point, when constructing your work, stand back
 until your eye is at least 20 times as far off as the greatest
 height and width of your work. This will make so little difference
 when the eye of the spectator moves, that it will be hardly
 appreciable, and it will look very good.

 If the point of sight is at <i>t</i> you would make the figures on the
 circle <i>d b e</i> all
 </p><p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>
 <p>of one size, as each of them bears the same
 relation to the point <i>t</i>. But consider the diagram given below and
 you will see that this is wrong, and why I shall make <i>b</i> smaller
 than <i>d e</i>  <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">258</font></a>
 .

 It is easy to understand that if 2 objects equal to each other are
 placed side by side the one at 3 braccia distance looks smaller than
 that placed at 2 braccia. This however is rather theoretical than
 for practice, because you stand close by  <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">259</font></a>
 .
 </p><p>
 All the objects in the foreground, whether large or small, are to be
 drawn of their proper size, and if you see them from a distance they
 will appear just as they ought, and if you see them close they will
 diminish of themselves.
 </p><p>
  <a name="fr_262"></a><a href="#fn_262"><font size="1">260</font></a>
  Take care that the vertical
 plan on which you work out the perspective of the objects seen is of
 the same form as the wall on which the work is to be executed.
