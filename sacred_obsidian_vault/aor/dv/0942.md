 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The relative height of the surface of the sea to that of the land (942-945).</font></span><i>b d</i> is a plain through which a river flows to the sea; this plain
 ends at the sea, and since in fact the dry land that is uncovered is
 not perfectly level--for, if it were, the river would have no
 motion--as the river does move, this place is a slope rather than a
 plain; hence this plain <i>d b</i> so ends where the sphere of water
 begins that if it were extended in a continuous line to <i>b a</i> it
 would go down beneath the sea, whence it follows that the sea <i>a c
 b</i> looks higher than the dry land.
 </p><p>
 Obviously no portions of dry land left uncovered by water can ever
 be lower than the surface of the watery sphere.
