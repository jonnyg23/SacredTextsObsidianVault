 <p><a name="fn_137"></a><a href="0313.htm#fr_137">171:135</a> : See <a href="pl007.htm#img_pl007">Pl. VII</a>, No. 3. Reference may also be made here to
 two pen and ink drawings of heads in profile with figured
 measurements, of which there is no description in the MS. These are
 given on <a href="pl017.htm#img_pl017">Pl. XVII</a>, No. 2.--A head, to the left, with part of the
 torso [W. P. 5a], No. 1 on the same plate is from MS. A 2b and in
 the original occurs on a page with wholly irrelevant text on matters
 of natural history. M. RAVAISSON in his edition of the Paris MS. A
 has reproduced this head and discussed it fully [note on page 12];
 he has however somewhat altered the original measurements. The
 complicated calculations which M. RAVAISSON has given appear to me
 in no way justified. The sketch, as we see it, can hardly have been
 intended for any thing more than an experimental attempt to
 ascertain relative proportions. We do not find that Leonardo made
 use of circular lines in any other study of the proportions of the
 human head. At the same time we see that the proportions of this
 sketch are not in accordance with the rules which he usually
 observed (see for instance No. 310).</p>
