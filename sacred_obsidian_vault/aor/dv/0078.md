 Necessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of
 the eye shall intersect in two places. One of these intersections is
 in the pupil, the other in the crystalline lens; and if this were
 not the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as
 it does. This can be proved, since all the lines which intersect do
 so in a point. Because nothing is seen of objects excepting their
 surface; and their edges are lines, in contradistinction to the
 definition of a surface. And each minute part of a line is equal to
 a point; for <i>smallest</i> is said of that than which nothing can be
 smaller, and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the
 point. Hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle
 to transmit its image to the point of intersection, as is shown in
 the 4th of this which shows: all the smallest parts of the images
 cross each

 other without interfering with each other. These
 demonstrations are to illustrate the eye. No image, even of the
 smallest object, enters the eye without being turned upside down;
 but as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more
 reversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within
 the eye as that of the object outside the eye.
