 The hapless willow, finding that she could not enjoy the pleasure of
 seeing her slender branches grow or attain to the height she wished,
 or point to the sky, by reason of the vine and whatever other trees
 that grew near, but was always maimed and lopped and spoiled,
 brought all her spirits together and gave and devoted itself
 entirely to imagination, standing plunged in long meditation and
 seeking, in all the world of plants, with which of them she might
 ally herself and which could not need the help of her withes. Having
 stood for some time in this prolific imagination, with a sudden
 flash the gourd presented itself to her thoughts and tossing all her
 branches with extreme delight, it seemed to her that she had found
 the companion suited to her purpose, because the gourd is more apt
 to bind others than to need binding; having come to this conclusion

 <p>she awaited eagerly some friendly bird who should be the mediator of
 her wishes. Presently seeing near her the magpie she said to him: "O
 gentle bird! by the memory of the refuge which you found this
 morning among my branches, when the hungry cruel, and rapacious
 falcon wanted to devour you, and by that repose which you have
 always found in me when your wings craved rest, and by the pleasure
 you have enjoyed among my boughs, when playing with your companions
 or making love--I entreat you find the gourd and obtain from her
 some of her seeds, and tell her that those that are born of them I
 will treat exactly as though they were my own flesh and blood; and
 in this way use all the words you can think of, which are of the
 same persuasive purport; though, indeed, since you are a master of
 language, I need not teach you. And if you will do me this service I
 shall be happy to have your nest in the fork of my boughs, and all
 your family without payment of any rent." Then the magpie, having
 made and confirmed certain new stipulations with the willow,--and
 principally that she should never admit upon her any snake or
 polecat, cocked his tail, and put down his head, and flung himself
 from the bough, throwing his weight upon his wings; and these,
 beating the fleeting air, now here, now there, bearing about
 inquisitively, while his tail served as a rudder to steer him, he
 came to a gourd; then with a handsome bow and a few polite words, he
 obtained the required seeds, and carried them to the willow, who
 received him with a cheerful face. And when he had scraped away with
 his foot a small quantity of the earth near the willow, describing a
 circle, with his beak he planted the grains, which in a short time
 began to grow, and by their growth and the branches to take up all
 the boughs of the willow, while their broad leaves deprived it of
 the beauty of the sun and sky. And not content with so much evil,
 the gourds next began, by their rude hold, to drag the ends of the
 tender shoots down towards the earth, with strange twisting and
 distortion.

 Then, being much annoyed, it shook itself in vain to throw off the
 gourd. After raving for some days in such plans vainly, because the
 firm union forbade it, seeing the wind come by it commended itself
 to him. The wind flew hard and opened the old and hollow stem of the
 willow in two down to the roots, so that it fell into two parts. In
 vain did it bewail itself recognising that it was born to no good
 end.
