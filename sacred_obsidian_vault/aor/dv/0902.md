 No solid body is less heavy than the atmosphere.

 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Explanation of the lumen cinereum in the moon.</font></span>Having proved that the part of the moon that shines consists of
 water, which mirrors the body of the sun and reflects the radiance
 it receives from it; and that, if these waters were devoid of waves,
 it would appear small, but of a radiance almost like the sun; --[5]
 It must now be shown whether the moon is a heavy or a light body:
 for, if it were a heavy body--admitting that at every grade of
 distance from the earth greater levity must prevail, so that water
 is lighter than the earth, and air than water, and fire than air and
 so on successively--it would seem that if the moon had density as it
 really has, it would have weight, and having weight, that it could
 not be sustained in the space

 where it is, and consequently that it
 would fall towards the centre of the universe and become united to
 the earth; or if not the moon itself, at least its waters would fall
 away and be lost from it, and descend towards the centre, leaving
 the moon without any and so devoid of lustre. But as this does not
 happen, as might in reason be expected, it is a manifest sign that
 the moon is surrounded by its own elements: that is to say water,
 air and fire; and thus is, of itself and by itself, suspended in
 that part of space, as our earth with its element is in this part of
 space; and that heavy bodies act in the midst of its elements just
 as other heavy bodies do in ours  <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">480</font></a>
 
 <p>
 When the eye is in the East and sees the moon in the West near to
 the setting sun, it sees it with its shaded portion surrounded by
 luminous portions; and the lateral and upper portion of this light
 is derived from the sun, and the lower portion from the ocean in the
 West, which receives the solar rays and reflects them on the lower
 waters of the moon, and indeed affords the part of the moon that is
 in shadow as much radiance as the moon gives the earth at midnight.
 Therefore it is not totally dark, and hence some have believed that
 the moon must in parts have a light of its own besides that which is
 given it by the sun; and this light is due, as has been said, to the
 above- mentioned cause,--that our seas are illuminated by the sun.
 </p><p>
 Again, it might be said that the circle of radiance
 </p><p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p align="CENTER"><a name="img_v216400"></a>

 shown by the
 moon when it and the sun are both in the West is wholly borrowed
 from the sun, when it, and the sun, and the eye are situated as is
 shown above.
 <p>
  <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">481</font></a>
 
 </p><p>
 Some might say that the air surrounding the moon as an element,
 catches the light of the sun as our atmosphere does, and that it is
 this which completes the luminous circle on the body of the moon.
 </p><p>
 Some have thought that the moon has a light of its own, but this
 opinion is false, because they have founded it on that dim light
 seen between the hornes of the new moon, which looks dark where it
 is close to the bright part, while against the darkness of the
 background it looks so light that many have taken it to be a ring of
 new radiance completing the circle where the tips of the horns
 illuminated by the sun cease to shine  <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">482</font></a>
 . And this difference of background arises from the fact that
 the portion of that background which is conterminous with the bright
 part of the moon, by comparison with that brightness looks darker
 than it is; while at the upper part, where a portion of the luminous
 circle is to be seen of uniform width, the result is that the moon,
 being brighter there than the medium or background on which it is
 seen by comparison with that darkness it looks more luminous at that
 edge than it is. And that brightness at such a time itself is
 derived from our ocean and other inland-seas. These are, at that
 time, illuminated by the sun which is already setting in such a way
 as that the sea then fulfils the same function to the dark side of
 the moon as the moon at its fifteenth day does to us when the
 </p><p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165</font></a></p>
 <p>sun is
 set. And the small amount of light which the dark side of the moon
 receives bears the same proportion to the light of that side which
 is illuminated, as that...  <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">483</font></a>
 .
 </p><p>
 If you want to see how much brighter the shaded portion of the moon
 is than the background on which it is seen, conceal the luminous
 portion of the moon with your hand or with some other more distant
 object.

 tola--ferro stagnato</i> (tinned iron); <i>romantina</i> is some special
 kind of sheet-iron no longer known by that name.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_146"></a><a href="0902.htm#fr_146">163:480</a>  15: This passage would
 certainly seem to establish Leonardo's claim to be regarded as the
 original discoverer of the cause of the ashy colour of the new moon
 (<i>lumen cinereum</i>). His observations however, having hitherto
 remained unknown to astronomers, Moestlin and Kepler have been
 credited with the discoveries which they made independently a
 century later.

 Some disconnected notes treat of the same subject in MS. C. A. 239b;
 718b and 719b; "<i>Perche la luna cinta della parte alluminata dal
 sole in ponente, tra maggior splendore in mezzo a tal cerchio, che
 quando essa eclissava il sole. Questo accade perche nell' eclissare
 il sole ella ombrava il nostro oceano, il qual caso non accade
 essendo in ponente, quando il sole alluma esso oceano</i>." The editors
 of the "<i>Saggio</i>" who first published this passage (page 12) add
 another short one about the seasons in the moon which I confess not
 to have seen in the original manuscript: "<i>La luna ha ogni mese un
 verno e una state, e ha maggiori freddi e maggiori caldi, e i suoi
 equinozii son piu freddi de' nostri.</i>"</p>
