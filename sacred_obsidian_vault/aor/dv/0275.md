 <p>
 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> On the colours of derived shadows (275. 276).</font></span>Let <i>n</i> be the source of the shadow <i>e f</i>; it will assume its hue.
 Let <i>o</i> be the source of <i>h e</i> which will in the same way be tinged
 by its hue and so also the colour of <i>v h</i> will be affected by <i>p</i>
 which causes it; and the shadow of the triangle <i>z k y</i> will be
 affected by the colour of <i>q</i>, because it is produced by it. [7] In
 proportion as <i>c d</i> goes into <i>a d</i>, will <i>n r s</i> be darker than
 <i>m</i>; and the rest of the space will be shadowless [11]. <i>f g</i> is
 the highest light, because here the whole light of the window <i>a d</i>
 falls; and thus on the opaque body <i>m e</i> is in equally high light;
 <i>z k y</i> is a triangle which includes the
 </p><p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>
 <p>deepest shadow, because the
 light <i>a d</i> cannot reach any part of it. <i>x h</i> is the 2nd grade of
 shadow, because it receives only 1/3 of the light from the window,
 that is <i>c d</i>. The third grade of shadow is <i>h e</i>, where two thirds
 of the light from the window is visible. The last grade of shadow is
 <i>b d e f</i>, because the highest grade of light from the window falls
 at <i>f</i>.

 well as the text given in No. 148. Lines 7-11 (compare lines 8-12 of
 No. 148) which are written within the diagram, evidently apply to
 both sections and have therefore been inserted in both.</p>
