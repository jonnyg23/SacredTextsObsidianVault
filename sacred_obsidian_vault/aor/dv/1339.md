 <p>
 Like a whirling wind which rushes down a sandy and hollow valley,
 and which, in its hasty course, drives to its centre every thing
 that opposes its furious course ...
 </p><p>
 No otherwise does the Northern blast whirl round in its tempestuous
 progress ...

 Nor does the tempestuous sea bellow so loud, when the Northern blast
 dashes it, with its foaming waves between Scylla and Charybdis; nor
 Stromboli, nor Mount Etna, when their sulphurous flames, having been
 forcibly confined, rend, and burst open the mountain, fulminating
 stones and earth through the air together with the flames they
 vomit.
 </p><p>
 Nor when the inflamed caverns of Mount Etna  <a name="fr_366"></a><a href="#fn_366"><font size="1">672</font></a>
 ,
 rejecting the ill-restained element vomit it forth, back to its own
 region, driving furiously before it every obstacle that comes in the
 way of its impetuous rage ...
 </p><p>
 Unable to resist my eager desire and wanting to see the great ... of
 the various and strange shapes made by formative nature, and having
 wandered some distance among gloomy rocks, I came to the entrance of
 a great cavern, in front of which I stood some time, astonished and
 unaware of such a thing. Bending my back into an arch I rested my
 left hand on my knee and held my right hand over my down-cast and
 contracted eye brows: often bending first one way and then the
 other, to see whether I could discover anything inside, and this
 being forbidden by the deep darkness within, and after having
 remained there some time, two contrary emotions arose in me, fear
 and desire--fear of the threatening dark cavern, desire to see
 whether there were any marvellous thing within it ...

 <p><a name="fn_365"></a><a href="1339.htm#fr_365">394:671</a> : 1339. It may be inferred from the character of the writing,
 which is in the style of the note in facsimile Vol. I, p. 297, that
 this passage was written between 1470 and 1480. As the figure 6 at
 the end of the text indicates, it was continued on another page, but
 I have searched in vain for it. The reverse of this leaf is coloured
 red for drawing in silver point, but has not been used for that
 purpose but for writing on, and at about the same date. The passages
 are given as Nos. 1217, 1218, 1219, 1162 and No. 994 (see note page
 218). The text given above is obviously not a fragment of a letter,
 but a record of some personal experience. No. 1379 also seems to
 refer to Leonardo's journeys in Southern Italy.</p>

 Mongibello is a name commonly given in Sicily to Mount Etna (from
 Djebel, Arab.=mountain). Fr. FERRARA, <i>Descrizione dell' Etna con la
 storia delle eruzioni</i> (Palermo, 1818, p. 88) tells us, on the
 authority of the <i>Cronaca del Monastero Benedettino di Licordia</i> of
 an eruption of the Volcano with a great flow of lava on Sept. 21,
 1447. The next records of the mountain are from the years 1533 and
 1536. A. Percy neither does mention any eruptions of Etna during the
 years to which this note must probably refer <i>Memoire des
 tremblements de terre de la peninsule italique, Vol. XXII des
 Memoires couronnees et Memoires des savants etrangers. Academie
 Royal de Belgique</i>).
 </p><p>
 A literal interpretation of the passage would not, however, indicate
 an allusion to any great eruption; particularly in the connection
 with Stromboli, where the periodical outbreaks in very short
 intervals are very striking to any observer, especially at night
 time, when passing the island on the way from Naples to Messina.</p>
