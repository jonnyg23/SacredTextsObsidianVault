 Begin with the address of Niccolo Piccinino to the soldiers and the
 banished Florentines among whom are Messer Rinaldo degli Albizzi and
 other Florentines. Then let it be shown how he first mounted on
 horseback in armour; and the whole army came after him--40 squadrons
 of cavalry, and 2000 foot soldiers went with him. Very early in the
 morning the Patriarch went up a hill to reconnoitre the country,
 that is the hills, fields and the valley watered by a river; and
 from thence he beheld Niccolo Picinino coming from Borgo San
 Sepolcro with his people, and with a great dust; and perceiving them
 he returned to the camp of his own people and addressed them. Having
 spoken he prayed to God with clasped hands, when there appeared a
 cloud in which Saint Peter appeared and spoke to the Patriarch.--500
 cavalry were sent forward by the Patriarch to hinder or check the
 rush of the enemy. In the foremost troop Francesco the son of
 Niccolo Piccinino [24] was the first to attack the bridge which was
 held by the Patriarch and the Florentines. Beyond the bridge to his
 left he sent forward some infantry to engage ours, who drove them
 back, among

 <p>whom was their captain Micheletto [29] whose lot it was
 to be that day at the head of the army. Here, at this bridge there
 is a severe struggle; our men conquer and the enemy is repulsed.
 Here Guido and Astorre, his brother, the Lord of Faenza with a great
 number of men, re-formed and renewed the fight, and rushed upon the
 Florentines with such force that they recovered the bridge and
 pushed forward as far as the tents. But Simonetto advanced with 600
 horse, and fell upon the enemy and drove them back once more from
 the place, and recaptured the bridge; and behind him came more men
 with 2000 horse soldiers. And thus for a long time they fought with
 varying fortune. But then the Patriarch, in order to divert the
 enemy, sent forward Niccolo da Pisa [44] and Napoleone Orsino, a
 beardless lad, followed by a great multitude of men, and then was
 done another great feat of arms. At the same time Niccolo Piccinino
 urged forward the remnant of his men, who once more made ours give
 way; and if it had not been that the Patriarch set himself at their
 head and, by his words and deeds controlled the captains, our
 soldiers would have taken to flight. The Patriarch had some
 artillery placed on the hill and with these he dispersed the enemy's
 infantry; and the disorder was so complete that Niccolo began to
 call back his son and all his men, and they took to flight towards
 Borgo. And then began a great slaughter of men; none escaped but the
 foremost of those who had fled or who hid themselves. The battle
 continued until sunset, when the Patriarch gave his mind to
 recalling his men and burying the dead, and afterwards a trophy was
 erected.

 <p><a name="fn_308"></a><a href="0669.htm#fr_308">349:306</a> : 669. This passage does not seem to me to be in Leonardo's
 hand, though it has hitherto been generally accepted as genuine. Not
 only is the writing unlike his, but the spelling also is quite
 different. I would suggest that this passage is a description of the
 events of the battle drawn up for the Painter by order of the
 Signoria, perhaps by some historian commissioned by them, to serve
 as a scheme or programme of the work. The whole tenor of the style
 seems to me to argue in favour of this theory; and besides, it would
 be in no way surprising that such a document should have been
 preserved among Leonardo's autographs.</p>
