 The ancient architects ...... beginning with the Egyptians (?) who,
 as Diodorus Siculus writes, were the first to build and construct
 large cities and castles, public and private buildings of fine form,
 large and well proportioned .....

 The column, which has its thickness at the third part .... The one
 which would be thinnest in the middle, would break ...; the one
 which is of equal thickness and of equal strength, is better for the
 edifice. The second best as to the usefulness will be the one whose
 greatest thickness is where it joins with the base.

 The capital must be formed in this way. Divide its thickness at the
 top into 8; at the foot make it 5/7, and let it be 5/7 high and you
 will have a square; afterwards divide the height into 8 parts as you
 did for the column, and then take 1/8 for the echinus and another
 eighth for the thickness of the abacus on the top of the capital.
 The horns of the abacus of the capital have to project beyond the
 greatest width of the bell 2/7, i. e. sevenths of the top of the
 bell, so 1/7 falls to the projection of each horn. The truncated
 part of the horns must be as broad as it is high. I leave the rest,
 that is the ornaments, to the taste of the sculptors. But to return
 to the columns and in order to prove the reason of their strength or
 weakness according to their shape, I say that when the lines
 starting from the summit of the column and ending at its base and
 their direction and length ..., their distance apart or width may be
 equal; I say that this column ...
