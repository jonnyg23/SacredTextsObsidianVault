 <p>
 Just as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each
 other--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the
 images of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the
 object opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the
 converging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge
 again beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that
 image. But their impressions will

 <p>appear reversed--as is shown in
 the first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it
 enters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.
 </p><p>
 Read the marginal text on the other side.
 </p><p>
 In proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so
 much less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect
 each other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a
 dark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in
 proportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let <i>a b</i> be an
 object in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image
 of its darkened form through the opening <i>d e</i> which is as wide as
 this shaded body; and its sides <i>a b</i>, being straight lines (as has
 been proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the
 opening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller
 than the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your
 left hand, in the two diagrams <i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> <i>n</i> <i>m</i> <i>o</i> where, the
 right opening <i>d</i> <i>e</i>, being equal in width to the shaded object <i>a</i>
 <i>b</i>, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs
 half way between the opening and the shaded object at the point <i>c</i>.
 But this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening <i>o</i>
 being much smaller than the shaded object <i>n</i> <i>m</i>.
 </p><p>
 It is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between
 the objects and the
 </p><p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>
 <p>openings through which the images of these
 bodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere
 is illuminated these images are not formed visibly.
 </p><p>
 When the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they
 are invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let <i>d</i> <i>e</i> <i>h</i>
 be such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space
 between the bodies in <i>b</i> and <i>i</i> this will not hinder its being
 seen from <i>f</i> <i>g</i> or from <i>f</i> <i>m</i>; being composed of the images <i>a</i>
 <i>b</i> <i>i</i> <i>k</i> which run together in <i>d</i> <i>e</i> <i>h</i>.
