 A man saw a large sword which another one wore at his side. Said he
 "Poor fellow, for a long time I have seen you tied to that weapon;
 why do you not release yourself as your hands are untied, and set
 yourself free?" To which the other replied: "This is none of yours,
 on the contrary it is an old story." The former speaker, feeling
 stung, replied: "I know that you are acquainted with so few things
 in this world, that I thought anything I could tell you would be new
 to you."
