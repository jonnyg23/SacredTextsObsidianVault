 This beast is born in Scandinavia. It has the shape of a great
 horse, excepting that the great length of its neck and of its ears
 make a difference. It feeds on grass, going backwards, for it has so
 long an upper lip that if it went forwards it would cover up the
 grass. Its legs are all in one piece; for this reason when it wants
 to sleep it leans against a tree, and the hunters, spying out the
 place where it is wont to sleep, saw the tree almost through, and
 then, when it leans against it to sleep, in its sleep it falls, and
 thus the hunters take it. And every other mode of taking it is in
 vain, because it is incredibly swift in running.
