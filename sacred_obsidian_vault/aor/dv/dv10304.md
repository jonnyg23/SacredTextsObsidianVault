 <h3 align="CENTER"><i>Theory of colours.</i></h3>
 <p>
 <i>Leonardo's theory of colours is even more intimately connected with
 his principles of light and shade than his Perspective of
 Disappearance and is in fact merely an appendix or supplement to
 those principles, as we gather from the titles to sections</i> 264,
 267<i>, and </i>276<i>, while others again</i> (<i>Nos.</i> 281, 282<i>) are headed</i>
 Prospettiva.

 <i>A very few of these chapters are to be found in the oldest copies
 and editions of the Treatise on Painting, and although the material
 they afford is but meager and the connection between them but
 slight, we must still attribute to them a special theoretical value
 as well as practical utility--all the more so because our knowledge
 of the theory and use of colours at the time of the Renaissance is
 still extremely limited.</i>
