 <p>
 How figures dressed in a cloak should not show the shape so much as
 that the cloak looks as if it were next the flesh; since you surely
 cannot wish the cloak to be next the flesh, for you must suppose
 that between the flesh and the cloak there are other garments which
 prevent the forms of the limbs appearing distinctly through the
 cloak. And those limbs which you allow to be seen you must make
 thicker so that the other garments may appear to be under the cloak.
 But only give something of the true thickness of the limbs to a
 nymph  <a name="fr_200"></a><a href="#fn_200"><font size="1">198</font></a>
  or an
 angel, which are represented in thin draperies, pressed and clinging
 to the limbs of the figures by the action of the wind.
