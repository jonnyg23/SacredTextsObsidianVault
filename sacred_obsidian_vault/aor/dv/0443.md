 <p>
 Landscapes should be represented so that the trees may be half in
 light and half in shadow; but it is better to do them when the sun
 is covered with clouds, for then the trees are lighted by the
 general light of the sky, and the general darkness of the earth. And
 then they are darkest in certain parts in proportion as those parts
 are nearest to the middle of the tree and to the earth.
