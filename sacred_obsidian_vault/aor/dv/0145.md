 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE DIFFERENT LIGHT AND SHADE IN VARIOUS ASPECTS AND OF OBJECTS PLACED IN THEM.</h3>
 <p>
 If the sun is in the East and you look towards the West you will see
 every thing in full light and totally without shadow because you see
 them from the same side as the sun: and if you look towards the
 South or North you will see all objects in light and shade, because
 you see both the side towards the sun and the side away from it; and
 if you look towards the coming of the sun all objects will show you
 their shaded side, because on that side the sun cannot fall upon
 them.
