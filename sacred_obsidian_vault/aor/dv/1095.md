 The Tigris passes through Asia Minor and brings with it the water of
 three lakes, one after the other of various elevations; the first
 being Munace and the middle Pallas and the lowest Triton. And the
 Nile again springs from three very high lakes in Ethiopia, and runs
 northwards towards the sea of Egypt with a course of 4000 miles, and
 by the shortest and straightest line it is 3000 miles. It is said
 that it issues from the Mountains of the Moon, and has various
 unknown sources. The said lakes are about 4000 braccia above the
 surface of the sphere of water, that is 1 mile and 1/3, giving to
 the Nile a fall of 1 braccia in every mile.
