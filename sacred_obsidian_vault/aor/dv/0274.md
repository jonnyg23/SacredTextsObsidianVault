 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE IMAGES IN THE PUPIL OF THE EYE.</h3>
 <p>
 The intersections of the images as they enter the pupil do not
 mingle in confusion in the space where that intersection unites
 them; as is evident, since, if the rays of the sun pass through two
 panes of glass in close contact, of which one is blue and the other
 yellow, the rays, in penetrating them, do not become blue or yellow
 but a beautiful green. And the same thing would happen in the eye,
 if the images which were yellow or green should mingle where they
 [meet and] intersect as they enter the pupil. As this does not
 happen such a mingling does not exist.

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE NATURE OF THE RAYS COMPOSED OF THE IMAGES OF OBJECTS, AND OF THEIR INTERSECTIONS.</h3>
 <p>
 The directness of the rays which transmit the forms and colours of
 the bodies whence they proceed does not tinge the air nor can they
 affect each other by contact where they intersect. They affect only
 the spot where they vanish and cease to exist, because that spot
 faces and is faced by the original source of these rays, and no
 other object, which surrounds that original source can be seen by
 the eye where these rays are cut off and destroyed, leaving there
 the spoil they have conveyed to it. And this is proved by the 4th
 [proposition], on the colour of bodies, which says: The surface of
 every opaque body is affected by the colour of surrounding objects;
 hence we may conclude that the spot which, by means of the rays
 which convey the image, faces--and is faced by the cause of the
 image, assumes the colour of that object.
