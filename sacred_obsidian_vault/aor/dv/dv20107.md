 <i>Leonardo's eminent place in the history of medicine, as a pioneer
 in the sciences of Anatomy and Physiology, will never be appreciated
 till it is possible to publish the mass of manuscripts in which he
 largely treated of these two branches of learning. In the present
 work I must necessarily limit myself to giving the reader a general
 view of these labours, by publishing his introductory notes to the
 various books on anatomical subjects. I have added some extracts,
 and such observations as are scattered incidentally through these
 treatises, as serving to throw a light on Leonardo's scientific
 attitude, besides having an interest for a wider circle than that of
 specialists only.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>VASARI expressly mentions Leonardo's anatomical studies, having had
 occasion to examine the manuscript books which refer to them.
 According to him Leonardo studied Anatomy in the companionship of
 Marc Antonio della Torre</i> "aiutato e scambievolmente
 aiutando."<i>--This learned Anatomist taught the science in the
 universities first of Padua and then of Pavia, and at Pavia he and
 Leonardo may have worked and studied together. We have no clue to
 any exact dates, but in the year 1506 Marc Antonio della Torre seems
 to have not yet left Padua. He was scarcely thirty years old when he
 died in 1512, and his writings on anatomy have not only never been
 published, but no manuscript copy of them is known to exist.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>This is not the place to enlarge on the connection between Leonardo
 and Marc Antonio della Torre. I may however observe that I have not
 been able to discover in Leonardo's manuscripts on anatomy any
 mention of his younger contemporary. The few quotations which occur
 from writers on medicine--either of antiquity or of the middle ages
 are printed in Section XXII. Here and there in the manuscripts
 mention is made of an anonymous "adversary"</i> (avversario) <i>whose
 views are opposed and refuted by Leonardo, but there is no ground
 for supposing that Marc Antonio della Torre should have been this
 "adversary".</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Only a very small selection from the mass of anatomical drawings
 left by Leonardo have been published here in facsimile, but to form
 any adequate idea of their scientific</i>

 <p><i>merit they should be compared
 with the coarse and inadequate figures given in the published books
 of the early part of the XVI. century.
 </i></p><p>
 William Hunter, the great surgeon--a competent judge--who had an
 opportunity in the time of George III. of seeing the originals in
 the King's Library, has thus recorded his opinion: "I expected to
 see little more than such designs in Anatomy as might be useful to a
 painter in his own profession. But I saw, and indeed with
 astonishment, that Leonardo had been a general and deep student.
 When I consider what pains he has taken upon every part of the body,
 the superiority of his universal genius, his particular excellence
 in mechanics and hydraulics, and the attention with which such a man
 would examine and see objects which he has to draw, I am fully
 persuaded that Leonardo was the best Anatomist, at that time, in the
 world ... Leonardo was certainly the first man, we know of, who
 introduced the practice of making anatomical drawings" (Two
 introductory letters. London 1784, pages 37 and 39).
 </p><p>
 The illustrious German Naturalist Johan Friedrich Blumenback
 esteemed them no less highly; he was one of the privileged few who,
 after Hunter, had the chance of seeing these Manuscripts. He writes:
 Der Scharfblick dieses grossen Forschers und Darstellers der Natur
 hat schon auf Dinge geachtet, die noch Jahrhunderte nachher
 unbemerkt geblieben sind<i>" (see </i>Blumenbach's medicinische
 Bibliothek<i>, Vol. 3, St. 4, 1795. page 728).
 </i></p><p>
 These opinions were founded on the drawings alone. Up to the present
 day hardly anything has been made known of the text, and, for the
 reasons I have given, it is my intention to reproduce here no more
 than a selection of extracts which I have made from the originals at
 Windsor Castle and elsewhere. In the Bibliography of the
 Manuscripts, at the end of this volume a short review is given of
 the valuable contents of these Anatomical note books which are at
 present almost all in the possession of her Majesty the Queen of
 England. It is, I believe, possible to assign the date with
 approximate accuracy to almost all the fragments, and I am thus led
 to conclude that the greater part of Leonardo's anatomical
 investigations were carried out after the death of della Torre.
 </p><p>
 Merely in reading the introductory notes to his various books on
 Anatomy which are here printed it is impossible to resist the
 impression that the Master's anatomical studies bear to a very great
 extent the stamp of originality and independent thought.
