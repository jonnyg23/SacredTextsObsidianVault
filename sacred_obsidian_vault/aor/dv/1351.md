 </p><p>
 I was so greatly rejoiced, most illustrious Lord, by the desired
 restoration of your health, that it almost had the effect that [my
 own health recovered]--[I have got through my illness]--my own
 illness left me-- --of your Excellency's almost restored health. But
 I am extremely vexed that I have not been able completely to satisfy
 the wishes of your Excellency, by reason of the wickedness of that
 deceiver, for whom I left nothing undone which could be done for him
 by me and by which I might be of use to him; and in the first place
 his allowances were paid to him before the time, which I believe he
 would willingly deny, if I had not the writing signed by myself and
 the interpreter. And I, seeing that he did not work for me unless he
 had no work to do for others, which he was very careful in
 solliciting, invited him to dine with me, and to work afterwards
 near me, because, besides the saving of expense, he

 <p>would acquire the Italian language. He always promised, but would
 never do so. And this I did also, because that Giovanni, the German
 who makes the mirrors, was there always in the workshop, and wanted
 to see and to know all that was being done there and made it known
 outside ... strongly criticising it; and because he dined with those
 of the Pope's guard, and then they went out with guns killing birds
 among the ruins; and this went on from after dinner till the
 evening; and when I sent Lorenzo to urge him to work he said that he
 would not have so many masters over him, and that his work was for
 your Excellency's Wardrobe; and thus two months passed and so it
 went on; and one day finding Gian Niccolo of the Wardrobe and asking
 whether the German had finished the work for your Magnificence, he
 told me this was not true, but only that he had given him two guns
 to clean. Afterwards, when I had urged him farther, be left the
 workshop and began to work in his room, and lost much time in making
 another pair of pincers and files and other tools with screws; and
 there he worked at mills for twisting silk which he hid when any one
 of my people went in, and with a thousand oaths and mutterings, so
 that none of them would go there any more.
 </p><p>
 I was so greatly rejoiced, most Illustrious Lord, by the desired
 restoration of your health, that my own illness almost left me. But
 I am greatly vexed at not having been able to completely satisfy
 your Excellency's wishes by reason of the wickedness of that German
 deceiver, for whom I left nothing undone by which I could have hope
 to please him; and secondly I invited him to lodge and board with
 me, by which means I should constantly see the work he was doing and
 with greater ease correct his errors while, besides this, he would
 learn the Italian tongue, by means of which be could with more ease
 talk without an interpreter; his moneys were always given him in
 advance of the
 </p><p><a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 409</font></a></p>
 <p>time when due. Afterwards he wanted to have the
 models finished in wood, just as they were to be in iron, and wished
 to carry them away to his own country. But this I refused him,
 telling him that I would give him, in drawing, the breadth, length,
 height and form of what he had to do; and so we remained in
 ill-will.
 </p><p>
 The next thing was that he made himself another workshop and pincers
 and tools in his room where he slept, and there he worked for
 others; afterwards he went to dine with the Swiss of the guard,
 where there are idle fellows, in which he beat them all; and most
 times they went two or three together with guns, to shoot birds
 among the ruins, and this went on till evening.
 </p><p>
 At last I found how this master Giovanni the mirror-maker was he who
 had done it all, for two reasons; the first because he had said that
 my coming here had deprived him of the countenance and favour of
 your Lordship which always... The other is that he said that his
 iron-workers' rooms suited him for working at his mirrors, and of
 this he gave proof; for besides making him my enemy, he made him
 sell all he had and leave his workshop to him, where he works with a
 number of workmen making numerous mirrors to send to the fairs.

 <p><a name="fn_380"></a><a href="1351.htm#fr_380">407:686</a> : 1351. 1353.It is clear from the contents of this notes
 that they refer to Leonardo's residence in Rome in 1513-1515. Nor
 can there be any doubt that they were addressed to Leonardo's patron
 at the time: Giuliano de' Medici, third son of Lorenzo the
 Magnificent and brother of Pope Leo X (born 1478). In 1512 he became
 the head of the Florentine Republic. The Pope invited him to Rome,
 where he settled; in 1513 he was named patrician with much splendid
 ceremonial. The medal struck in honour of the event bears the words
 MAG. IVLIAN. MEDICES. Leonardo too uses the style "Magnifico", in
 his letter. Compare also No. 1377.
 </p><p>
 GlNO CAPPONI (<i>Storia della Repubblica di Firenze</i>, Vol. III, p.
 139) thus describes the character of Giuliano de' Medici, who died
 in 1516: <i>Era il migliore della famiglia, di vita placida, grande
 spenditore, tenendo intorno a sè uomini ingegnosi, ed ogni nuova
 cosa voleva provare.</i>
 </p><p>
 See too GREGOROVIUS, <i>Geschichte der Stadi Rom</i>, VIII (book XIV.
 III, 2): <i>Die Luftschlösser fürstlicher Grösse, wozu ihn der
 Papst hatte erheben wollen zerfielen. Julian war der edelste aller
 damaligen Medici, ein Mensch von innerlicher Richtung, unbefriedigt
 durch das Leben, mitten im Sonnenglanz der Herrlichkeit Leo's X.
 eine dunkle Gestalt die wie ein Schatten vorüberzog.</i> Giuliano
 lived in the Vatican, and it may be safely inferred from No. 1352 l.
 2, and No. 1353 l. 4, that Leonardo did the same.
 </p><p>
 From the following unpublished notice in the Vatican archives, which
 M. Eug. Müntz, librarian of the Ecole des Beaux arts, Paris, has
 done me the favour to communicate to me, we get a more accurate view
 of Leonardo's relation to the often named GIORGIO TEDESCO:
 </p><p>
 <i>Nota delle provisione</i> (sic) <i>a da pagare per me in nome del nostro
 ill. S. Bernardo Bini e chomp<sup>a</sup> di Roma, e prima della ill<sup>ma</sup> sua
 chonsorte ogni mese d. 800.
 </i></p><p>
 A L<sup>do</sup> da Vinci per sua provisione d. XXXIII, e più d. VII al detto
 per la provisione di Giorgio tedescho, che sono in tutto d. 40.
 </p><p>
 From this we learn, that seven ducats formed the German's monthly
 wages, but according to No. 1353 l. 7 he pretended that eight ducats
 had been agreed upon.</p>
