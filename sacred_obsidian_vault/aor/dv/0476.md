 When clouds come between the sun and the eye all the upper edges of
 their round forms are light, and towards the middle they
 </p><p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a></p>
 <p>are dark,
 and this happens because towards the top these edges have the sun
 above them while you are below them; and the same thing happens with
 the position of the branches of trees; and again the clouds, like
 the trees, being somewhat transparent, are lighted up in part, and
 at the edges they show thinner.
 </p><p>
 But, when the eye is between the cloud and the sun, the cloud has
 the contrary effect to the former, for the edges of its mass are
 dark and it is light towards the middle; and this happens because
 you see the same side as faces the sun, and because the edges have
 some transparency and reveal to the eye that portion which is hidden
 beyond them, and which, as it does not catch the sunlight like that
 portion turned towards it, is necessarily somewhat darker. Again, it
 may be that you see the details of these rounded masses from the
 lower side, while the sun shines on the upper side and as they are
 not so situated as to reflect the light of the sun, as in the first
 instance they remain dark.
 </p><p>
 The black clouds which are often seen higher up than those which are
 illuminated by the sun are shaded by other clouds, lying between
 them and the sun.
 </p><p>
 Again, the rounded forms of the clouds that face the sun, show their
 edges dark because they lie against the light background; and to see
 that this is true, you may look at the top of any cloud that is
 wholly light because it lies against the blue of the atmosphere,
 which is darker than the cloud.
