 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The use of the book on Painting.</font></span>These rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every
 man makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows
 them not, cannot amend them. But you, knowing your errors, will
 correct your works and where you find mistakes amend them, and
 remember never to fall into them again. But if you try to apply
 these rules in composition you will never make an end, and will
 produce confusion in your works.
 </p><p>
 These rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since
 good judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear
 understanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound
 rules are the issue of sound experience--the common mother of all
 the sciences and arts. Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my
 rules, you will be able, merely by your amended judgment, to
 criticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a
 work, whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing
 else.
