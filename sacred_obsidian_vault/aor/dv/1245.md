 <p>
 The huge elephant has by nature what is rarely found in man; that is
 Honesty, Prudence, Justice, and the Observance of Religion; inasmuch
 as when the moon is new, these beasts go down to the rivers, and
 there, solemnly cleansing themselves, they bathe, and so, having
 saluted the planet, return to the woods. And when they are ill,
 being laid down, they fling up plants towards Heaven as though they
 would offer sacrifice. --They bury their tusks when they fall out
 from old age.--Of these two tusks they use one to dig up roots for
 food; but they save the point of the other for fighting with; when
 they are taken by hunters and when worn out by fatigue, they dig up
 these buried tusks and ransom themselves.
