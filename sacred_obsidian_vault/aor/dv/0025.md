 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> Focus of sight.</font></span>If the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it,
 it cannot judge of it well--as happens to a man who tries to see the
 tip of his nose. Hence, as a general rule, Nature teaches us that an
 object can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and
 the eye is equal, at least, to the length of the face.
