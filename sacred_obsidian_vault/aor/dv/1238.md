 <p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE GRASSHOPPER.</h3>
 <p>
 This silences the cuckoo with its song. It dies in oil and revives
 in vinegar. It sings in the greatest heats
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE BAT.</h3>
 <p>
 The more light there is the blinder this creature becomes; as those
 who gaze most at the sun become most dazzled.--For Vice, that cannot
 remain where Virtue appears.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE PARTRIDGE.</h3>
 <p>
 This bird changes from the female into the male and forgets its
 former sex; and out of envy it steals the eggs from others and
 hatches them, but the young ones follow the true mother.
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE SWALLOW.</h3>
 <p>
 This bird gives sight to its blind young ones by means of celandine.
