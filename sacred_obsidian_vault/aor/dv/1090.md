 <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"> The Levantine Sea.</font></span>On the shores of the Mediterranean 300 rivers flow, and 40, 200
 ports. And this sea is 3000 miles long. Many times has the increase
 of its waters, heaped up by their backward flow and the blowing of
 the West winds, caused the overflow of the Nile and of the rivers
 which flow out through the Black Sea, and have so much raised the
 seas that they have spread with vast floods over many countries. And
 these floods take place at the time when the sun melts the snows on
 the high mountains of Ethiopia that rise up into the cold regions of
 the air; and in the same way the approach of the sun acts on the
 mountains of Sarmatia in Asia and on those in Europe; so that the
 gathering together of these three things are, and always have been,
 the cause of tremendous floods: that is, the return flow of the sea
 with the West wind and the melting of the snows. So every river will
 overflow in Syria, in Samaria, in Judea between Sinai and the
 Lebanon, and in the rest of Syria between the Lebanon and the Taurus
 mountains, and in Cilicia, in the Armenian mountains, and in
 Pamphilia and in Lycia within the hills,

 <p>and in Egypt as far as the
 Atlas mountains. The gulf of Persia which was formerly a vast lake
 of the Tigris and discharged into the Indian Sea, has now worn away
 the mountains which formed its banks and laid them even with the
 level of the Indian ocean. And if the Mediterranean had continued
 its flow through the gulf of Arabia, it would have done the same,
 that is to say, would have reduced the level of the Mediterranean to
 that of the Indian Sea.
