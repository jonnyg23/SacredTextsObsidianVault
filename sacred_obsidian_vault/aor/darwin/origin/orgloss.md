 <h3>Glossary</h3>
 <h4>Glossary of the Principal Scientific Terms Used In the Present Volume</h4>
 
 <p>I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. W. S. Dallas for this Glossary,
 which has been given because several readers have complained to me
 that some of the terms used were unintelligible to them. Mr. Dallas
 has endeavoured to give the explanations of the terms in as popular
 a form as possible.
 
 </p><dl>
 <dt>ABERRANT</dt>
 <dd>
 Forms or groups of animals or plants which deviate in
 important characters from their nearest allies, so as not to be easily
 included in the same group with them, are said to be aberrant.
 </dd>
 <dt>ABERRATION (in Optics)</dt>
 <dd>In the refraction of light by a convex
 lens the rays passing through different parts of the lens are
 brought to a focus at slightly different distances,- this is called
 spherical aberration; at the same time the coloured rays are separated
 by the prismatic action of the lens and likewise brought to a focus at
 different distances, this is chromatic aberration.
 </dd>
 <dt>ABNORMAL</dt>
 <dd>Contrary to the general rule.</dd>
 <dt>ABORTED</dt>
 <dd>

 been arrested at a very early stage.
 </dd>
   <dt>ALBINISM</dt>
 <dd>Albinos are animals in which the usual colouring matters
 characteristic of the species have not been produced in the skin and
 its appendages. Albinism is the state of being an albino.

 budding, or by the division of the substance of the first product of
 the egg.

 whelks, oysters, mussels, and cockles, may serve as examples of them.
   </dd><dt>MONOCOTYLEDONS, or MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS</dt>
 <dd>Plants in which the seed
 sends up only a single seed-leaf (or cotyledon); characterised by

 and by a process of budding with or without separation from the parent
 of the product of the latter, which is often very different from
 that of the egg. The individuality of the species is represented by
 the whole of the form produced between two sexual reproductions; and
 these forms, which are apparently individual animals, have been called
 zooide.
