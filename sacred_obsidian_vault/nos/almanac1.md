 </p><p>
 Near Geneva terror will be great,<br>
 Through the counsel, that cannot fail:<br>
 The new King has his league prepare,<br>

 </p><p>
 O cruel Mars, how you should be feared,<br>
 More is the scythe with the silver conjoined:<br>
 Fleet, forces, water, wind of shadow to fear,<br>
 Sea and land in a truce.  The friends has joined L.V.<br>
 </p><p>
 For not having a guard you will be more offended,<br>
 The weak fort, Pinquiet uneasy and pacific:<br>
 They cry "famine," the people are oppressed,<br>
 The sea reddens, the Long one proud and iniquitous.<br>
 </p><p>
 The five, six, fifteen, late and soon they remain,<br>
 The heir’s bloodline ended: the cities revolted:<br>
 The herald of peace twenty and three return,<br>
 The open-hearted five locked up, news invented.<br>
 </p><p>
 At a distance, near the Aquarius, Saturn turns back,<br>
 That year great Mars will give a fire opposition,<br>
 Towards the North to the south the great proud female,<br>
 Florida in contemplation will hold the port.<br>
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 Six, twelve, thirteen, twenty will speak to the Lady,<br>
 The older one by a woman will be corrupted:<br>
 Dijon, Guienne hail, lightning makes the first cut into it,<br>
 The insatiable one of blood and wine satisfied.<br>
 </p><p>
 The sky to weep for him, made to do that!<br>
 The sea is being prepared, Hannibal to plan his ruse:<br>
 Denis [drops anchor], fleet delays, does not remain silent,<br>
 Has not known the secret, and by which you are amused!<br>
 </p><p>
 Venus Neptune will pursue the enterprise,<br>
 Pensive one imprisoned, adversaries troubled:<br>
 Fleet in the Adriatic, cities towards the Thames,<br>
 The fourth clamor, by night, the reposing ones wounded.<br>
 </p><p>
 The great one of the sky the cape will give,<br>
 Relief, Adriatic makes an offer to the port:<br>
 He who will be able will save himself from dangers,<br>
 By night the Great One wounded pursues.<br>
 </p><p>
 The port protests too fraudulently and false,<br>
 The maw opened, condition of peace:<br>
 Rhone in crystal, water, snow, ice stained,<br>
 The death, death, wind, through rain the burden broken.<br>
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 				Almanac of 1558<br>
 </p><p>
 The young King makes a funeral wedding soon,<br>
 Holy one stirred up, feasts, of the said, Mars dormant:<br>

 The arrest and peace broken on all sides.<br>
 </p><p>
 Vain rumor within the Hierarchy,<br>
 Genoa to rebel: courses, offenses, tumults:<br>
 For the greater King will be the monarchy,<br>
 Election, conflict, covert burials.<br>
 </p><p>
 Through discord in the absence to fail,<br>
 One suddenly will put him back on top:<br>
 Towards the North will be noises so loud,<br>
 Lesions, points to travel, above.<br>
 </p><p>
 On the Tyrrhenian Sea, of different sail,<br>
 On the Ocean there will be diverse assaults:<br>
 Plague, poison, blood in the house of canvas,<br>
 Prefects, Legates stirred up to march high seas.<br>
 </p><p>
 There where the faith was it will be broken,<br>
 The enemies will feed upon the enemies:<br>
 Fire rains [from the] Sky, it will burn, interrupted,<br>
 Enterprise by night.  Chief will make quarrels.<br>
 </p><p>
 War, thunder, forces fields, depopulated,<br>
 Terror and noise, assault on the frontier:<br>
 Great Great One fallen, pardon for the exiles,<br>
 Germans, Spaniards, by the sea the Barbarian banner.<br>
 </p><p>
 The noise will be vain, the faltering ones bundled up,<br>
 The Shaven Ones captured: the all-powerful One elected:<br>
 The two Reds and four true crusaders to fail,<br>
 Rain troublesome to the powerful Monarch.<br>
 </p><p>
 Rain, wind, forces, Barbarossa Hister, the Tyrrhenian Sea,<br>
 Vessels to pass Orkneys and beyond Gibraltar, grain and soldiers provided:<br>
 Retreats too well executed by Florence, Siena crossed,<br>
 The two will be dead, friendships joined.<br>
 </p><p>
 Venus the beautiful will enter Florence.<br>

 Games, feasts, nuptials, dead Prelate of renown.<br>
 Noise, peace of truce while the enemy threatens:<br>
 Sea, land and sky noise, deed of the great Brennus,<br>
 Cries gold, silver, the enemy they ruin.<br>
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 				Almanac of 1560<br>
 </p><p>

 The year peace is being prepared, plague, schismatic famine:<br>
 Put outside inside, sky to change, domicile,<br>
 End of holiday, hierarchical revolt.<br>
 </p><p>
 Diet to break up, the ancient sacred one to recover,<br>
 Under the two, fire through pardon to result:<br>
 Consecration without arms: the tall Red will want to have,<br>
 Peace of neglect, the Elected One, the Widower, to live.<br>
 </p><p>
 To be made to appear elected with novelty,<br>
 Place of day-labor to go beyond the boundaries:<br>
 The feigned goodness to change to cruelty,<br>
 From the suspected place quickly will they all go out.<br>
 </p><p>
 With the place chosen, the Shaved Ones will not be contented,<br>

 They will be driven out and then restored on top:<br>
 The Great Great woman will be found content,<br>
 Blind ones, deaf ones will be put uppermost.<br>
 </p><p>
 He will not be placed, the New Ones expelled,<br>
 Black king and the Great One will hold hard:<br>
 To have recourse to arms.  Exiles expelled further,<br>
 To sing of victory, not free, consolation.<br>
 </p><p>
 The mourning left behind, supreme alliances,<br>
 Great Shaven One dead, refusal given at the entrance:<br>
 Upon return kindness to be in oblivion,<br>
 The death of the just one perpetrated at a banquet.<br>
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 				Almanac of 1562<br>
 </p><p>
 Season of winter, good spring, sound, bad summer,<br>
 Pernicious autumn, dry, wheat rare:<br>
 Of wine enough, bad eyes, deeds, molested,<br>
 War, mutiny, seditious waste.<br>
 </p><p>
 The hidden desire for the good will succeed,<br>
 Religion, peace, love and concord:<br>
 The nuptial song will not be completely in accord,<br>
 The high ones, who are low, and high, put to the rope.<br>
 </p><p>
 For the Shaven Ones the Chief will not reach the end,<br>
 Edicts changed, the secret ones set at large:<br>
 Great One found dead, less of faith, low standing,<br>
 Dissimulated, shuddering, wounded in the boar’s lair.<br>
 </p><p>
 Moved by Lion, near Lion he will undermine,<br>
 Taken, captive, pacified by a woman:<br>
 He will not hold as well as they will waver,<br>
 Placed unpassed, to oust the soul from rage.<br>
 </p><p>
 From Lion he will come to arouse to move,<br>
 Vain discovery against infinite people:<br>
 Known by none the evil for the duty,<br>
 In the kitchen found dead and finished.<br>
 </p><p>
 Nothing in accord, worse and more severe trouble,<br>
 As it was, land and sea to quieten:<br>
 All arrested, it will not be worth a double,<br>
 The iniquitous one will speak, Counsel of annihilation.<br>
 </p><p>
 Portentous deed, horrible and incredible,<br>
 Typhoon will make the wicked ones move:<br>
 Those who then afterwards supported by the cable,<br>
 And the greater part exiled on the fields.<br>
 </p><p>
 Right put on the throne come into France from the sky,<br>
 The whole world pacified by Virtue:<br>
 Much blood to scatter, sooner change to come,<br>
 By the birds, and by fire, and not by vers.<br>
 </p><p>
 The colored ones, the Sacred malcontents,<br>
 Then suddenly through the happy Androgynes:<br>
 Of the great part to see, the time not come,<br>
 Several amongst them will make their soups weak.<br>
 </p><p>
 They will be returned to their full power,<br>
 Conjoined at one point of the accord, not in accord:<br>
 All defied, more promised to the Shaven Ones,<br>
 Several amongst them outflanked in a band.<br>
 </p><p>
 For the legate of terrestrial and dawn,<br>
 The great Cape will accommodate himself to all:<br>
 Tacit LORRAINE, to be listening,<br>
 He whose advice they will not want to agree with.<br>
 </p><p>
 The enemy wind will impede the troop,<br>
 For the greatest one advance put in difficulty:<br>
 Wine with poison will be put in the cup,<br>
 To pass the great gun without horse-power.<br>
 </p><p>
 Through crystal the enterprise is broken,<br>
 Games and feats, in LYONS to repose more:<br>
 No longer will he take his repast with the Great Ones,<br>
 Sudden catarrh, blessed water, to bathe him.<br>
