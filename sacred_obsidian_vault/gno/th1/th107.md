 <h4 align="center">THE POPULAR THEURGIC HERMES-CULT IN THE GREEK MAGIC PAPYRI </h4>
 
 <h5 align="center">THE “RELIGION OF HERMES” </h5>
 
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">That</span> at one period the “Religion of Hermes” was not only widely spread, but practically supreme, in popular Hellenistic circles, may be seen from a study of the texts of the numerous magic papyri which have been preserved, and made accessible to us by the industry of such immensely laborious scholars as Leemans, Dieterich, Wessely, and Kenyon. </p>
 
 <p>The Greek Hermes prayers, as with many others of a similar nature, are manifestly overworkings of more ancient types, and, as we might expect, are of a strongly syncretistic nature. In them we can distinguish in popular forms, based on the ancient traditions of Egyptian magic, most interesting shadows of the philosophic and theosophic ideas which our Trismegistic literature has set forth for us in the clear light of dignified simplicity. </p>
 
 <p>But just as we now know that the once so-called “Gnostic,” Abraxas and Abraxoid amulets, gems, and rings pertained to the general popular magical religion and had nothing to do with the Gnosis proper, so we may be sure that the circles of high mysticism, who refused to offer to God even so pure a sacrifice as </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a></p>
 
 <p>the burnt offering of incense, and deemed naught worthy of Him, short of the “prayers and praises of the mind,” had nothing directly to do with the popular Hermes prayers, least of all with the invocatory rites of popular theurgy, and phylactery or amulet consecration. </p>
 
 <p>Nevertheless, there is much of interest for us in these invocations, and much that can throw side-lights on the higher teaching and practice which transformed all external rites into the discipline of inner spiritual experience. </p>
 
 <p>The following prayers, which, as far as I know, have not been previously translated, are rendered from the most recently revised texts of Reitzenstein, who has omitted the magic names, and emended the previous editions. I cannot but think, however, that these texts might be submitted to a more searching analysis than has yet been accorded them. They seem to present somewhat similar phenomena to the recensions of the Book of the Dead; that is to say, fragments of material from the tradition of a greater past have been adapted and overworked for the needs of a lesser age. Indeed, the whole effort of the Trismegistic schools seems to have been to restore the memory of that greater past; it had been forgotten, and its dim record had become a superstition instead of a living faith, a degenerate magic instead of a potent theurgy. The theurgy of our prayers is that of dwarfs; the theurgy of the past was believed to have been that of giants. </p>

 <p>in its theurgic phase. In it Hermes is regarded as the Mind <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">1</font></a> or Logos. The Mind is invoked to enter the mind and heart (I. 10). <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">2</font></a> With the shining out of the Mind, the Spiritual or Intelligible Light shines forth in the world and man (v. 3). The Mind is thus the guide of souls. <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">3</font></a> He is also identified with the Good Daimon (of whom Chnuphis or Horus are variants), with the Great Ocean, the Heaven-Space or Celestial Nile, the Great Green, the Light, the Æon. </p>
 
 <p>In connection with the above invocations Reitzenstein gives the text of a very interesting ritual of lower theurgy, or rite of the sacred flame, which he characterises by the term “mystery of lychnomancy or lamp-magic.” This is the lower side of such high vision as is referred to in “The Shepherd of Men” treatise and in the rite described in the following passage of the <i>Pistis Sophia,</i> 272, 373: </p>
 
 <p>“Jesus said unto his disciples: Come unto me! And </p>

 <p>they came unto him. He turned to the four quarters of the world, and spake the Great Name over their heads, and blessed them, and breathed on their eyes. </p>
 
 <p>“Jesus said unto them: Look, see what ye may see! </p>
 
 <p>“And lifting up their eyes they saw a great Light, exceeding vast, which no dweller on earth could describe. </p>
 
 <p>“He said to them again: Gaze into the Light, and see what ye may see! </p>
 
 <p>“They said: We see fire and water, and wine and blood.” </p>

Reitzenstein (p. 18) says rightly, as we have seen, that Egyptologists have long recognised that the God here identified with Agathodaimon was originally the Hermes or Thoth of Hermopolis Magna, Lord of the Eight Wardens (the Ogdoad), symbolised by apes, hymned by the Muses (? the Nine or Ennead), and spouse of Isis-Righteousness (<i>cf.</i> Plut., <i>De Is. et Os.,</i> iii.).</p>

In all am I scattered [that is, the Logos as seed or “members”], and whencesoever thou wiliest, thou gatherest Me; and gathering Me, thou gatherest Thyself.” (From the <i>Gospel of Eve,</i> quoted by Epiphanius, <i>Hæres</i>., xxvi. 3.) <i>Cf.</i> II. 7.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_147"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_147">86:8</a> This is an echo of spiritual rebirth or regeneration.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_150"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_150">87:2</a> The symbols of which are: the ibis in the east, ape in the west, the serpent in the north, the wolf (or jackal) in the south. So says the overworking of the text; but perhaps wolf should rather be dog.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_151"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_151">87:3</a> The terebinth, or turpentine palm. Compare this with the story of Terebinthus, from whose <i>four</i> Books Manes is said, in the <i>Acta Archelai,</i> to have derived his system.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_152"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_152">87:4</a> The ebony; perhaps symbolic of the “dark” wisdom, the initiation “in the black” of the <i>K. K.</i> Fragments.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_155">87:7</a> Lit., with Agathodaimon; compare σὺν θεῷ—“with Gods blessing.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_156">88:1</a> συνδωκόντων—a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον—δώκω (δίδωμι) may be compared with στήκω (ἵστημι). The image may be taken from the well-known symbolical representation of the sun sending forth rays, each furnished with a hand for giving and blessing, especially in the frescoes of the Atem-cult period. <i>Cf. K. K.,</i> 11 and 31.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_157"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_157">88:2</a> In the mystery-myth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_158"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_158">88:3</a> Orig., medicines or philtres.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_159"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_159">88:4</a> εὐδιάλεκτος γενοῦ—a unique and inelegant expression in Greek, and of uncertain translation into English.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_160"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_160">88:5</a> This appears here to refer to Anubis, the “dog” of Hades, or the “death-genius,” the attendant on Thoth. “Black” is lit. “Ethiopian.” But compare in <i>Pistis Sophia,</i> 367, “Æthiopic Ariouth,” a ruler among the infernal daimonials, who is “entirely black.” The Ethiopians were famous for their sorcery and black magic. They were the traditional opponents of the “white magicians” of Egypt. Compare “Hor, son of the Negress” in the “Second Story of Khamuas,” in Griffiths (F. Ll.) <i>Stories of the High Priests of Memphis</i> (Oxford, 1900), pp. 51 ff.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_161">89:1</a> This is not necessarily a prayer for physical form and the rest, but a prayer that the subtle <i>ka</i> of the man, the plastic soul-substance, may take a form of power and beauty, in the unseen world.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_162">89:2</a> εἴδωλον, or image or double. The theurgist is endeavouring to identify his <i>ka</i> with that of the god. It was with his <i>ka</i> also, presumably, that the consecrated statue of the god was “animated.” Compare the exposition of this theory as given in <i>P. S. A.,</i> and the “image” or “likeness of God” in Lactantius, ii. 10. According to the Egyptians, man possessed: (1) a physical body (<i>khat</i>); (2) a soul (<i>ba</i>); (3) a heart (<i>ȧb</i>); (4) a double (<i>ka</i>); (5) an intelligence (<i>khu</i>); (6) a power (<i>sekhem</i>); (7) a shadow (<i>khaibit</i>) (8) a spiritual body (<i>sȧḥ</i> [<i>sic</i>]); (9) a name (<i>ren</i>). See Budge, <i>Gods of the Egyptians,</i> ii. 299, 300. These are, of course, not arranged in any natural order or in a scientific distribution. The precise meaning of most of these terms is not known. Budge (<i>op. cit.,</i> i. 163, 164), however, writes: “Related intimately to the body, but with undefined functions, as far as we can discover, was the <i>sekhem,</i> a word which has been translated power, and form, and even vital force; finally the glorified body, to which had been united the soul, and spirit and power, and name of the deceased, had its abode in heaven. This new body of the deceased in heaven was called <i>sāḥu</i>.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_163"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_163">89:3</a> Thoth and Maāt are represented as sitting on either side of Rā in his boat.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_164">90:1</a> That is, Hermes as the cosmic Logos.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_165"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_165">90:2</a> Thoth changes his form in every heaven-space or sphere. Compare <i>C. H.,</i> i. 13; and also the same idea in the descent of the Christos in a number of Gnostic systems, where the Saviour and King conceals himself in the forms of his servants in every phase of his descent. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>C. H.,</i> xi. (xii.) 16.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_166">90:3</a> θαύθ.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_167">90:4</a> That is, essence, or may be type.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_168">90:5</a> Presumably a symbol for air.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_169"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_169">90:6</a> Presumably a symbol for earth.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_170">90:7</a> Compare <i>C. H.,</i> xi. (xii.) 20; and <i>P. S. A.,</i> vi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_171">91:1</a> With the Egyptians, Darkness was the mystery of all mysteries. As Damascius (<i>On First Principles</i>) says: “Of the first principle the Egyptians said nothing; but characterised it as a darkness beyond all intellectual conception, a thrice unknown Darkness” (σκότος ἄγνωστον τρὶς τοῦτο ἐπιφημίζοντες). See my <i>Orpheus</i> (London, 1896), p. 93, and for “Night,” pp. 154 and 170 ff. Perhaps this may again give some clue to the initiation “in the black” of the <i>K. K.</i> excerpt. The “dark wisdom” was the hidden of the hidden.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_172"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_172">91:2</a> αἰὼν αἰῶνος. In another hymn, Hermes, as Logos, is called “Cosmos of cosmos” (R. 23, n. 1)—that is, the spiritual world or order.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_173"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_173">91:3</a> That is the spiritual cosmos, or cosmos of Mind.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_174"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_174">91:4</a> Compare Isaiah xlv. 7: “I form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.” <i>Cf. C. H.,</i> i. 23, “the avenging daimon”; and <i>ibid.,</i> 15, “Within the Harmony he hath become a slave.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_175"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_175">91:5</a> Called in the Trismegistic literature the “Religion of the Mind” (<i>Mentis religio</i>). See <i>P. S. A.,</i> xxv.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_176"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_176">92:1</a> Compare the cosmogony in Dieterich, <i>Abraxas,</i> 17, 43: “Through the Bitterness of God, there appeared Mind . . . that restrains the heart, and was called Hermes.” With this peculiar phrase “Bitterness of God” compare the “Bitter Chaos” of the hymn at the end of the J. source of the Naassene Document in “The Myth of Man” chapter; also the “Bitter Water” or Chaos of the Sethian System (Hipp., <i>Philos.,</i> v. 19); so also Julian, in <i>Oration V.,</i> who writes: “The oracles of the gods declare that through purification not only our soul but also our bodies are judged worthy of being greatly helped and preserved, for it is said in them that the mortal vesture of bitter matter is preserved.” Is it thus possible that the “Bitterness” of Jacob Böhme may be a reminiscence of the ancient Gnosis?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_177"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_177">92:2</a> For pure Egyptian parallels see R. 24, n. 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_178"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_178">92:3</a> See the theogony in Dieterich, <i>op. cit.,</i> 18, 75: “And the soul came into being. And God said: Thou shalt move all things . . . Hermes guiding thee.” Compare <i>C. H.,</i> x. (xi.) 21: “But on the pious soul the Mind doth mount, and guide it to the Gnosis light;” also xii. (xiii.) 12, ix. (x.) 10, iv. (v.) 11, vii. (viii.) 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_179"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_179">93:1</a> These rubrics I have added, following the example of Reitzenstein, but not his wording.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_180"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_180">93:2</a> Compare the expression “Jesus the living [one]” found frequently in the Introduction to the “First Book of Ieou” (Carl Schmidt, <i>Gnostische Schriften in koptischer Sprache aus dem Codex Brucianus</i> (Leipzig, 1892), 142-145—reprinted with his recent translation of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> in Band I. of his <i>Koptisch gnostische Schriften</i> (Leipzig, 1905); and also the Preface to the newest found <i>logoi</i>: “These are the . . . words which Jesus, the living [one], spake” (Grenfell and Hunt, <i>New Sayings of Jesus,</i> London, 1904).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_181"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_181">93:3</a> Compare in the same writings the oft-repeated “Father of all fatherhood, Boundless Light.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_182"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_182">94:1</a> See Dieterich, <i>Jahrb. f. Phil.,</i> Suppl., xvi. 802, 171, and 706. Compare also Ephes. iii. 18, and the Valentinian interpretation of the terms in this text as given by Hippolytus, <i>Philos.,</i> vi. 34 (Dunker and Schneidewin, p. 248); also the interpretation of the Light Hymn in <i>Pistis Sophia,</i> 146, where the “height” is identified with the “home” of the Light.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_183"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_183">94:2</a> The magic names of power are omitted, as in the other prayers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_184"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_184">94:3</a> Horus is often represented as pilot of the sun-ship in its voyage across the ocean of space, the “Great Green.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_185"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_185">94:4</a> The dragon here undoubtedly meaning darkness. <i>Cf. C. H.,</i> i. 4.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_186"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_186">95:1</a> ὡς κυνοκέφαλος. Can it be possible that behind this strange symbolism there may once have been some such idea as this—that as the ape is to man, so was this great elemental to the God?</p>
 <p><a name="fn_187"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_187">95:2</a> Lit., art seated on the head of cosmos.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_188"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_188">95:3</a> That is the Eternity or Æon, called elsewhere the Pleroma or “fullness of grace,” and identified with Agathodaimon (see prayer, R. 30). See also Wessely, <i>op. cit.,</i> 185 (R. 362); and compare John i. 14, “full of grace and truth”; and 16, “Of his fullness have we received, and grace for grace.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_189"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_189">95:4</a> The regenerate, or spirit-born—that is of “virgin-birth” or the “birth of Horus.” But compare the declaration of the soul on its entrance into the unseen world after death, as given on an inscription found in the tomb of an Orphic or Pythagorean initiate, at Petilia, in what was once Magna Græcia: “Of Earth and starry Heaven child am I; my race is of the Heavens!” (See <i>Inscr. Gr. Siciliæ et Italiæ,</i> 638; and my “Notes on the Eleusinian Mysteries,” <i>Theosophical Review,</i> xxii. 317.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_190"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_190">95:5</a> These are the <i>logoi</i> hidden in the hearts of all.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_191"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_191">95:6</a> This may be merely a figurative expression in praise of the might that can not only dissolve the most stable things on earth, but also set in motion the centre of stability of spiritual essences; or it may refer to the idea of the “God born from the rock,” which is most familiar to us from the Mithriac mystery-tradition, where the rock is said to symbolise in physics the “firmament,” which was thought of as solid or rigid by the ancients.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_192"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_192">95:7</a> That is, the seven cosmic spheres.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_193"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_193">96:1</a> μεμνοινην—an untranslatable reading. Is it Egyptian?—or is it intended for μεμνόνειαν? If the latter, it would presumably be connected with the Egyptian myth and cult of Memnon (see Roschers <i>Lexikon,</i> coll. 2661 ff.). The Memnon cult was somehow connected with Hermes, for in the ruins of the temple were still (at the beginning of the third century) to be seen “statues of Hermes,” according to Philostratus (<i>Vit. Apoll.,</i> vi. 4), who also (<i>Imag.,</i> i. 7) tells us that the Memnon statue was as a lyre which was struck by the rod (πλῆκτρον), that is the ray (ἡ ἀκτίς), of the sun. If so, “the rod [of power], by which thou sendest forth the gods,” that is thy rays, each god being a ray of the spiritual sun, might have the epithet Memnonian applied to it. But in our present lack of information, this interpretation seems very strained.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_198"></a><a href="th107.htm#fr_198">98:2</a> This refers to the first nome of Upper Egypt, whose metropolis, Elephantine, was once the chief seat of the popular Agathodaimon cult (R. 29, n. 4). The “world” was thus the Egyptian civilised world, beyond which was the darkness of Ethiopia.</p>
