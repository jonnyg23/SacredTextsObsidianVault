 <h5 align="center">ADDRESS TO KLEA CONCERNING GNOSIS AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH <a name="fr_780"></a><a href="#fn_781"><font size="1">1</font></a> </h5>
 
 <p>I. 1. <a name="fr_781"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">2</font></a> While all who have mind, O Klea, should ask for all their blessings from the Gods—let <i>us,</i> by pursuing after them, pray to obtain from them those [blessings] of gnosis <a name="fr_782"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">3</font></a> concerning them, as far as tis within the reach of men; in that theres nothing greater for a man to get, nor more majestic for a God to give, than Truth. </p>
 
 <p>2. Of other things their God <i>gives</i> men what they require, whereas of mind and wisdom He <i>gives a share</i> <a name="fr_783"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">4</font></a> to them—since He [Himself] possesses these and uses [them]. </p>
 
 <p>For the Divine is neither blest through silver and through gold, nor strong through thunderings and lightnings, but [blest and strong] by gnosis and by wisdom. </p>
 
 <p>3. And thus most finely of all things which he hath said about the Gods—sounding aloud: </p>
 
 <p></p><blockquote><span style="font-size: small">Yea have they both a common source and one [fair] native land;<br>But Zeus came into being first and he knew more—</span></blockquote>
 
 <p>hath Homer made pronouncement of the primacy of Zeus as more majestic, in that in gnosis and in wisdom it <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">5</font></a> is older. </p>
 
 <p>4. Nay, I believe that the good fortune of æonian life—the which the God hath gotten for his lot—is </p>

 <p>that by reason of His gnosis the things in genesis should not entirely die; for when the knowing of existing things and being wise is taken from it, freedom from death is Time—not Life. </p>
