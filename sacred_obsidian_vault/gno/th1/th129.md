 <h5 align="center">CONCERNING SARAPIS</h5>
 
 <p>4. For they say that Sarapis is no other than Pluto, and Isis Persephassa, as Archemachus of Eubœa has said, <a name="fr_1029"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">3</font></a> and Heracleides of Pontus, when he supposes that the seat of the oracle at Canopus is Plutos. </p>
 
 <p>XXVIII. 1. And Ptolemy the Saviour <a name="fr_1030"></a><a href="#fn_1031"><font size="1">4</font></a> saw in a dream the gigantic statue of Pluto—though he had not previously seen or known what form it was—ordering him to bring it to Alexandria. </p>

 </p>

 <p>2. And when he did not know and had no idea where [the statue] was set up even after he had described his vision to his friends, there was found a man, a great traveller, by name Sōsibius, who said he had seen at Sinope just such a colossus as the King seemed to have seen. </p>
 
 <p>3. He [Ptolemy] accordingly sent Sōtelēs and Dionysius, who, after expending much time and pains, not, however, without the help of Gods providence, removed it secretly and brought it away. </p>
 
 <p>4. And when it had been brought [to Alexandria] and set up publicly, the assistants of Timotheus, the interpreter, and of Manethōs, the Sebennyte, coming to the conclusion that it was a statue of Pluto—judging by its cerberus and huge serpent—convinced Ptolemy that it was that of no other of the Gods than Sarapis; for it did not come from Sinopē with this designation, but after it had been brought to Alexandria it received the Egyptian name for Pluto, namely, Sarapis. </p>
 
 <p>5. And yet people sink into the opinion of Heracleitus the physicist, when he says: “Hades <a name="fr_1031"></a><a href="#fn_1032"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Dionysus are the same, for whomsoever they rage and riot.” </p>
 
 <p>For those who postulate that Hades means the body, because the soul is as it were deranged and drunken in it, put forward a [too] meagre interpretation. </p>
 
 <p>6. But [it is] better to identify Osiris with Dionysus, and Sarapis <a name="fr_1032"></a><a href="#fn_1033"><font size="1">2</font></a> with Osiris, so designated after he had changed his nature. <a name="fr_1033"></a><a href="#fn_1034"><font size="1">3</font></a> Wherefore “Sarapis” is common to all, <a name="fr_1034"></a><a href="#fn_1035"><font size="1">4</font></a> just as, you know, those who share in the sacred rites know that “Osiris” is. </p>
 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>
 
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></a></p>
 
 <p>XXIX. 1. For it is not worth while paying attention to the Phrygian writings, in which Isis is said to have been the daughter of Charops, <a name="fr_1035"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">1</font></a> son of Heracles, and Typhon [son] of Æacus, <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">2</font></a> [also] son of Heracles. </p>
 
 <p>2. Nor [is it worth while] refraining from disregarding Phylarchus, <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">3</font></a> when he writes that “it was Dionysus who first brought two oxen from India to Egypt, of which the name of one was Apis, and of the other Osiris; and <i>Sarapis</i> is the name of Him who orders [or adorns] the universe from <i>sairein</i> [sweep, clean], which some say [means] beautifying and adorning”;—for these [remarks] of Phylarchus are absurd. </p>
 
 <p>3. But still more so are those of them who say that Sarapis is not a god, but that the coffin of Apis <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1039"><font size="1">4</font></a> is thus named, and that certain brazen gates at Memphis, called “Gates of Oblivion and Wailing,” open with a deep mournful sound, when they bury Apis, and that therefore at every sounding of brass <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1040"><font size="1">5</font></a> we are plunged into oblivion. </p>
 
 <p>4. More moderate are they who claim that the </p>

 <p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></a></p>
 
 <p>simultaneous motion of the universe is thus called [<i>sc. Sarapis</i>], from <i>seuesthai</i> and <i>sousthai</i> <a name="fr_1040"></a><a href="#fn_1041"><font size="1">1</font></a> [“speed”]. </p>
 
 <p>5. But the majority of the priests say that “Osiris” and “Apis” have been woven together into the same [name], explaining and teaching that we should look on the Apis as an en-formed image of the soul of Osiris. </p>
 
 <p>6. If, however, the name of Sarapis is Egyptian, I for my part think it denotes “Good Cheer” and “Delight,”—finding a proof in the fact that Egyptians call the feast “Delights”—<i>Sairei.</i> </p>
 
 <p>And, indeed, Plato says that Hades has been so called as being “sweet” <a name="fr_1041"></a><a href="#fn_1042"><font size="1">2</font></a> and gentle to those with him. </p>
 
 <p>7. And with Egyptians both many other of their names are <i>logoi,</i> <a name="fr_1042"></a><a href="#fn_1043"><font size="1">3</font></a> and they call subterrene space, to which they think the souls depart after death, Amenthē—the name signifying “the [space] which takes and gives.” <a name="fr_1043"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">4</font></a> </p>
 
 <p>8. But whether this, too, is one of the names that left Hellas long ago and have been brought back again, <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1045"><font size="1">5</font></a> we will examine later on; for the present, let us continue with the remaining [points] of the belief we have in hand. </p>

In the myths, cymbals were said to have been used to protect the infant Bacchus, and infant Zeus, and to keep off the Titans—so, presumably, plunging them into oblivion. Compare also 1 Corinth. xiii. 1, where Paul, speaking of the exercise of the “gift of tongues” (<i>glossalaly</i>) without love (ἀγάπη), uses precisely the same term, when saying: “I am become as sounding brass (χαλκὸς ἠχῶν) or tinkling cymbal” the latter being, perhaps, a reference to the <i>sistrum,</i> while the former is perhaps a metaphor, derived from the hardness and colour (“red”) of brass, or rather bronze or copper, referring to a state of mind which plunges us into oblivion of our better part—namely, spiritual love.</p>
