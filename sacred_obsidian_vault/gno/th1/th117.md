 <h5 align="center">OF THE REFRAINING FROM FLESH AND SALT AND SUPERFLUITIES </h5>
 
 <p>V. 1. And the priests handle so hardly <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">1</font></a> the nature of superfluities, that they not only deprecate the many kinds of pulse, and of meats the sheep-flesh <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">2</font></a> kinds and swine-flesh kinds, as making much superfluity, but also at their times of purification they remove the salts from the grains, <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">3</font></a> having other further reasons as well as the fact that it makes the more thirsty and more hungry sharpen their desire the more. </p>
 
 <p>2. For to argue that salts are not pure owing to the multitude of small lives <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">4</font></a> that are caught <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">5</font></a> and die in them when they solidify themselves, as Aristagoras said, <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">6</font></a> is naïve. </p>
 
 <p>3. They are, moreover, said to water the Apis also from a special well, and by all means to keep him from the Nile,—not that they think His <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">7</font></a> water stained with blood because of the Crocodile, <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">8</font></a> as some think (for nothing is so precious to Egyptians as the Nile), </p>

 <p>but that the water of Niles superfluity <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">1</font></a> on being drunk seems to make fat, nay, rather to make much too much of flesh. </p>
 
 <p>4. And [so] they do not wish the Apis to be so nor yet themselves, but [wish] to wear their bodies on their souls compact and light, and neither to com-press nor op-press them by the mortal part prevailing and its weighing down of the divine. </p>
