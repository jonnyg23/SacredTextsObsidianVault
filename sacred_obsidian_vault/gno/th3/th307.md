 <p><small>(Title from Patrizzi (p. 38b); followed by: “To the Same Tat.”</small></p>
 <p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Phys</i>., viii. 41, under heading: “Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Tat”; G. p. 93; M. i. 64.</small></p>
 <p><small>Ménard, Livre IV., No. v. of “Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” p. 241.)</small></p>
 <p>1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Now</span> to find out concerning the three times; for they are neither by themselves, nor [yet] are they at-oned; and [yet] again they are at-oned, and by themselves [as well].</p>
 <p>For shouldst thou think the present is without the past, it cant be present unless it has become already past. <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>For from the past the present comes, and from the present future goes.</p>
 <p>But if we have to scrutinize more closely, thus let us argue:</p>
 <p>2. Past time doth pass into no longer being</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a></p>
 <p>this, <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">1</font></a> and future [time] doth not exist, in its not being present; nay, present even is not present, in its continuing.</p>
 <p>Time, then, which <i>stands</i> not [steady] (ἕστηκε), but which is on the turn, without a central point at which to stop,—how can it be called <i>in-stant</i> (ἐνεστώς), <a name="fr_84"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">2</font></a> seeing even that it hath no power to <i>stand</i> (ἑστάναι)?</p>
 <p>Again, past joining present, and present [joining] future, they [thus] are one; for they are not without them <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">3</font></a> in their sameness, and their oneness, and their continuity.</p>
 <p>Thus, [then], times both continuous and discontinuous, though one and the same [time].</p>

 <p><a name="fn_82"></a><a href="th307.htm#fr_82">28:1</a> That is, apparently, you cannot <i>think</i> of the present until it is already past.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="th307.htm#fr_83">29:1</a> That is, apparently, “present.”</p>
 <p><a name="fn_84"></a><a href="th307.htm#fr_84">29:2</a> The usual term in Greek for “present,” but I have here translated it by “instant” in order to keep the word-play, which would otherwise entirely vanish in translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_85"></a><a href="th307.htm#fr_85">29:3</a> That is, apparently, any one without the other two, or any two without the other one.</p>
