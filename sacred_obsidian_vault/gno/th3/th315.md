 <p><small>(Title from Patrizzi (p. 40); preceded by “Of Thrice-greatest Hermes,” and followed by “To the Same Ammon.”</small></p>
 <p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Phys</i>., xxxv. 9, under heading: “Of Hermes from the [Sermons] to Ammon”; G. pp. 282, 283; M. i. 196, 197; W. 281, 282.</small></p>
 <p><small>Ménard, Livre IV., No. iii. of “Fragments of the Books of Hermes to Ammon,” pp. 259, 260.)</small></p>
 <p>1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Soul is further [in itself] incorporal essence, and even when in body it by no means doth depart from the essentiality peculiar to itself.</p>
 <p>Its nature is, according to its essence to be for ever moving, according to its thought [to be] self-motive [purely], not moved in something, nor towards something, nor [yet] because of something.</p>
 <p>For it is prior [to them] in power, and prior stands not in any need of consequents.</p>
 <p>“In something,” furthermore,—means space, and time, and nature; “towards something,”—[this] means harmony, and form, and figure; “because of something,”—[this] means body, for tis because of body that there is time, and space, and nature.</p>
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p>
 <p>Now all these things are in connection with each other by means of a congenital relationship.</p>
 <p>2. For instance, now, the body must have space, for it would be past all contriving that a body should exist without a space.</p>
 <p>It changes, too, in nature, and tis impossible for change to be apart from time, and from the movement nature makes; nor is it further possible for there to be composing of a body apart from harmony.</p>
 <p>It is because of body, then, that space exists; for that by its reception of the changes of the body, it does not let a thing thats changing pass away.</p>
 <p>But, changing, it doth alternate from one thing to another, and is deprived of being in a permanent condition, but not of being body.</p>
 <p>For body, <i>quâ</i> body, remains body; but any special moment of its state does not remain.</p>
 <p>The body, then, keeps changing in its states.</p>
 <p>3. And so, space is incorporal, and time, and natural motion; but each of these has naturally its own peculiar property.</p>
 <p>The property of space is receptivity; of time [tis] interval and number; of nature [it is] motion; of harmony [tis] love; of body, change.</p>
 <p>The special nature of the Soul, however, is essential thought. <a name="fr_213"></a><a href="#fn_213"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
