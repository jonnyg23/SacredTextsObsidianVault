 <p></p><h3 align="center">OF ENERGY AND FEELING</h3>
 <p><small>(Title from Patrizzi (p. 44); preceded by “Of Thrice-greatest Hermes.”</small></p>
 <p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Phys.</i>, xxxv. 6, under the heading: “From the [Sermons] to Tat”; G. pp. 284-291; M. i. 198-203; W. i. 284-289.</small></p>
 <p><small>Ménard, Livre IV., No. ii. of “Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 231-237.)</small></p>
 <p>1. <i>Tat</i>. Rightly hast thou explained these things, O father [mine]. Now give me further teaching as to those.</p>
 <p>For thou hast said somewhere <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">1</font></a> that science and that art do constitute the rationals energy. <a name="fr_94"></a><a href="#fn_94"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>But now thou sayst that the irrational lives, <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">3</font></a> through deprivation of the rational, are and are called <i>ir</i>-rational.</p>
 <p>According to this reasoning, [therefore], it follows of necessity that the irrational lives are</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a></p>
 <p>without any share in science or in art, through deprivation of the rational.</p>
 <p>2. <i>Her</i>. [It follows] of necessity, [my] son.</p>
 <p><i>Tat</i>. How, then, O father, do we see some of irrational [creatures] using [both] intelligence, and art?—the ants, for instance, storing their food for winter, and in like fashion, [too,] the creatures of the air building their nests, and the four-footed beasts [each] knowing their own holes. <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p><i>Her</i>. These things they do, O son, neither by science nor by art, but by [the force of] nature.</p>
 <p>Science and art are teachable; but none of these irrationals is taught a thing.</p>
 <p>Things done by nature are [so] done by reason of the general energy of things.</p>
 <p>Things [done] by art and science are achieved by those who know, [and] not by all.</p>
 <p>Things done by all are brought into activity <a name="fr_97"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">2</font></a> by nature.</p>
 <p>3. For instance, all look up [to heaven]; but all [are] not musicians, or [are] all archers, or hunters, or the rest.</p>
 <p>But some of them have learned one thing,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> [others another thing], science and art being active <a name="fr_98"></a><a href="#fn_98"><font size="1">1</font></a> [in them].</p>
 <p>In the same way, if some ants only did this thing, and others not, thou wouldst have rightly said they acted by [the light] of science, and stored their food by means of art.</p>
 <p>But if they all without distinction are driven by their nature to [do] this, though [it may be] against their will,—tis plain they do not do it or by science or by art.</p>
 <p>4. For Tat, these energies, though [in themselves] they are incorporal, are [found] in bodies, and act through bodies.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, O Tat, in that they are incorporal, thou sayest that they are immortal; but, in so far as without bodies they cannot manifest activity, <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_99"><font size="1">2</font></a> I say that they are ever in a body.</p>
 <p>Things once called into being for some purpose, or some cause, things that come under Providence and Fate, can never stay inactive of their proper energy.</p>
 <p>For that which is, shall ever be; for that this [being] is [the very] body and the life of it.</p>
 <p>5. It follows from this reason, [then,] that these are always bodies.</p>
 <p>Wherefore I say that “bodying” <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_100"><font size="1">3</font></a> itself is an eternal [exercise of] energy.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a></p>
 <p>If bodies are on earth, theyre subject unto dissolution; yet must these [ever] be [on earth to serve] as places and as organs for the energies.</p>
 <p>The energies, however, [are] immortal, and the immortal is eternally,—[that is, that] body-making, if it ever is, <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">1</font></a> is energy.</p>
 <p>6. [The energies] accompany the soul, though not appearing all at once.</p>
 <p>Some of them energize the man the moment that hes born, united with the soul round its irrational [parts]; whereas the purer ones, with change of age, <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">2</font></a> co-operate with the souls rational part.</p>
 <p>But all these energies depend on bodies. From godly <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">3</font></a> bodies they descend to mortal [frames], these body-making [energies]; each one of them is [ever] active, either around the body or the soul.</p>
 <p>Yea, they are active with the soul itself without a body. They are for ever in activity.</p>
 <p>The soul, however, is not for ever in a <i>mortal</i> body, for it can be without the <i>body</i>; whereas the energies can never be without the <i>bodies</i>.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a></p>
 <p>This is a sacred saying (<i>logos</i>), son: Body apart from soul cannot persist; its being can. <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>7. <i>Tat</i>. What dost thou mean, O father [mine]?</p>
 <p><i>Her</i>. Thus understand it, Tat! When soul leaves body, body itself remains.</p>
 <p>But [even] the body so abandoned, <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">2</font></a> as long as it remains, is in activity, being broken up and made to disappear.</p>
 <p>For body without [the exercise of] energy could not experience these things. <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">3</font></a></p>
 <p>This energy, accordingly, continues with the body when the soul has gone.</p>
 <p>This, therefore, is the difference of an immortal body and a mortal one,—that the immortal doth consist of a one single matter, but this [body does] not.</p>
 <p>The formers active, and the latters passive.</p>
 <p>For every thing that maketh active is the stronger; and [every thing] that is made active is the weaker.</p>
 <p>The stronger, too, being in authority and free, doth lead; the [weaker] follows [as] a slave.</p>
 <p>8. The energies, then, energize not only bodies that are ensouled, but also [bodies] unensouled,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> —stocks, stones, <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">1</font></a> and all such things;—both making [them] to grow, and to bear fruits, and ripening [them], dissolving, melting, rotting and crumbling [them], and setting up [in them] all like activities which bodies without souls can undergo.</p>
 <p>For energys <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">2</font></a> the name, O son, for just the thing thats going on,—that is becoming.</p>
 <p>And many things needs must for ever be becoming; nay, rather, all things [must].</p>
 <p>For never is Cosmos bereft of any of existent things, but being borne <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">3</font></a> for aye in its own self, it bears existent things,—[things] that shall never cease from being destroyed again. <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>
 <p>9. Know, then, that energy of every kind is ever free from death,—no matter what it is, or in what body.</p>
 <p>And of the energies, some are of godly bodies, and some of those which are corruptible; some [are] general, and some special. Some [are] of genera, and some are of the parts of every genus.</p>
 <p>The godly ones, [accordingly], are those that exercise their energies through everlasting bodies. And these are perfect [energies], in that [they energize] through perfect bodies.</p>
 <p>But partial [energies are] those [that energize] through each one of the [single] living things.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a></p>
 <p>And special [energies are those that energize] through each one of existent things.</p>
 <p>10. This argument, accordingly, O son, deduces that all things are full of energies.</p>
 <p>For though it needs must be that energies should be in bodies,—and there be many bodies in the Cosmos,—I say that energies are many more than bodies.</p>
 <p>For often in one body there is [found] one, and a second and a third [activity],—not counting in the general ones that come with it.</p>
 <p>By general ones I mean the purely corporal ones, that exercise themselves through the sensations <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a> and the motions [of the body].</p>
 <p>For that without these energies the body [of an animal] can not persist.</p>
 <p>11. The souls of men, however, have a second class of energies,—the special ones [that exercise themselves] through arts, and sciences, and practices, and [purposed] doings. <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>
 <p>For that the feelings <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">3</font></a> follow on the energies or rather are completions <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">4</font></a> of the energies.</p>
 <p>Know, then, O son, the difference of energy and of sensation.</p>
 <p>[Thus] energy is sent down from above; whereas sensation, being in the body and having its existence from it, receives the energy</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a></p>
 <p>and makes it manifest, as though it did embody it.</p>
 <p>Wherefore I say sensations are both corporal and mortal, and last as long as doth the body [only].</p>
 <p>Nay, rather, its sensations are born together with the body, and they die with it.</p>
 <p>12. But the immortal bodies in themselves have no sensation,—[not even an] immortal [one], as though they were composed out of some essence of some kind.</p>
 <p>For that sensation doth arise entirely from naught else than either from the bad or else the good thats added to the body, or that is, on the contrary, taken [from it] again.</p>
 <p>But with eternal bodies there is no adding to nor taking from.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, sensation doth not occur in them.</p>
 <p>13. <i>Tat</i>. Is, then, sensation felt in every body?</p>
 <p><i>Her</i>. In every body, son; and energies are active in all [bodies, too].</p>
 <p><i>Tat</i>. Even in bodies without souls, O father [mine]?</p>
 <p><i>Her</i>. Even in them, O son. There are, however, differences in the sensations.</p>
 <p>The feelings of the rationals occur with reason; those of irrationals are simply corporal; as for the things that have no soul, they [also] have</p>
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>
 <p>sensations, but passive ones,—experience of increase [only] and decrease. <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>Moreover, passion and sensation depend from one [same] head, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">2</font></a> and they are gathered up again into the same, and that, too, by the energies.</p>
 <p>14. Of lives <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">3</font></a> with souls there are two other energies which go with the sensations and the passions,—grief and joy.</p>
 <p>And without these, an ensouled life, and most of all a rational one, could not experience sensation.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, I say that there are forms of passions,—[and] forms that dominate the rational lives more [than the rest].</p>
 <p>The energies, then, are the active forces [in sensations], while the sensations are the indications of the energies.</p>
 <p>15. Further, as these <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">4</font></a> are corporal, theyre set in motion by the irrational parts of [a mans] soul; wherefore, I say that both of them are mischievous.</p>
 <p>For that both joy, though [for the moment] it provides sensation joined with pleasure, immediately becomes a cause of many ills <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">5</font></a> to</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a></p>
 <p>him who feeleth it; while grief [itself] provides [still] greater pains and suffering.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, they both would seem [most] mischievous.</p>
 <p>16. <i>Tat</i>. Can, then, sensation be the same in soul and body, father [mine]?</p>
 <p><i>Her</i>. How dost thou mean,—sensation in the soul, [my] son?</p>
 <p><i>Tat</i>. Surely it cannot be that souls incorporal, and that sensation is a body, father,—sensation which is sometimes in a body and sometimes not, [just as the soul]?</p>
 <p><i>Her</i>. If we should put it <i>in</i> a body, son, we should [then] represent it as like the soul or [like] the energies. For that we say these <a name="fr_120"></a><a href="#fn_120"><font size="1">1</font></a> are incorporals in bodies.</p>
 <p>But [as] sensations neither energy nor soul, nor any other thing than body, according to what has been said above, it cannot, therefore, be incorporal.</p>
 <p>And if its not incorporal, it must be body.</p>
 <p>For of existing things some must be bodies and the rest incorporal.</p>

 <p></p><h4 align="center">COMMENT</h4>
 <p>Again, as with the last excerpt, the earlier editions of Stobæus have Asclepius and Tat as the persons of</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a></p>
 <p>the dialogue instead of Hermes and Tat. Wachsmuth gives them correctly.</p>
 <p>The second sentence is of great interest, for it refers us presumably to <i>C. H.</i>, x. (xi.), 22: “Gods rays, to use a figure, are his energies; the Cosmoss are natures; the arts and sciences are mans.” Seeing, however, that “The Key” is an Epitome of the General Sermons to Tat, the statement may also have been made in one of these sermons.</p>
 <p>In either case the existence of these General Sermons is presupposed, and, therefore, it may be that our excerpt is, again, one of the Expository Sermons to Tat.</p>
 <p>The beginning of the Sermon has clearly been omitted by Stobæus, and apparently the end also.</p>
