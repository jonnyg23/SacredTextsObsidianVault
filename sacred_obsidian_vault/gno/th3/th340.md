 <p></p><h5 align="center">HERMES SPEAKS OF THE TRINITY</h5>
 <p>Hermes the Thrice-greatest.—He was an Egyptian sage, and flourished before Pharaoh. He was called Thrice-greatest because he spoke of the Trinity, declaring that in the Trinity there is One Godhead, as follows:</p>
 <p>“Before Intellectual Light was Light Intellectual; Mind of mind, too, was there eternally, Light-giving. There was naught else except the Oneness of this [Mind] and Spirit all-embracing.</p>
 <p>“Without this is nor god, nor angel, nor any other being. For He is Lord and Father, and the God of all; and all things are beneath Him, [all things are] in Him. <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Cyril, <i>C. J</i>., i. 35 (Fragg. xvi., xvii.), of which a very garbled edition is reproduced. The same statement and passage is also quoted by Cedrenus, John Malalas, and the author of the <i>Chronicum Alexandrinum</i>. See Bernhardys edition of Suidas (Halle, 1853), i. 527, notes.) Suidas then continues without a break:)</p>
 <p>“His Word (<i>Logos</i>), all-perfect as he was, and fecund, and creative, falling in fecund Nature, yea in fecund Water, made Water pregnant.” <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>After saying this he has the following prayer:</p>
 <p></p><h5 align="center">AN ORPHIC HYMN</h5>
 <p>“Thee, Heaven, I adjure, wise work of mighty God; thee I adjure, Word <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the Father which He spake first, when He established all the world!</p>
 <p>“Thee I adjure, [O Heaven], by the alone-begotten Word (<i>Logos</i>) himself, and by the Father of the Word alone-begotten, yea, by the Father who surroundeth all,—be gracious, be gracious!”</p>
 <p></p><hr> 
 <p>This is not a prayer from Hermes, but three verses (the last somewhat altered) of an Orphic hymn excerpted from Cyril, <i>ibid</i>., i. 33 (Migne, col. 552 C),—lines also attributed to “Orpheus” by Justin Martyr. The last half of the prayer seems to be a pure invention of Suidas, or of his editor, based partially on Cyrils comments.</p>
