 <p></p><hr> 
 <p></p><h3 align="center">[OF THE INEFFABILITY OF GOD]</h3>
 <p><small>(I have added the title, the excerpt not being found in Patrizzi.</small></p>
 <p><small>Text: Stob., <i>Flor</i>., lxxx. [lxxviii.] 9, under the heading: “Of Hermes from the [Book] to Tat”; G. iii. 135; M. iii. 104, 105. <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">1</font></a></small></p>
 <p><small>Ménard, Livre IV., No. x. of “Fragments from the Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” p. 256.)</small></p>
 <p>[<i>Her</i>.] To understand <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">2</font></a> God is difficult, to speak [of Him] impossible.</p>
 <p>For that the Bodiless can never be expressed in body, the Perfect never can be comprehended by that which is imperfect, and that tis difficult for the Eternal to company with the ephemeral.</p>
 <p>The one is for ever, the other doth pass; the one is in [the clarity of] Truth, the other in the shadow of appearance.</p>
 <p>So far off from the stronger [is] the weaker,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a></p>
 <p>the lesser from the greater [is so far], as [is] the mortal [far] from the Divine.</p>
 <p>It is the distance, then, between the two that dims the Vision of the Beautiful.</p>
 <p>For tis with eyes that bodies can be seen, with tongue that things seen can be spoken of; but That which hath no body, that is unmanifest, and figureless, and is not made objective [to us] out of matter,—cannot be comprehended by our sense.</p>
 <p>I have it in my mind, O Tat, I have it in my mind, that what cannot be spoken of, is God.</p>
 <p></p><hr> 
 <p></p><h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>
 <p>Justin Martyr quotes these opening words of our excerpt <i>verbatim</i>, assigning them to Hermes (<i>Cohort</i>., 38; Otto, ii. 122). <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>The substance of the second sentence is given twice by Lactantius in Latin (<i>Div. Institt</i>., ii. 8; Ep. 4); in the second passage the Church Father also quotes verbatim the first sentence of our excerpt, and from his introductory words we learn that they were the <i>beginning</i> of a written sermon from Hermes to his son (Tat).</p>
 <p>The first four sentences are also quoted in almost identical words (there being two variants of reading and two slight additions) by Cyril,—<i>Contra Julianum</i>, i. 31 (Migne, col. 549 B), who, moreover, gives some additional lines, beginning (Frag. xi.): “If, then, there be an incorporeal eye,” etc.</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a></p>
 <p>If, furthermore, we are right in supposing that Frag. xv. (Cyril, <i>ibid</i>., i. 33) is from the same sermon, then this sermon is the “First Sermon of the Expository [Sermons] to Tat,” and the Stobæan heading, “From the [Book] to Tat,” will mean the collection of Expository Sermons (see Comment, on Frag. xv.).</p>
