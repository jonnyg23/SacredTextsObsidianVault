 <p>1. The Mithraic Lion, moving through the stars of heaven. The reverse exhibits a complete assemblage of the <i>Siglæ</i> that are found, dispersed, upon so many talismans. That they stand for the names of deities and astral Powers may be guessed from the fact that Mohammedans still express <i>Allah</i> by a circle filled up with diagonal lines.</p>  
 <p>2. Lion-headed Man, doubtless a <i>Leonticus</i> (one of the grades in the Mithraic Mysteries), uttering, with uplifted hand, the inexplicable adjuration, "O, Centaur of God, Thou match for a hundred [demons]!" Here ἑκατοντομάχος is formed after the analogy of μονομάχος, "a match for one."</p>  
 <p>3. A <i>Mobed</i> (Zoroastrian priest or <i>Magus</i>) performing his nocturnal devotions before an altar, on which are set up various <i>sacra</i>, amongst which may be recognised the regular insignia of his profession, the Sword and the Divining-rods. Engraved upon the base of a calcedony cone, an early form of the signet in Assyria.</p>  
 <p>4. Horus, the Vernal Sun-god, making the gesture of adoration, his whip resting upon his left arm. He is seated upon the seed-vessel of the lotus, that aptest symbol of the Universe, in virtue of its, innumerable contents. In the long, clearly-cut legend that fills the exergue, no hitherto-explained formulæ are to be recognised.</p>
