 <p></p><h4 align="center">VI</h4>
 <p>1. [III. M.] It is for reasons such as these, Asclepius, man is a mighty wonder,—an animal meet for our worship and for our respect.</p>
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a></p>
 <p>For he doth pass into Gods Nature, <a name="fr_698"></a><a href="#fn_697"><font size="1">1</font></a> as though himself were God. This genus [also] knows the genus of the daimons, as though man knew he had a [common] origin with them. He thinketh little of the part of human nature in him, from confidence in the divineness of [his] other part.</p>
 <p>How much more happy is the blend of human nature [than of all the rest]! Joined to the Gods by his cognate divinity, a man looks down upon the part of him by means of which hes common with the Earth.</p>
 <p>The rest of things to which he knows hes kin, by [reason of] the heavenly order [in him], he binds unto himself with bonds of love; and thus he turns his gaze to Heaven.</p>
 <p>2. So, then, [man] hath his place in the more blessed station of the Midst; so that he loves [all] those below himself, and in his turn is loved by those above.</p>
 <p>He tills the Earth. He mingles with the Elements by reason of the swiftness of his mind. He plunges into the Seas depths by means of its <a name="fr_699"></a><a href="#fn_698"><font size="1">2</font></a> profundity. He puts his values on all things.</p>
 <p>Heaven seems not too high for him; for it is</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a></p>
 <p>measured by the wisdom of his mind as though it were quite near.</p>
 <p>No darkness of the Air obstructs the penetration of his mind. No density of Earth impedes his work. No depth of Water blunts his sight. <a name="fr_700"></a><a href="#fn_699"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>[Though still] the same [yet] is he all, and everywhere is he the same.</p>
 <p>3. Of all these genera, those [species] which are animal have [many] roots, which stretch from the above below, <a name="fr_701"></a><a href="#fn_700"><font size="1">2</font></a> whereas those which are stationary <a name="fr_702"></a><a href="#fn_701"><font size="1">3</font></a>—these from [one] living root send forth a wood of branching greenery up from below into the upper parts.</p>
 <p>Moreover, some of them are nourished with a two-fold form of food, while others with a single form.</p>
 <p>Twain are the forms of food—for soul and body, of which [all] animals consist. Their soul is nourished by the ever-restless motion of the World <a name="fr_703"></a><a href="#fn_702"><font size="1">4</font></a>; their bodies have their growth from</p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></a></p>
 <p>foods [drawn] from the water and the earth of the inferior world. <a name="fr_704"></a><a href="#fn_703"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>Spirit, <a name="fr_705"></a><a href="#fn_704"><font size="1">2</font></a> with which they <a name="fr_706"></a><a href="#fn_705"><font size="1">3</font></a> all are filled, being interblended with the rest, <a name="fr_707"></a><a href="#fn_706"><font size="1">4</font></a> doth make them live; sense being added, and also reason in the case of man—which hath been given to man alone as a fifth part out of the æther.</p>
 <p>Of all the living things <a name="fr_708"></a><a href="#fn_707"><font size="1">5</font></a> [God] doth adorn, extend, exalt, the sense of man alone unto the understanding of the Reason of Divinity. <a name="fr_709"></a><a href="#fn_708"><font size="1">6</font></a></p>
 <p>But since I am impressed to speak concerning Sense, I will a little further on set forth for you the sermon on this [point]; for that it is most holy, and [most] mighty, not less than in the Reason of Divinity itself.</p>
 <p></p><h4 align="center">VII</h4>
 <p>1. But now Ill finish for you what I have begun. For I was speaking at the start of union with the Gods, by which men only <a name="fr_710"></a><a href="#fn_709"><font size="1">7</font></a> consciously enjoy <a name="fr_711"></a><a href="#fn_710"><font size="1">8</font></a> the Gods regard,—I mean whatever men have won such rapture that they have obtained a share of that Divine Sense of intelligence which</p>

 <p>

 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></a></p>
 <p>is the most <a name="fr_712"></a><a href="#fn_711"><font size="1">1</font></a> Divine of Senses, found in God and in mans reason.</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p><i>Asc.</i> Are not the senses of all men, Thrice-greatest one, the same?</p>
 <p align="center"></p><hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="25%" noshade> <p><i>Tris.</i> Nay, [my] Asclepius, all have not won true reason <a name="fr_713"></a><a href="#fn_712"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but wildly rushing in pursuit of [reasons] counterfeit, <a name="fr_714"></a><a href="#fn_713"><font size="1">3</font></a> they never see the thing itself, and are deceived. And this breeds evil in their minds, and [thus] transforms the best of animals into the nature of a beast and manners of the brutes.</p>
 <p>2. But as to Sense and all things similar, I will set forth the whole discourse when [I explain] concerning Spirit.</p>
 <p>For man is the sole animal that is twofold. One part of him is simple: the [man] “essential,” <a name="fr_715"></a><a href="#fn_714"><font size="1">4</font></a> as say the Greeks, but which we call the “form of the Divine Similitude.”</p>
 <p>He also is fourfold: that which the Greeks call “hylic,” <a name="fr_716"></a><a href="#fn_715"><font size="1">5</font></a> [but] which we call “cosmic”; of which is made the corporal part, in which is vestured what we just have said is the divine in man, <a name="fr_717"></a><a href="#fn_716"><font size="1">6</font></a>—in which the godhead of the Mind alone,</p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></a></p>
 <p>together with its kin, that is the Pure Minds senses, findeth home and rest, its self with its own self, as though shut in the bodys walls.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_697"></a><a href="th239.htm#fr_698">316:1</a> This contradicts somewhat the more careful wording of <i>C. H.</i>, x. (xi.) 1, where the term Energy is preferred.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_700"></a><a href="th239.htm#fr_701">317:2</a> Compare with this the symbolism of the “fire-tree” and the “rootage” of the æons, in the “Simonian” system of the Gnōsis, taken by Hippolytus from the document entitled <i>The Great Announcement</i> (Hipp., <i>Philos.</i>, vi. 9 and 18). Also the common figure of the Ashvattha tree of Indo-Aryan mythology; for instance, in the <i>Kaṭhopaniṣhad</i>, II. vi. 1: “The old, old tree that sees no morrows dawn, [stands] roots up, branches down” (see Mead and Chaṭṭopādhyāyas <i>Upaniṣhads</i>, i. 74—London; 1896). Ashvatthaḥ = <i>a-shvaḥ-tha</i>, that is, “which stands not till to-morrow.” The idea is that the world-tree (<i>saṁsāravṛikṣha</i>) never lasts till to-morrow, for all things are perpetually changing.</p>
