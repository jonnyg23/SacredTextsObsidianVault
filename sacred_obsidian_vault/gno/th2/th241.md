 <p>1. [V. M.] But, O Asclepius, I see that thou with swift desire of mind art in a hurry to be told how man can have a love and worship of the Heaven, or of the things that are therein. Hear, then, Asclepius!</p>
 <p>The love of God and Heaven, together with all them that are therein, is one perpetual act of worship. <a name="fr_727"></a><a href="#fn_726"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>No other thing ensouled, of Gods or animals, can do this thing, save man alone. <a name="fr_728"></a><a href="#fn_727"><font size="1">2</font></a> Tis in the admiration, adoration, [and] the praise of men, and [in their] acts of worship, that Heaven and Heavens hosts find their delight.</p>
 <p>2. Nor is it without cause the Muses choir hath been sent down by Highest Deity unto the host of men; in order that, forsooth, the terrene world should not seem too uncultured, had it lacked the charm of measures, but rather that with songs and praise of men accompanied with</p>

 <p>music, <a name="fr_729"></a><a href="#fn_728"><font size="1">1</font></a> He might be lauded,—He who alone is all, or is the Sire of all; and so not even on the earths, <a name="fr_730"></a><a href="#fn_729"><font size="1">2</font></a> should there have been an absence of the sweetness of the harmony of heavenly praise.</p>
 <p>3. Some, then, though they be very few, endowed with the Pure Mind, <a name="fr_731"></a><a href="#fn_730"><font size="1">3</font></a> have been entrusted with the sacred charge of contemplating Heaven.</p>
 <p>Whereas those men who, from the two-fold blending of their nature, have not as yet withdrawn their inner reason from their bodys mass, <a name="fr_732"></a><a href="#fn_731"><font size="1">4</font></a> these are appointed for the study of the elements, and [all] that is below them.</p>
 <p>4. Thus mans an animal; yet not indeed less potent in that hes partly mortal, but rather doth he seem to be all the more fit and efficacious for reaching Certain Reason, since he has had mortality bestowed on him as well.</p>
 <p>For it is plain he could not have sustained the strain of both, unless he had been formed out of both natures, <a name="fr_733"></a><a href="#fn_732"><font size="1">5</font></a> so that he could possess the powers of cultivating Earthly things and loving Heaven.</p>

 <p>1. The Reason of a thesis such as this, O [my] Asclepius, I would that thou shouldst grasp, not only with the keen attention of thy soul, but also with its living power <a name="fr_734"></a><a href="#fn_733"><font size="1">1</font></a> [as well].</p>
 <p>For tis a Reason that most men cannot believe; the Perfect and the True are to be grasped by the more holy minds. <a name="fr_735"></a><a href="#fn_734"><font size="1">2</font></a> Hence, then, will I begin.</p>
