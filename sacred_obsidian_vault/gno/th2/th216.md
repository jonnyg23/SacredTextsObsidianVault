 <p></p><h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>
 <p></p><h5 align="center">A PREACHING</h5>
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">There</span> is little to be said about this powerful appeal to cease from the drunkenness of physical sensations and to awaken to the Light.</p>
 <p>Reitzenstein (p. 194) calls it a “<i>Prophetenpredigt</i>” and says that nowhere in the MSS. is it ascribed to Hermes; by which he can only mean that it bears no other superscription than the descriptive sentence which heads it.</p>
 <p>The style and spirit remind us not so much of <i>C. H.</i>, iii. (iv.), as Reitzenstein (p. 206, 1) suggests, as of the interpolated or superadded passages in the “Pœmandres” treatise (§ 27):</p>
 <p>“O ye people, earthborn folk, ye who have given yourselves to drunkenness, and sleep, and ignorance, be sober now, cease from your surfeit, cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep!”</p>
 <p>Did this sentence give rise to our little sermon; or is the sentence a summary of the preaching? Or do both sentence and sermon come from a common stock?</p>
 <p></p><h5 align="center">THE PROBABLE COMPLETION OF AN OXYRHYNCHUS LOGION</h5>
 <p>The last hypothesis seems to be the most satisfactory choice; and we may compare what would appear to be a familiar figure of speech among such communities with <i>logion</i> 3 of the First Oxyrhynchus Fragment:</p>
 <p>“Jesus saith: I stood in the midst of the world (τοῦ κόσμου), and in the flesh did I appear unto them; and I found all men drunken, and none found I athirst among them; and my soul grieveth over the souls of</p>
 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></a></p>
 <p>men, because they are blind in their heart and see not . . .”</p>
 <p>Can we fill up the missing word from our sermon?</p>
 <p>“But sober all they gaze with their hearts eyes on Him who willeth to be seen.”</p>
 <p>The missing word seems, therefore, to be “God.”</p>
 <p>The Gospel that is preached is the Beauty of the Gnosis,—“the Beauty of the Truth and Good that dwells therein”; just as in <i>C. H.</i>, i. 27:</p>
 <p>“And I began to preach to men the Beauty of Devotion and of the Gnosis.”</p>
 <p>The tempest-tossed on the Sea of Ignorance are to make for the Harbour of Salvation—evidently some great organization devoted to the holy life; therein they must seek for one who knows, who can take them by the hand and lead them unto the Gates of the Gnosis.</p>
 <p>This suggests that the organization consisted of a general body, within which were grades of instruction; the many were striving for illumination, some few had reached it.</p>
