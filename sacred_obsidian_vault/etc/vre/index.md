 <dir><i><small>In all sad sincerity I think we must conclude that the attempt to demonstrate by purely intellectual processes the truth of the deliverances of direct religious experience is absolutely hopeless...It would be unfair to philosophy, however, to leave her under this negative sentence. Let me close, then, by briefly enumerating what she can do for religion. If she will abandon metaphysics and deduction for criticism and induction, and frankly transform herself from theology into science of religions, she can make herself enormously useful.--<a href="vre14.htm#page_445">p. 445</a></small></i></dir>

 William James, one of the founders of modern psychology, delivered the
 Gifford lecture in Edinburgh for 1901-2 at a high point in his career. 
 His theme was a systematic analysis of phases of the process of religious
 conversion.
 He examines (mostly Christian) descriptions of conversion phenomena.
 He analyzes psychological phenomena connected with saintliness, and mysticism.
 James believed that science and religion are not incompatible and
 that both could benefit from each other.
