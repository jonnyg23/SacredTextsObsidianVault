 <p>    A CONGREGATION needed Money for repairing the Church, so the Women got together and decided to hold a Raspberry Festival. Sister Frisbie invited them to come and Carouse on her Front Lawn. Some 22 Members of the Flock flew out and bought a few Things to Wear, the Outlay for washable Finery running to about $8 per Head.</p>  
 <p>    Mr. Frisbie got $9 worth of Chinese Lanterns and strung them around. He wanted to do the Thing up Brown so as to get a Puff in the Weekly. The Paper came out and said that the Frisbie Front Yard with its Myriad Twinkling Lights was a Veritable Fairy-Land. That kind of a Notice is worth $9 of anybody's Money.</p>  
 <p>    Mr. Frisbie and three other Pillars of the Church devoted $7 worth of valuable Time to unloading Tables and Camp-Stools.</p>  
 <p>    The Women Folks ruined $14 worth of Complexion working in the hot Kitchen to make Angel Food and Fig Cake.</p>  
 <p>    On the Night of the Raspberry Orgy the Public trampled down $45 worth of Shrubbery.</p>  
 <p>    When it came time to check up the Linen and Silverware it was found that $17 worth of Spoons with Blue Thread tied around them had been lost in the Shuffle.</p>  
 <p>    The Drip from the Candles ruined $29 worth of Summer Suits and Percale Shirt-Waists.</p>  
 <p>Four Children gorged themselves and each was tied in a True Lover's Knot with Cholera Morbus before another Sunrise. The Doctor Bills footed up $18.</p>  
 <p>    After clearing the Wreck, paying the Drayman and settling for the lee Cream and Berries, it was discovered that the Church was $6.80 to the Good. So everybody said it was a Grand Success.</p>  
 <p>MORAL: Anything to avoid dropping it in the Basket.</p>
