 <p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">Scanned and proofed by Eliza Yetter at sacredspiral.com, 2004. Additional formatting at sacred-texts.com by John Bruno Hare, February, 2005. This text is in the public domain in the United States because its copyright was not renewed in a timely fashion (for more information, see below).</font></p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green"><b>NOTE ON COPYRIGHT OF THIS WORK</b><br> Because of the simultaneous publications in London and Boston of this work, it is necessary to take into account the citizenship of the author. We can state with some confidence that Odell Shepard was a US citizen, because he was the Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut from 1940-1943, a post which we surmise would not be open to a non-US citizen. This means that the default rules apply and the copyright is based on US rules, which required a renewal in order to not lapse. The second key fact is that this work was not renewed at the US Copyright Office in 1957-8. This means that this work is currently in the public domain in the United States only because of a defective copyright.</font></p>
