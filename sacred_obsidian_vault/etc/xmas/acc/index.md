 This is a new scan of <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>, Charles Dickens'
 best-loved book, one that continues to be popular today,
 over a century and half later.
 It was created from a photographic facsimile of an early printing
 of the first edition of 1843, published by K.S. Giniger Company in 1956.
 Thus the text may diverge slightly from modern editions.
 Edgar Johnson noted in the introduction to the facsimile edition that
 "It is not the <i>very</i> earliest state, but the form of
 the first edition that Dickens himself preferred."
 There are a few quirks in this edition:
 e.g. the title of the first chapter is 'Stave I,' but
 successive chapter numbers are spelled out.
 </p>
 <p>
 Dickens' tale of greed and redemption is a heart-warming
 tale of a Christmas miracle.
 But there is a dead serious purpose here.
 Dickens takes the mantle of an Old Testament prophet,
 issuing a stern warning to the capitalist class
 that they needed to mend their ways,
 or things would get a lot worse.
 It is also documentation of a now-lost world.
 Dickens shows us a panorama of 19th century English society, both high and low:
 bustling street scenes, a dingy rag-and-bones shop,
 a high-spirited Christmas dance.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ironically, in spite of the message against greed, <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>
 was actually written by Dickens during a sales slump, solely to make money.
 He penned the short pot-boiler in a whirlwind six weeks,
 so that he could get it on the shelves before Christmas.
 It went on sale on the 19th of December, 1843, and far exceeded expectations.
 The book went through six printings before Christmas day, 1843.
 Reviewers also loved it.
 The critic Francis Jeffrey said: "You have done more good...by this
 little publication...than can be traced to all the pulpits and confessionals
 in Christendom since Christmas 1842."
 Thackeray said "It seems to me...a national benefit, and to every
 man or woman who reads it a personal kindness."
 It continues to be a beloved classic, as much a part of the holiday
 season as Christmas trees, Nativity displays, and Santa Claus.
 </p>
 <p>
 <i>Technical note</i>: Contractions throughout were printed as a separate
 word in the original text (I 'll, we 're, etc.),
 as was the practice at the time,
 but they have been merged with the preceding word in this etext to facilitate
 searching.
