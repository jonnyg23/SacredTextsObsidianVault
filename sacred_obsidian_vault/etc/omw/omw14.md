   <h3 align="center">JAPANESE</h3>  
 <p>In distinction to Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, Shintoism is the primitive body of beliefs of the Japanese people. The two cosmological myths given here are from Shinto sources. The triumph of the Sun Goddess over darkness and disorder is identified with the triumph of the Imperial dynasty over forces that were hostile to it: the Imperial family claim descent from the Sun Goddess.</p>
