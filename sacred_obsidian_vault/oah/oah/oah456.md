 <p>1. WHERE are Thy singers, Jehovih? Who have beholden the vastness of the Creator! And the times and the splendor of Thy universe.</p>
 <p>2. And the adoration that slumbereth but for a season, and then bursteth like a world on fire! Whom Thou appointest from time to time to sing of Thee.</p>
 <p>3. Sing unto the Almighty. He spandeth the times of millions of years as if but a day, in the fashion and splendor of His works.</p>
 <p>4. He openeth His heavens as a book is opened. The prophet of the Creator readeth of the magnitude of the works of Jehovih!</p>
