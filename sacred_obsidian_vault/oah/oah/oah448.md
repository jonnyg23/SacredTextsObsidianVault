 <p>1. SING unto Him, O ye mountains; and send unto Him the sound of rippling waters, O ye valleys!</p>
 <p>2. And all ye singing winds of heaven! Ye whistling wind, on the high mountains, and thou whispering breeze on the plain!</p>
 <p>3. Praise Him, thou lightning, and thou peal of thunder! Rend ye the air of heaven in Jehovih's praise!</p>
 <p>4. Sing to Him, thou surging river, and thou moaning sea of waters! He playeth as on the harp, with the dumb elements.</p>
 <p>5. His strains are mighty! His tunes are the hum and whir of falling waters. Sing to Jehovih, O ye great water-falls!</p>
 <p>6. Chant ye everlastingly, and write His name in the bow that perisheth not, forever.</p>
 <p>7. He that tuneth the forests to sing in the clouds; that stringeth His instrument with hemlock and pine and cedar.</p>
 <p>8. Who maketh the forests beat time to His strains. Praise ye Jehovih, forever and ever.</p>
