 <p>1. THE Almighty calleth from the boundaries of the firmament down to the sands of the earth in glory of His creations. <a name="page_655"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 655</font></a></p>
 <p>2. Proclaim His name with the hands of those that knew not speech. Give them the sign of the Rising Sun, the High Noon and the Shades of Evening.</p>
 <p>3. The Almighty, Whose breath bloweth millions of worlds in the circuit of the universe! Whose pulse is the flight of countless suns and stars!</p>
 <p>4. Praise ye the Almighty, Whose triumph encircleth the world. Let the races of man proclaim Him forever.</p>
