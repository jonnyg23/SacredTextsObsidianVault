 <h1 align="CENTER">Second Book of Lords</h1>
 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">OF THE SECOND CYCLE, BEING COTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE BOOK OF AH'SHONG, SON OF JEHOVIH.</p>
 </font><h3 align="CENTER">Chapter I</h3>
 <p>1. IN the beginning man was naked and not ashamed; but the Lord raised man up and bade him hide his nakedness, and man obeyed, and was clothed.</p>
 <p>2. And the Lord walked by man for a long season, showing him the way of resurrection; and man was obedient, depending on the Lord for all things.</p>
 <p>3. And the Lord said unto man: Behold, I have walked with thee, and taught thee; but by my indulgence thou hast neglected to put forth thine own energy.</p>
 <p>4. Now I am going away from thee for a season, that thou mayst learn to develop thyself.</p>
 <p>5. But lest thou stumble and fall, I leave with thee certain commandments, and they shall be a guide unto thee and thy heirs forever.</p>
 <p>6. Hear thou then the commandments of the Lord thy God.</p>
 <p>7. Thou shalt love thy Creator with all thy mind, and heart, and soul, all the days of thy life.</p>
 <p>8. And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
 <p>9. Because thou wert born into the world without covering, thou shalt clothe thyself.</p>
 <p>10. Then inquired man of the Lord: Behold, thou hast shown the ass what is good for him to eat, and the fish, and the serpent, and the lion; every living creature; but man only hast thou not shown?</p>
 <p>11. The Lord said: Of everything that groweth up out of the ground that is good to eat give I unto thee, and they shall be food for thee.</p>
 <p>12. But of all things of flesh and blood, wherein is life, thou shalt not eat.</p>
 <p>13. For thou shalt not kill.</p>
 <p>14. Man inquired of the Lord: Thou has shown the males and females of all the living the times and periods to come together; but man and woman hast thou not shown?</p>
 <p>15. The Lord said: Thou shalt learn from the beasts, and birds, and fishes, that the female during gestation is in keeping of her Creator.</p>
 <p>16. Thou shalt also respect the times of woman.</p>
 <p>17. Man inquired of the Lord: Thou hast shown the bird how to build her nest, and the carnivore how to scent the subtle track of his prey, and the spider to weave his net; but as to the manner of man's house, or as to herbs that are good or are poisonous, thou has not shown man.</p>
 <p>18. The Lord said: All the instinct that is in the bird, or beast, or fish, or insect, or creeping thing, was created with them, but man was created blank; and yet man shall attain to more subtle senses than any other living creature.</p>
 <p>19. Man inquired: How shall man attain to these?</p>
 <p>20. The Lord answered: Serve thy Creator by doing good unto others with all thy wisdom and strength, and by being true to thine own highest light, and all knowledge shall come to thee.</p>
 <p>21. So the Lord left man for a season to himself; and man so loved the earth and whatsoever ministered unto his ease, and to his flesh desires, that he fell from his high estate. And great darkness came upon the earth. And man cast aside his clothes, and went naked, and became carnal in his desires.</p>
