 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter II</h3>
 <p>1. GOD said: Hear me, O man. I am come to teach thee wise dominion.</p>
 <p>2. Man said: The aborigines were free. Why shall man with more wisdom learn dominion?</p>
 <p>3. Seffas said: My peace is forced peace; I am the light and the life.</p>
 <p>4. Man inquired: Behold, the air of heaven is free. Can dominion come down out of nothing (as it seemeth) and rule over something (that is proven)?</p>
 <p>5. How can God rule over solid flesh?</p>
 <p>6. Uz said: O vain man! Do I not come in the winds of heaven and cast cities in epidemic? And yet man seeth me not.</p>
 <p>7. I inoculate in the breath; I cast fevers in the bright sunlight, and yet no man seeth me.</p>

 <p>8. Jehovih said: All power gave I to the unseen to rule over the seen.</p>
 <p>9. Kosmon said: Why wilt thou, O man, search forever in corpor for the cause of things? Behold, the unseen part of thyself ruleth over the seen.</p>
 <p>10. God said: Think not that the es worlds are less governed by system than are the corporeal worlds. The same Creator created all.</p>

 <p>11. Behold, all things are in dominion. Thou wert in dark dominion before the time of Bon.</p>
 <p>12. By mine own light gave I thee a dominion of light in the time of Bon.</p>
 <p>13. Man inquired: If the unseen rule in man, what ruled the substance of man before he was made?</p>
 <p>14. Jehovih said: I created all things, seen and unseen. My hand was forever stretched forth in work. I make and I dissipate everlastingly.</p>
 <p>15. Behold, I make a in etherea, hundreds and hundreds of millions of miles across, and it driveth to the centre a corporeal world from that which was unseen.</p>
 <p>16. I blow my breath upon the planet, and lo, man cometh forth, inquiring: Who am I, and what is my destiny?</p>
 <p>17. I send an elder brother of man, to teach him, and show him the light.</p>
 <p>18. God said: Behold me, O man, I am an elder brother. I have passed through death and found the glory of the unseen worlds.</p>

 <p>19. Jehovih gave to me, thy God, to have dominion over the earth and her heavens.</p>
 <p>20. Man said: I have found truth in corpor; I know that I live; that trees grow and die.</p>
 <p>21. This is true knowledge. Give me truth in regard to the unseen, that I may prove it truth.</p>
 <p>22. Why, O God, givest thou the matters of heaven and earth in signs and symbols? Give me the real light, I want no figures.</p>
 <p>23. God said: Thou art vain, O man. What, then, hast thou learnt? Canst thou tell why the grass is green, or why one rose is red and another white, or the mountains raised up, or the valleys sunken low? Or why a man was not made to fly as a bird, or live in the water like a fish? Whence came the thought of shame? Even thyself thou dost not comprehend, nor know of thine own knowledge the time of thy beginning. Thou knowest three times three are nine; and even this thou canst not prove but by symbols and images.</p>
 <p>24. Nor is there aught in thy corporeal knowledge that thou canst prove otherwise, save it be thy presence; and even that that thou seest is not thy presence, but the symbol and image of it, for thou thyself art but as a seed, a spark of the All Light, that thou canst not prove to exist.</p>
 <p>25. Man inquired: Where, then, is real knowledge possible to man? If my corporeal body and corporeal senses are evanescent and soon to fly away, how can I comprehend that which flieth not away, the spirit?</p>

 <p>26. Yet I know a truth: I know that ten things are ten. This knowledge I can write down, and clearly teach to my brother. See, here are 10. This is exact science.</p>
 <p>27. Esfoma said: Thou hast written but two strokes, and called them ten. Now, I will show thee ten. (Esfoma wrote: | | | | | | | | | | .) Yet, be not surprised, for now I will convict myself, also, inasmuch as I have deceived thee. I said I would show thee ten, and straightway, I made ten marks; but I should have written the word ten. Now, thou art wise! Nay, hear me further, for all I have spoken is false; for have I not tried to persuade thee that the one uttered word, TEN, was ten; wherefore, I should have uttered ten utterences. Thy supposed exact science is nothing, and thy supposed truth is only falsehood compounded and acquiesced in.</p>
 <p>28. Jehovih said: Man's wisdom is but the experience of my creations, expressed to man's understanding in signs and symbols.</p>
 <p>29. Man said: If I search for the real, shall I never attain it? Why, then, this craving? Is truth only that which flieth away?</p>
 <p>30. Behold, thou hast said: Thou shalt love the Creator with all thy heart and soul! How can I love that which I can not comprehend?</p>
 <p>31. Es said: Behold the utterances of the birds; and the skipping of the lambs at play! These are the expressed love they have for the Creator.</p>
 <p>32. To rejoice because thou art created; to seek after exalted rejoicing, to cultivate the light of thy life; to turn away from dark things; these are to love thy Creator.</p>
 <p>33. Man said: Why, then, if truth can not be found, and mathematics can not be proven but by things that are false in fact, I will search for goodness; I will shun sin. Is this not wise?</p>
 <p>34. God said: This is wise. But what are goodness and good works?</p>
