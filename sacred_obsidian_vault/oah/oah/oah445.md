 <p>1. O Thou, Jehovih, give me words rich in Thy praise; my soul is like a fountain springing up out of the earth.</p>
 <p>2. I would look upon Thee; into Thy face, O my Creator, who taketh away my breath by the awe of Thy countenance.</p>
 <p>3. Thou, who fashioned the broad earth and the high heavens! O, the works of Thy hand, Jehovih!</p>
 <p>4. Where shall I start with my song unto Thee; or find words to laud the Almighty?</p>
 <p>5. Proclaim His Unity, O my beloved; proclaim Him, in one breath, together, O all ye people. Jehovih! Jehovih!</p>
 <p>6. O that I could magnify words to <a name="page_653"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 653</font></a>Thy Omnipotence, or hold up the perfection of Thy Person in fine speech!</p>
 <p>7. But I am as one distracted by the over-whelming scene. My words cripple and halt continually before Thy surprising creations.</p>
 <p>8. O that I could find a starting point; or knew a way to make rhymes and meters without rules, like the works of Jehovih!</p>
