 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">HOLY VEIL DAY</p></font>.
 <p>1. AS Jehovih, through His God, pulled aside the veil of heaven, saying:</p>
 <p>2. Let My angels forth; together shall converse the living and the dead.</p>
 <p>3. So santified He the day when the angels of heaven were made known to mortals. (March 31, 1848.)</p>
 <p>4. And He gave the sign, A HAND HOLDING ASIDE A VEIL, signifying, HEAVEN UNVEILED, as the master's sign in the lodge on the day and evening commemorating the same.</p>
 <p>5. And Jehovih gave to the members of the lodge to answer in the sign, THREE CLAPPINGS, signifying, ENDLESS JOY!</p>
 <p>6. And Jehovih said: Remember this day, and keep it holy, to the end of the world. For, without books and without arguments, behold, I have proven unto you the immortality of the soul of man!</p>
