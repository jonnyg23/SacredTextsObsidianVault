 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter VI</h3>
 <p>1. GOD said: I declare in the name of Jehovih, the Whole. Through Him, and by His hand have I been lifted up. hear me, O mortals! Give ear, O ye spirits of the dead! The Father hath spoken; Him do I reval; in Him bestow the tree of light.</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>2. I was in darkness, but am now in light. His presence is upon me. Hearken, then, to my words, and be wise in your lives.</p>
 <p>3. Seek not to disprove Him; seek not to prove that these things can not be; seek not to deny His person, nor <a name="page_552"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 552</font></a> His spirit. Of such was my bondage. In bitterness of heart was I bound in darkness. Those who deny, those who try to disprove Him, are in darkness.</p>
 <p>4. He is the same to-day and forever. The prophets of old found Him; so also can ye. But He cometh not to the denier, nor to the disprover.</p>

 <p>5. He who will find His Person must look for Him. He who will hear His Voice must hearken. Then cometh light.</p>
 <p>6. All argument is void. There is more wisdom in the song of a bird than in the speech of a philosopher. The first speaketh to the Almighty, proclaiming his glory. The second ploddeth in darkness.</p>
 <p>7. By my hand were the ancient libraries burnt, to draw man away from darkness.</p>
 <p>8. Kosmon said: What hath great learning found that is valuable?</p>
 <p>9. Shall learning, like riches, be acquired for one's own selfish gratification?</p>
 <p>10. If a rich man with his horded wealth do little for the resurrection of man, how much less doth the learned man with a head full of knowledge? It neither feedeth nor clotheth the sick and distressed, nor stayeth the debauchery and drunkenness of the great multitude.</p>
 <p>11. How shall we class the man of exact science? Where shall we find him? How shall we know that he will not be disproved in time to come?</p>
 <p>12. Yesterday it was said, a man can not fast forty days and live; to-day it is proven possible.</p>
 <p>13. Yesterday it was said, there is attraction of gravitation betwixt the sun and the earth; to-day it is proven that there is no such thing. That no man can see without eyes or hear without ears, in su'is (clairvoyance and clairaudience); to-day hundreds of thousands know it to be so.</p>
 <p>14. Yesterday it was said, thou shalt eat flesh and oil, because they supply certain things for the blood, without which man can not live; to-day it is proven otherwise.</p>
 <p>15. Yesterday the physician said: Take thou this, and it will heal thee; to-day the same thing is proven to have no virtue.</p>
 <p>16. This only is proven: That man is vain and conceited, desiring to make others believe he is wise when he is not.</p>
 <p>17. What healed the sick yesterday, will not to-morrow.</p>
 <p>18. Philosophy that was good yesterday, is folly to-day.</p>
 <p>19. Religions that were good for the ancients are worthless to-day.</p>
 <p>20. Crime and pauperism grow up in the heart of them, even worse than in the regions of the earth where they are not preached.</p>
 <p>21. The physicians have not lessened the amount of sickness on the earth.</p>
 <p>22. The lawyers have not lessened the rascality of the wicked, or depleted the number of defrauders.</p>
 <p><a name="page_553"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 553</font></a></p>
 <p>23. The march of Jehovih and His peoples is onward; it is like a tree of light, forever growing, but man heedeth not the growth.</p>
 <p>24. Man bindeth his judgment by things that are past; he will not quicken himself to see and understand the All Light.</p>
