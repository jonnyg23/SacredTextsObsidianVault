 <h3 align="CENTER">YAD.</h3>
 <p>1. PRAISE be unto Thee, Jehovih! Who can search out the completeness of Thy creation?</p>
 <p>2. Or know the magnitude of Thy places, Thou Almighty! And thy endless inventions?</p>
 <p>3. Thou shalt be My theme forever, to find the far-seeing devices of my Creator, the work of my soul.</p>
 <p>4. I was alone in the world. Angels and men fed not my soul; I was hungered and in gloom.</p>
 <p>5. Then I turned to Thee, Thou Almighty. And Thou gavest me a new growth, a fruit of life in fire!</p>
 <p>6. Which grew brighter and brighter. And my vision was recovered, and Thy heavens were opened as a book is opened.</p>
 <p>7. And I drank of Thy waters, and ate of the tree of the resurrection to Thy everlasting kingdoms.</p>
 <p>8. The secret of Thy Wisdom, O Jehovih, was uncovered; the way of Thy Mightiness made imperishable forever!</p>
