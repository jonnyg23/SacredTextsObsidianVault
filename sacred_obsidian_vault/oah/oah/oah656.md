 <font size="2"><p align="CENTER">GOD DISCOURSETH ON LOVE</p></font>.
 <p>1. MANY will come to thee, inquiring: How sayest thou of such as are married, having children of their own? Shall they so love the fraternity and the kingdom of Jehovih that they shall set aside their filial love, assigning their children wholly to the teachers, day and night?</p>
 <p>2. Thou shalt answer them: Nay, in all the fullness of their love, let them manifest unto their little ones. And let this be a testimony unto those who have children, how hard it is for foundlings and orphan babes that have none to love or caress them, that such parents may add unto their household others also, showing no partiality. And this is the highest of all mortal attributes--to be impartial in love.</p>
 <p>3. Not to abridge love but to extend it, God-like, embracing all people, so shall the members of the brotherhood labor with thy God and his holy angels, for the glory of Jehovih.</p>
