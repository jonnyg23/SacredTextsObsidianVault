 </h4><p>Male Continence is a pamphlet by John Humphrey Noyes, a graduate of Yale Divinity School. It was published in 1872. Ignorant of sexual tantra (no translations were available in the West in his day), Noyes independently discovered the possibility and benefits of making love without ejaculation. In this pamphlet he eloquently defends his discovery.</p>
