 <p>This short book on ancient 'Phallic worship', as the
 Victorians called it, contains much which is covered in
 the other entries in this literature.
 Jennings has a compelling thesis about the role of sexuality
 in ancient religions and their modern successors which
 bears careful examination.
 There is also a lot of speculation, incorrect information, 
 conclusion-leaping and questionable etymology.</p>
 
 <p>
 Jennings places an inordinate amount of signficance
 on anything that is vaguely phallic looking or resembles a vagina.
 This includes pawn shop signage, tortise heads,
 arched doors, lozange-shaped design elements, and so on.
 While some of this is revealing and possibly valid,
 he finishes off by pegging a fairly
 standard native Californian mortar and pestle as
 a set of ritual phallic symbols.
 There are examples <i>ad nauseum</i> of these items
 in the anthropologicial and archeological literature of California,
 and none of them have ever been associated
 with sex-worship to my knowledge.
 Sometimes a pestle is just a pestle....

 Hargrave Jennings also wrote <a href="../../sro/rrm/index.htm">The Rosicrucians,
 their Rites and Mysteries</a>, also available online at sacred-texts,
 where he goes into much more detail on the subject of phallic worship.
