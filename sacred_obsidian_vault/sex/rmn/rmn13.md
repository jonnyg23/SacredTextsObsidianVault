 PLATE XII</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>
 <h1 align="CENTER">Drillopota.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">TERRA COTTA. <i>Height, 16 5/25 inches</i>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE XII.</p>
 <p>BEHIND this figure is seen a vessel, which represents one of those obscene vases called <i>Drillopotæ</i>, <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">1</font></a> out of which the ancients were wont to drink on certain occasions, undoubtedly in honour of Venus, or perhaps of Bacchus; for, assuredly it would be difficult to suppose anything like dignity or seriousness in such ceremonies. For a long time the corruption of the antique nations led them to feign a disgraceful attachment for the immodest ceremonies to which they were no longer able to yield a sincere worship.</p>
 <p>This dwarf holds two objects in his hand which it would be difficult to qualify--two lumps of bread, perhaps. He carries in his belt a sort of casket, which may be the <i>crepundia</i>, a small box or purse for children to keep their toys in.</p>
 <p>This <i>Drillopota</i> comes from Civita.</p>
