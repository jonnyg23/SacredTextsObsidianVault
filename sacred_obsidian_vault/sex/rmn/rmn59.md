 <h1 align="CENTER">Bell-shaped Vase.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE LVIII.</p>
 <p>THIS vase is of the kind which the Neapolitans call <i>campana</i>, on account of their shape, which has some resemblance to a bell.</p>
 <p>On one side is represented a scene of the Dionysia or Bacchanalia. Three men are taking part in them, each furnished with preposterous phalluses. One of these personages is seated, and represents old Silenus: this is the hierophant, the president of the festival. To the spectator's right is a Bacchus covered with the chlamys, and with his head in a hairy casque. Between these two divinities may be seen a little old man, who draws near the hierophant, places one hand on his thigh, and prepares to worship the attributes of the god.</p>
 <p>The other side represents a Bacchic game. A young woman is stooping to pick up the sphæra (a kind of ball) which she has dropped, but her awkwardness is equivalent to a defeat, and her adversary approaches her to exercise the rights of victory.</p>
 <p>These two subjects are intermingled with foliage and with arabesques.</p>
