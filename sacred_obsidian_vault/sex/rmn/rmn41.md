 <h1 align="CENTER">An Hermaphrodite.</h1>
 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Height, 49½ inches. Width 32 10/25 inches.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE XL.</p>
 <p>THIS figure represents an hermaphrodite full of grace, youth, and beauty. We have given some particulars respecting these fabulous beings in the Introduction to this work; and we have also explained why the leaf of the water-lily was consecrated to them.</p>
 <p>The hermaphrodite here represented gracefully raises the mantle in which he is enveloped, and reveals at one and the same time the organ of virility and a woman's breast.</p>
 <p>An attentive examination of this painting will show that such a being could not exist. The beauty which glows in every one of his limbs; the softness revealed by the rounded forms; everything, in this figure, betrays a sensible and passive being, created for resistance and defeat; there is nothing there, on the other hand, to indicate the vigour and boldness of character which is the birthright of the sex made to attack and to conquer.</p>
 <p>This fresco was among the excavations of Pompeii.</p>
