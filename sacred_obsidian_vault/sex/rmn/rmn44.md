 Plate XLIII.</p>
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86</font></a></p>
 <h1 align="CENTER">A Faun and Bacchante</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">FRESCO FROM POMPEII.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE XLIII.</p>
 <p>A FAUN is engaged in contest with a nymph. The originality of the poses is not less remarkable than the purity of the drawing.</p>
 <p>An amorous encounter has sprung up between the god and the nymph: the former slips and falls, but it does not appear his fair companion desires seriously to take advantage of this accident in order to escape the fate which awaits her. It Is evident that she defends herself feebly: her features, her inflamed look, her nakedness, all betray that she is willing to be vanquished. She knows that her own defeat will furnish her with new arms to subjugate and enchain the happy conqueror in his turn.</p>
 <p>In the background of this fresco is a very simple landscape, not well preserved.</p>
