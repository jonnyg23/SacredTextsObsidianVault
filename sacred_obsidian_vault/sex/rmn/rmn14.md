 PLATE XIII</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>
 <h1 align="CENTER">Drillopota.</h1>
 <p align="CENTER">TERRA COTTA. <i>Height, 16 16/25 inches</i>.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">PLATE XIII.</p>
 <p>LIKE the former, this is another specimen of the <i>drillopotæ</i>, representing a dwarf, a child's body with the head of an old man. Its figure is as much out of proportion as its attitude is obscene and yet its gestures seem too indicate modesty.</p>
 <p>Sometimes the ancients made use of certain <i>drillopotæ</i>, made of glass these were called <i>phallovitroboli</i>, or <i>phalloveretroboli</i>, drinking-glasses in the form of phalluses. <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">1</font></a> Juvenal says: "He drinks from a Priapeian glass;" <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">2</font></a> and the commentator adds: "Glass <a href="errata.htm#2">phalluses</a> called <i>drillopotæ</i>."</p>
 <p>The present vase is seen full and side-face; it will be remarked that the upper part has no opening, whence it appears that the vessel was turned upside down and filled at the bottom; it is probable that they drank from he projecting part as from a spout. <i>O tempora</i>!!</p>
 <p>Many other <i>drillopotæ</i> have been found at Civita, Herculaneum, and several parts of Magna Grecia; but as they are not in any way different from those we have described, we have deemed it useless to repeat a description of them.</p>
