 <h2 align="center">DOES THE WOMAN NEED THE ORGASM?</h2>
 
 <p>A lady physician of my acquaintance thinks that a woman would be left congested in her sexual organs, probably, by Karezza, did she not have the orgasm, and the result would finally be disease.</p><p>
 
 I have not found it so in practice, and the criticism would almost appear to have come from one who had not known Karezza in its perfect form. If valid, it would apply to the man as well and would destroy all force of the case for Karezza for either sex, which is far from what my critic desires.</p><p>
 
 In Dr. Max Huner's <em>Disorders of the Sexual System</em>, a work in which the woman's need of the orgasm is strongly insisted on, I find these significant words: "'Whenever a woman states that she remains dry after coitus it generally means a lack of orgasm." In other words, it is very common in the ordinary orgasmal embrace, for the man to have an orgasm in a few moments and depart, leaving the woman entirely unsatisfied in every way. The ordinary husband-and-wife embrace, anyway, is purely sexual, and based on his demand to get rid of a surplus. There is little or no thought to make it esthetic or affectional - it is merely animal. If the husband stays long enough and excites his wife sufficiently to have an orgasm, then she has a gushing out of fluids that relieves the congestion brought on by his approaches, and on the physical plane, at least, she is relieved and satisfied, the same as he. If not, "she remains dry." Her moisture or dryness, then, are a pretty good index of her physical satisfaction and relief of congestion, or the reverse.</p><p>
 
 But what happens in Karezza? Here, if she really loves her partner, her whole nature is attuned to his, in delicious docility, expectation and rapport. Every nerve vibrates in sweet gratitude and response to his touch. There is a marvelously sweet blending and reconciliation of the voluptuous and the spiritual that satisfies both her body and her soul at once and makes her exquisitely sensitive to everything poetic or esthetic in his acts. In this state, when interrelation

 has been successfully established and his magnetism is flowing through her every fiber, uniting them as one, such a heavenly ecstasy of peace, love and happiness possesses her that she "melts" (there is no other word for it), her whole being wishes to join with his, and though there is no orgasm in the ordinary definition of the word yet her fluids gush out in an exactly similar manner and all possible congestion is utterly and completely relieved. Not only is this true of the mucus membranes, but the outer skin also is bathed in a sweet sweat. Indeed I consider mutual perspiration as very desirable, if not almost indispensable to the most perfect magnetation, as the moist bodies in loving contact seem to communicate the magnetic, electric currents so much more effectually then.</p><p>
 
 Rest assured that no woman who has known Karezza in its ideal, its "Heaven" and "Peace" form, remains dry, nor is she left with any trace of congestion, or restlessness. On the contrary, she often sinks into a blissful slumber in the very midst of the embrace, just after its sweetest delights.</p><p>
 
 In truth I have often thought that a very plausible argument might be advanced for the claim that in Karezza the woman really did have an orgasm, only in such a very gradual form, spread over so long a time, and so sweetly sublimated and exalted in love, that the usual symptoms did not appear or were unrecognized as such.</p>
