 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana</i>, tr. by Richard Burton, [1883], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h2 align="CENTER">CHAPTER IV</h2> <h3 align="CENTER">THE LIFE OF A CITIZEN</h3> 
 <p>HAVING thus acquired learning, a man, with the wealth that he may have gained by gift, conquest, purchase, deposit, <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="kama101.htm#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> or inheritance from his ancestors, should become a householder, and pass the life of a citizen. <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="kama101.htm#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a> He should take a house in a city, or large village, or in the vicinity of good men, or in a place which is the resort of many persons. This abode should be situated near some water, and divided into different compartments for different purposes. It should be surrounded by a garden, and also contain two rooms, an outer and an inner one. The inner room should be occupied by the females, while the outer room, balmy with rich perfumes, should contain a bed, soft, agreeable to the sight, covered with a clean white cloth, low in the middle part, having garlands and bunches of flowers <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="kama101.htm#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a> upon it, and a canopy above it, and two pillows, one at the top, another at the bottom. There should be also a sort of couch besides, and at the head of this a sort of stool, on which should be placed the fragrant ointments for the night, as well as flowers, pots containing collyrium and other fragrant substances, things used for perfuming the mouth, and the bark of the common citron tree. Near the couch, on the ground, there should be a pot for spitting, a box containing ornaments, and also a lute hanging from a peg made of the tooth of an elephant, a board for drawing, a pot containing perfume, some books, and some garlands of the yellow amaranth flowers. Not far from the couch, and on the ground, there should be a round seat, a toy cart, and a board for playing with dice; outside the outer room there should be cages of birds, <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="kama102.htm#fn_6"><font size="1">4</font></a> and a separate place for spinning, carving and such like diversions. In the garden there should be a whirling swing and a common swing, as also a bower of creepers covered with flowers, in which a raised parterre should be made for sitting.</p> 
 <p>Now the householder, having got up in the morning and performed his necessary duties, <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">5</font></a> should wash his teeth, apply a limited quantity of ointments and perfumes to his body, put some ornaments on his person and collyrium on his eyelids and below his eyes, colour his lips with alacktaka, <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">6</font></a> and look at himself in the glass. Having then eaten betel leaves, with other things that give fragrance to the mouth, he should perform his usual business. He should bathe daily, anoint his body with oil every other day, apply a lathering substance <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">7</font></a> to his body every three days, get his head (including face) shaved every four days and the other parts of his body every five or ten days. <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">8</font></a> All these things should be done without fail, and the sweat of the armpits should also be removed. Meals should be taken in the forenoon, in the afternoon, and again at night, according to Charayana. After breakfast, parrots and other birds should be taught to speak, and the fighting of cocks, quails, and rams should follow. A limited time should be devoted to diversions with Pithamardas, Vitas, and Vidushakas, <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">9</font></a> and then should be taken the midday sleep. <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">10</font></a> After this the householder, having put on his clothes and ornaments, should, during the afternoon, converse with his friends. In the evening there should be singing, and after that the householder, along with his friend, should await in his room, previously decorated and perfumed, the arrival of the woman that may be attached to him, or he may send a female messenger for her, or go for her himself. After her arrival at his house, he and his friend should welcome her, and entertain her with a loving and agreeable conversation. Thus end the duties of the day.</p> 
 <p>The following are the things to be done occasionally as diversions or amusements:</p>  <ul> <li>Holding festivals <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">11</font></a> in honour of different Deities  </li><li>Social gatherings of both sexes  </li><li>Drinking parties  </li><li>Picnics  </li><li>Other social diversions</li></ul>  <h4 align="CENTER">Festivals</h4> 
 <p>On some particular auspicious day, an assembly of citizens should be convened in the temple of Saraswati. <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">12</font></a> There the skill of singers, and of others who may have come recently to the town, should be tested, and on the following day they should always be given some rewards. After that they may either be retained or dismissed, according as their performances are liked or not by the assembly. The members of the assembly should act in concert, both in times of distress as well as in times of prosperity, and it is also the duty of these citizens to show hospitality to strangers who may have come to the assembly. What is said above should be understood to apply to all the other festivals which may be held in honour of the different Deities, according to the present rules.</p> 
 <p> </p> <h4 align="CENTER">Social Gatherings</h4> 
 <p>When men of the same age, disposition and talents, fond of the same diversions and with the same degree of education, sit together in company with public women, <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">13</font></a> or in an assembly of citizens, or at the abode of one among themselves, and engage in agreeable discourse with each other, such is called a Sitting in company or a social gathering. The subjects of discourse are to be the completion of verses half composed by others, and the testing the knowledge of one another in the various arts. The women who may be the most beautiful, who may like the same things that the men like, and who may have power to attract the minds of others, are here done homage to.</p> 
 <p> </p> <h4 align="CENTER">Drinking Parties</h4> 
 <p>Men and women should drink in one another's houses. And here the men should cause the public women to drink, and should then drink themselves, liquors such as the Madhu, Aireya, Sara and Asawa, which are of bitter and sour taste; also drinks concocted from the barks of various trees, wild fruits and leaves.</p> 
 <p> </p> <h4 align="CENTER">Going to Gardens or Picnics</h4> 
 <p>In the forenoon, men having dressed themselves should go to gardens on horseback, accompanied by public women and followed by servants. And having done there all the duties of the day, and passed the time in various agreeable diversions, such as the fighting of quails, cocks and rams, and other spectacles, they should return home in the afternoon in the same manner, bringing with them bunches of flowers, etc.</p> 
 <p>The same also applies to bathing in summer in water from which wicked or dangerous animals have previously been taken out, and which has been built in on all sides.</p> <h4 align="CENTER">Other Social Diversions</h4> 
 <p>Spending nights playing with dice. Going out on moonlight nights. Keeping the festive day in honour of spring. Plucking the sprouts and fruits of the mango trees. Eating the fibres of lotuses. Eating the tender ears of corn. Picnicing in the forests when the trees get their new foliage. The Udakakashvedika or sporting in the water. Decorating each other with the flowers of some trees. Pelting each other with the flowers of the Kadamba tree, and many other sports which may either be known to the whole country, or may be peculiar to particular parts of it. These and similar other amusements should always be carried on by citizens.</p> 
 <p>The above amusements should be followed by a person who diverts himself alone in company with a courtesan, as well as by a courtesan who can do the same in company with her maid servants or with citizens.</p> 
 <p>A Pithamarda <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">14</font></a> is a man without wealth, alone in the world, whose only property consists of his Mallika, <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">15</font></a> some lathering substance and a red cloth, who comes from a good country, and who is skilled in all the arts; and by teaching these arts is received in the company of citizens, and in the abode of public women.</p> 
 <p>A Vita <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">16</font></a> is a man who has enjoyed the pleasures of fortune, who is a compatriot of the citizens with whom he associates, who is possessed of the qualities of a houseliolder, who has his wife with him, and who is honoured in the assembly of citizens and in the abodes of public women, and lives on their means and on them. A Vidushaka <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">17</font></a> (also called a Vaihasaka, i.e. one who provokes laughter) is a person only acquainted with some of the arts, who is a jester, and who is trusted by all.</p> 
 <p>These persons are employed in matters of quarrels and reconciliations between citizens and public women.</p> 
 <p>This remark applies also to female beggars, to women with their heads shaved, to adulterous women, and to public women skilled in all the various arts.</p> 
 <p>Thus a citizen living in his town or village, respected by all, should call on the persons of his own caste who may be worth knowing. He should converse in company and gratify his friends by his society, and obliging others by his assistance in various matters, he should cause them to assist one another in the same way.</p> 
 <p>There are some verses on this subject as follows:</p> 
 <p>'A citizen discoursing, not entirely in the Sanscrit language, <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">18</font></a> nor wholly in the dialects of the country, on various topics in society, obtains great respect. The wise should not resort to a society disliked by the public, governed by no rules, and intent on the destruction of others. But a learned man living in a society which acts according to the wishes of the people, and which has pleasure for its only object is highly respected in this world.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_19"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_19">11</a> These are very common in all parts of India.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_20"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_20">12</a> In the 'Asiatic Miscellany', and in Sir W. Jones's works, will be found a spirited hymn addressed to this goddess, who is adored as the patroness of the fine arts, especially of music and rhetoric, as the inventress of the Sanscrit language, etc. etc. She is the goddess of harmony, eloquence and language, and is somewhat analogous to Minerva. For farther information about her, see Edward Moor's Hindoo Pantheon.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_21"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_21">13</a> The public women, or courtesans (Vesya), of the early Hindoos have often been compared with the Hetera of the Greeks. The subject is dealt with at some length in H. H. Wilson's Select Specimens of the Theatre of the Hindoos, in two volumes, Trubner and Co., 1871. It may be fairly considered that the courtesan was one of the elements, and an important element too, of early Hindoo society, and that her education and intellect were both superior to that of the women of the household. Wilson says, 'By the Vesya or courtesan, however, we are not to understand a female who has disregarded the obligation of law or the precepts of virtue, but a character reared by a state of manners unfriendly to the admission of wedded females into society, and opening it only at the expense of reputation to women who were trained for association with men by personal and mental acquirements to which the matron was a stranger.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_22"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_22">14</a> According to this description a Pithamarda would be a sort of professor of all the arts, and as such received as the friend and confidant of the citizen</p>
 <p><a name="fn_23"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_23">15</a> A seat in the form of the letter T.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_24"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_24">16</a> The Vita is supposed to represent somewhat the character of the Parasite of the Greek comedy. It is possible that he was retained about the person of the wealthy and dissipated as a kind of private instructor, as well as an entertaining companion.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_25"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_25">17</a> Vidushaka is evidently the buffoon and jester. Wilson says of him that he is the humble companion, not the servant, of a prince or man of rank, and it is a curious peculiarity that he is always a Brahman. He bears more affinity to Sancho Panza, perhaps than any other character in western fiction, imitating him in his combination of shrewdness and simplicity, his fondness of good living and his love of ease. In the dramas of intrigue he exhibits some of the talents of Mercury, but with less activity and ingenuity, and occasionally suffers by his interference. According to the technical definition of his attributes he is to excite mirth by being ridiculous in person, age, and attire.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_26"></a><a href="kama104.htm#fr_26">18</a> This means, it is presumed, that the citizen should be acquainted with several languages. The middle part of this paragraph might apply to the Nihilists and Fenians of the day, or to secret societies. It was perhaps a reference to the Thugs.</p>
