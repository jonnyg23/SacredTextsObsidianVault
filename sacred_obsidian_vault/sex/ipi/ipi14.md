They were called later, by the Greeks, Gymnosophists; and although they went perfectly naked, no throb or involuntary movement was ever seen in any part of their bodies. Women who were barren oftentimes came and touched their shrivelled member, hoping thereby to become fruitful. Not the slightest emotion was noticed at such times.</p>

Nevertheless it appears to have been found only among nations cognate with the Egyptians and the Phoenicians. The neglect of it by Moses and by the Israelites whom he conducted to the border of the land of Canaan, is a strong presumption against its previous employment by the patriarchs.--Ed.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_57"></a><a href="ipi06.htm#fr_57">58</a> Linga means a "sign" or "token." The truth of the statement in the text would seem to follow, moreover, from the fact, that the figure is sacred only after it has undergone certain ceremonies at the hands of a priest.</p>
 <p></p><p><a name="fn_58"></a><a href="ipi06.htm#fr_58">59</a> Said also to mean a tamarisk tree. It is asserted to have been worshipped in subsequent times.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_64"></a><a href="ipi07.htm#fr_64">65</a> The later Hebrews affected the Persian religion, in which the Sun was the emblem of worship. Abraham evidently had a like preference, being a reputed iconoclast. The lunar religionists employed images in their worship.--Ed.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_67"></a><a href="ipi07.htm#fr_67">68</a> Moses is set forth as the son-in-law of Jethro or Hobab, the Kenite, a priest; and probably became his disciple. At Horeb he learned, by a sacred vision, or initiation, the sacred name. As the Kenites were scribes or hierophants (I Chronicles ii. 55), it is very probable that they had the knowledge of this name, in common with the Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and the sacerdotal orders of other Asiatic nations.--Ed.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_72"></a><a href="ipi08.htm#fr_72">73</a> Much discussion has taken place as to the nature of these animals. For an explanation of the epithet "fiery," see Sanchoniathon, "Of the Serpent" (Cory, op. cit.).</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_82"></a><a href="ipi08.htm#fr_82">83</a> The Sanscrit, Maha vuse, a great sage, seems to be a plausible etymology. Musa as it is pronounced, is the Arabic name; and it may have an affinity with the Muses of Thessaly and the ancient sage Musaeus.--Ed.</p>
 <p></p><p><a name="fn_83"></a><a href="ipi08.htm#fr_83">84</a> According to Pleyte, the Cabalists thought that the soul of Seth had passed into Moses (op. cit., p. 124). It is strange that the name of the Egyptian princess who is said to have brought up Moses is given by Josephus as Thermuthis, this being the name of the sacred asp of Egypt (see supra). We appear, also, to have a reference to the serpent in the name Levi, one of the sons of Jacob, from whom the descent of Moses was traced.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_103"></a><a href="ipi08.htm#fr_103">104</a> It has been suggested that the ram was introduced as an astrological symbol. By the precession of the equinoxes, the sign Aries became the emblem of the Sun, as the genitor of the new year, and so a proper effigy of the Deity. The appearance of the lamb or ram would, of course, create confusion and misapprehension, as well as controversy among those who did not understand astronomy.--Ed.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_120"></a><a href="ipi10.htm#fr_120">121</a> The Hebrew term GN, or garden, appears to be closely related to the Greek word gune, or woman.

The fish was revered at Joppa as the dove was at Nineveh. Was there an esoteric meaning?--Ed.</p>

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_140"></a><a href="ipi12.htm#fr_140">141</a> It should not be forgotten that the Vedic religion was not that of all the Aryan tribes of India.

To come to a proper conclusion on this important point, it is necessary to consider the real position occupied by Gautama in relation to Brahminism.

 <p></p><p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="ipi13.htm#fr_168">169</a> The "Black Virgins" of the French cathedrals prove, when examined critically, to be basalt figures of the goddess Isis. The Virgin Mary succeeded to her form, titles, symbols, rites, and ceremonies. Thus the devotees of Isis carried into the new priesthood the former badges of their profession, the obligation to celibacy, the tonsure, and the surplice. The sacred image still moves in procession as when Juvenal laughed at it--vi. 530--"grege linigero circumdatus et grege calvo"-- escorted by the tonsured, surpliced train. Her proper title, Domina, the exact translation of the Sanscrit Isi, survives, with a slight change in the Madonna. By a singular permutation, the flower borne by each, the lotus, ancient emblem of fecundity, now renamed the lily, is interpreted as significant of the opposite quality. The tinkling sistrum, a sound so well pleasing to the Egyptian goddess, is replaced by that most hideous of noises, the clattering bell. The latter instrument, however, came directly from the Buddhist usages, where it forms as essential an element as of yore in early Celtic Christianity, when the holy bell was the actual type of the Godhead to the new converts. The bell in its present form was unknown to the ancients; its normal shape is Indian, and the first real bell-founders were the Buddhist Chinese. Again, relic-worship seems from the third century to have been virtually the present form of Christianity in the East. A fragment of the bone of a Buddha is indispensable in the founding of a temple of that faith.</p>
 <p>It is astonishing how much of the Egyptian and the second-hand Indian symbolism passed over into the usages of the following times. The high cap and hooked staff of the god became the bishop's mitre and crosier; the term nun is purely Egyptian, and bore its present meaning; the erect oval, symbol of the Female Principle of Nature, became the Vesica Piscis, and a frame for divine things; the Crux Ansata, testifying the union of the Male and Female Principle in the most obvious manner, and denoting fecundity and abundance, is transformed, by a simple inversion, into the Orb surmounted by the Cross, and the ensign of royalty.
