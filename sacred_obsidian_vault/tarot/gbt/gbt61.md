 <p>TRADITION: Success, happy issue, lucky solution, victory, accomplishment, cure, healing, fulfilment. Matter in plenty, perfection, merriment. Reversed it is said to denote: Expedition of affairs, dispatches, achievements, end, conclusion, etc.</p>  
 <p>THEORY: The <i>Water</i> on the house of friends, <i>the Eleventh</i>, must bring concord, etc. Friendship, but on this airy house more platonic than that of the foregoing card. It is the house of surroundings so far mastered by the Ego and on this account 'friendly.' So the soul-life in surroundings that have been mastered will enjoy desirable and 'good' conditions and feel 'happy.' There is no feeling whatever of being hampered or thwarted, or depressed. All goes well and the general sensation is cheerful. It is the sign of a good time, good luck and general satisfaction. As the eleventh house also rules the blood, it is very favourable for health and eventual recuperation. Moreover this house has to do with commerce and business, and the card favours them beyond a doubt, giving a good understanding of opportunity and of the character and wishes of those with whom we have to do, so that we can supply what they ask.</p>  
 <p>CONCLUSION: <i>'A good time,' favourable opportunities, commercial and intellectual friendship, success</i>,</p>

 <p><i>good issue of everything; good health and eventual recuperation, healing. Being in good relations with people. Light-heartedness, joy, holidays</i>.</p>
