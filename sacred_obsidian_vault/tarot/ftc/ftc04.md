 <p><small><i>Two systems—The English method—The foreign—Significations of the cards—Hearts—Diamonds—Clubs—Spades—A short table—Mystic meanings</i>.</small></p>  <h4 align="center">Two Systems.</h4>  
 <p>THERE are two separate systems of explaining the cards individually: one which makes use of the whole pack of fifty-two cards, and another which only employs thirty-two, throwing out the plain cards under seven of each suit.</p>  <h4 align="center">The English Method.</h4>  
 <p>The former plan is sometimes spoken of as the English method, and in it we do not find mention of reversed cards bearing a different meaning from those which come out in the ordinary way. This is probably to be explained by the fact that the larger number in use affords sufficient shades of meaning, and the task of remembering one hundred and four significations would be too heavy for many minds.</p>  <h4 align="center">The Foreign.</h4>  
 <p>In the latter system, which is more distinctly traceable to foreign sources, we get the signification of each card modified, or even contradicted, by its position being upright or the reverse.</p>  
 <p>The following definitions apply to the use of the whole pack, and have been worked up from both ancient and modern sources of information. It must always be borne in mind that the reading of the cards has come down to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>us through many ages, has been passed on to us through count less hands and in varied tongues. Cartomancy has travelled from the East to the West, from the South to the North, and its secrets have been, for the most part, jealously preserved by oral tradition among its weird and fascinating votaries.</p>  <h4 align="center">Significations of the Cards.</h4>  
 <p>The following definitions are based upon one of the oldest authorities dealing with the subject, and have been amplified by some of the more modern meanings now in vogue,</p>  <h5 align="center">HEARTS.</h5>  
 <p><i>Ace</i>.—An important card, whose meaning is affected by its environment. Among hearts it implies love, friendship, and affection; with diamonds, money and news of distant friends; with clubs, festivities, and social or domestic rejoicing; with, spades, disagreements, misunderstandings, contention, or misfortune; individually, it stands for the house.</p>  
 <p><i>King</i>.—A good-hearted man, with strong affections, emotional, and given to rash judgments, possessing more zeal than discretion.</p>  
 <p><i>Queen</i>.—A fair woman, loving and lovable, domesticated, prudent, and faithful.</p>  
 <p><i>Knave</i>.—Not endowed with any sex. Sometimes taken as Cupid; also as the best friend of the inquirer, or as a fair person's thoughts. The cards on either side of the knave are indicative of the good or bad nature of its intentions.</p>  
 <p><i>Ten</i>.—A sign of good fortune. It implies a good heart, happiness, and the prospect of a large family. It counteracts bad cards and confirms good ones in its vicinity.</p>  
 <p><i>Nine</i>.—The wish card. It is the sign of riches, and of high social position accompanied by influence and esteem. It may be affected by the neighbourhood of bad cards.</p>  
 <p><i>Eight</i>.—The pleasures of the table, convivial society. Another meaning implies love and marriage.</p>  
 <p><i>Seven</i>.—A faithless, inconstant friend who may prove an enemy.</p>

 <p>The fifty-two cards in the pack correspond with the fifty-two weeks in the year.</p>  
 <p>The thirteen cards in each suit symbolise the thirteen lunar months, and the thirteen weeks in each quarter.</p>
