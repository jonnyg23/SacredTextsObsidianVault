 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER III</h3>  <h4 align="center">The Selected Pack of Thirty-two Cards</h4>  
 <p align="center"><small><i>Reduced pack generally used—How to indicate reversed cards—Meaning of Hearts—Diamonds—Clubs—Spades</i>.</small></p>  <h4 align="center">Reduced Pack Generally Used.</h4>  
 <p>THE practice of using only thirty-two cards in telling fortune is very general, especially in those systems which have been adopted from or based upon a foreign source. We here give the definitions used in these methods, as they differ in certain respects from those given with the entire pack of fifty-two cards. Special care must be taken when using the selected pack to notice which way the cards come out upon the table, whether upright or reversed, as the meanings of the two positions may be diametrically opposed.</p>  <h4 align="center">How to Indicate Reversed Cards.</h4>  
 <p>In former days it was easier to distinguish between the top and the bottom of a card, but now that they are practically made reversible, with a few exceptions, it is necessary to mark the cards that are to be used for fortune-telling in such a way as to enable the dealer to say at a glance whether the card is reversed or not. These marks should be made before the pack has been used, and need not be altered if the cards are kept solely for this purpose.</p>  
 <p>In the following pages this selected pack is required for several methods, and in the case of the Master Method it is augmented by the four twos taken from the excluded cards.</p>
