 <p>In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, having on the sixth day of the fourth month of summer, in the eighth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Ashâ<i>dh</i>a, descended from the great Vimâna, the all-victorious and all-prosperous Pushpottara, which is like the lotus amongst the best things, where he had lived for twenty Sâgaropamas till the termination of his allotted length of life, of his (divine nature, and of his existence (among gods); here in the continent of <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha,--when of this Avasarpi<i>n</i>î era the Sushama-sushamâ, the Sushamâ, and Sushamadu<i>h</i>shamâ periods, and the greater part of the Du<i>h</i>shamasushamâ period (containing a Ko<i>d</i>âko<i>d</i>i <a name="fr_528"></a><a href="#fn_521"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Sâgaropamas, less forty-two thousand years) had elapsed, and only seventy-two years, eight and a half months were left, after twenty-one Tîrthakaras of the race of Ikshvâku and of the Kâ<i>s</i>yapa gotra, and two of the race of Hari and of the Gautama gotra, on the whole twenty-three Tîrthakaras had appeared,--the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, the last of the Tîrthakaras, took the form of an embryo in the womb of Devânandâ, of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra, the wife of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta, of the gotra of Ko<i>d</i>âla, in the</p>

 <p>brahmanical part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma in the middle of the night, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttaraphalgunî, after his allotted length of life, of his (divine) nature, and of his existence (amongst gods) had come to their termination. (2) <a name="fr_529"></a><a href="#fn_522"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>The knowledge of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra (about this) was threefold; he knew that he was to descend, he knew that he had descended, he knew not when he was descending <a name="fr_530"></a><a href="#fn_523"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>In that night in which the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra took the form of an embryo in the womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra, the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ was on her couch, taking fits of sleep, in a state between sleeping and waking, and having seen the following fourteen illustrious, beautiful, lucky, blest, auspicious, fortunate great dreams, she woke up. (3) To wit:</p>  
 <p>An elephant, a bull, a lion, the anointing (of the goddess <i>S</i>rî), a garland, the moon, the sun, a flag, a vase, a lotus lake, the ocean, a celestial abode, a heap of jewels, and a flame. (4)</p>  
 <p>When the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ, having seen these dreams, woke up, she--glad, pleased, and joyful in her mind, delighted, extremely enraptured, with a heart widening under the influence of happiness, with the hair of her body all erect in their pores like the flowers of the Kadamba touched by rain-drops--firmly fixed the dreams (in her mind), and rose from her couch. Neither hasty nor trembling, with a quick and even <a name="fr_531"></a><a href="#fn_524"><font size="1">3</font></a> gait, like that of the</p>

 <p>royal swan, she went to the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta, and gave him the greeting of victory. Then she comfortably sat down in an excellent chair of state; calm and composed, joining the palms of her hands so as to bring the ten nails together, she laid the folded hands on her head, and spoke thus: (5)</p>  
 <p>'O beloved of the gods, I was just now on my couch taking fits of sleep, in a state between sleeping and waking, when I saw the following fourteen illustrious, &amp;c., great dreams; to wit, an elephant, &amp;c. (6)</p>  
 <p>'O beloved of the gods, what, to be sure, will be the happy result portended by these fourteen illustrious, &amp;c., great dreams?' (7)</p>  
 <p>When the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta had heard and perceived this news from the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ, he, glad, pleased, and joyful (see § 5, down to) rain-drops, firmly fixed the dreams (in his mind), and entered upon considering them. He grasped the meaning of those dreams with his own innate intellect and intuition, which were preceded by reflection, and thus spoke to the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ: (8)</p>  
 <p>'O beloved of the gods, you have seen illustrious dreams; O beloved of the gods, you have seen beautiful, lucky, blest, auspicious, fortunate dreams, which will bring health, joy, long life, bliss, and fortune! We shall have success, O beloved of the gods, we shall have pleasure; we shall have happiness, O beloved of the gods, we shall have a son! Indeed, O beloved of the gods, after the lapse of nine complete months and seven and a half days you will give birth to a lovely and handsome boy with tender hands and feet, with a body containing the entire</p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p>and complete five organs of sense, with the lucky signs, marks, and good qualities; a boy on whose body all limbs will be well formed, and of full volume, weight, and length, of a lovely figure like that of the moon! (9) And this boy, after having passed his childhood <a name="fr_532"></a><a href="#fn_525"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and, with just ripened intellect, having reached the state of youth, will repeat, fully understand, and well retain (in his mind) the four Vedas: the <i>Ri</i>g-veda, Ya<i>g</i>ur-veda, Sâma-veda, Atharva-veda--to which the Itihâsa <a name="fr_533"></a><a href="#fn_526"><font size="1">2</font></a> is added as a fifth, and the Niggha<i>n</i><i>t</i>u <a name="fr_534"></a><a href="#fn_527"><font size="1">3</font></a> as a sixth (Veda)--together with their Aṅgas and Upâṅgas, and the Rahasya <a name="fr_535"></a><a href="#fn_528"><font size="1">4</font></a>; he will know the six Aṅgas, he will be versed in the philosophy of the sixty categories <a name="fr_536"></a><a href="#fn_529"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and well grounded in arithmetic, in phonetics, ceremonial, grammar, metre, etymology, and astronomy <a name="fr_537"></a><a href="#fn_530"><font size="1">6</font></a>, and in many other brahmanical [and monastic] sciences besides. (10) Therefore, O beloved of the gods, you have seen illustrious dreams, &amp;c. (see § 9).'</p>  
 <p>In this way he repeatedly expressed his extreme satisfaction. (11)</p>  
 <p>When the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ had heard and perceived this news from the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta, she--glad, pleased, and joyful, &amp;c. (see § 5)--</p>

 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p>joining the palms of her hands, &amp;c. (see § 5, down to) and spoke thus: (12)</p>  
 <p>'That is so, O beloved of the gods; that is exactly so, O beloved of the gods; that is true, O beloved of the gods; that is beyond doubt, O beloved of the gods; that is what I desire, O beloved of the gods; that is what I accept, O beloved of the gods; that is what I desire and accept, O beloved of the gods; that matter is really such as you have pronounced it.'</p>  
 <p>Thus saying, she accepted the true meaning of the dreams, and enjoyed together with <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta the noble permitted pleasures of human nature. (13)</p>  
 <p>In that period, in that age, <i>S</i>akra,--the chief and king of the gods, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the destroyer of towns, the performer of a hundred sacrifices, the thousand-eyed one, Maghavan, the punisher of the Daitya Pâka, the lord of the southern half of the earth <a name="fr_538"></a><a href="#fn_531"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the lord of the thirty-two thousand celestial abodes, the bestrider of the elephant Airavata, the chief of the Suras, who wears spotless clothes and robes <a name="fr_539"></a><a href="#fn_532"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and puts on garlands and the diadem, whose cheeks were stroked by fine, bright, and trembling earrings of fresh gold [the most prosperous, the most brilliant, the most mighty, the most glorious, the most powerful, and the most happy one], with a splendid body, ornamented with a long down-reaching garland,--this <i>S</i>akra was in the Saudharma Kalpa, in the celestial abode Saudharma Avata<i>m</i>saka, in the council-hall Sudharman, on his throne <i>S</i>akra; he who exercises and maintains the supreme command, government,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>management, guidance, direction, and sovereign power and generalship over the thirty-two thousand gods of the celestial abodes, the eighty-four thousand gods of a rank equal with that of himself, the thirty-two chief gods, the four guardians of the world, the eight principal queens with their trains, the three courts, the seven armies, and the seven commanders of these armies. He was then enjoying the permitted pleasures of divine nature under the great din of uninterrupted story-telling, dramatical plays, singing, and music, as beating of time, performance on the Vî<i>n</i>â, the Tûrya, the great drum, and the Pa<i>t</i>upa<i>t</i>aha. (I 4)</p>  
 <p>And he viewed this whole continent <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa with his extensive (knowledge called) Avadhi. There he saw in the continent <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bhâratavarsha, in the southern half of Bharata, in the brahmanical part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma, the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvira taking the form of an embryo in the womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra, wife of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta of the gotra of Ko<i>d</i>âla; and--glad, pleased, and joyful in his mind, delighted, extremely enraptured, with a heart widening under the influence of happiness, with the hair of his body bristling and erect in their pores like the fragrant flowers of Nîpa when touched by rain-drops, with his eyes and mouth open like full-blown lotuses, with his excellent, various <a name="fr_540"></a><a href="#fn_533"><font size="1">1</font></a>, trembling bracelets, with diadem and earrings, his breast lighted up by necklaces, wearing long and swinging ornaments with a pearl pendant--the chief of the gods rose</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p>with confusion, hasty and trembling from his throne, descended from the footstool, took off his shoes which were by a clever artist set with Vaidûrya and excellent Rish<i>t</i>a and A<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ana <a name="fr_541"></a><a href="#fn_534"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and ornamented with glittering jewels and precious stones, threw his seamless robe over his left shoulder, and, arranging the fingers of his hands in the shape of a bud, he advanced seven or eight steps towards the Tîrthakara. Bending his left knee and reposing on the right one, he three times placed his head on the ground and lifted it a little; then he raised his bracelet-encumbered arms, and joining the palms of his hands so as to bring the ten nails together, laid the hands on his head and spoke thus: (15)</p>  
 <p>'Reverence to the Arhats and Bhagavats; to the Âdikaras, the Tîrthakaras, the perfectly-enlightened ones; to the highest of men, the lions among men, the flowers among mankind <a name="fr_542"></a><a href="#fn_535"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the Gandhahastins among men; to the highest in the world, the guides of the world, the benefactors of the world, the lights of the world, the enlighteners of the world; to the givers of safety, to the givers of sight, to the givers of the road, to the givers of shelter, to the givers of life, to the givers of knowledge <a name="fr_543"></a><a href="#fn_536"><font size="1">3</font></a>; to the givers of the law, the preachers of the law, the lords of the law, the leaders of the law, the universal emperors of the best law; to the light, the help, the shelter, the refuge, the resting-place, the possessors of unchecked knowledge</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>and intuition who have got rid of unrighteousness; to the conquerors and the granters of conquest, the saved and the saviours, the enlightened and the enlighteners, the liberated and the liberators, to the all-knowing ones, the all-seeing ones, to those who have reached the happy, stable, unstained, infinite, unperishable, undecaying place, called the path of perfection, whence there is no return; reverence to the <i>G</i>inas who have conquered fear.</p>  
 <p>'Reverence to the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, the Âdikara, the last of the Tîrthakaras who was predicted by the former Tîrthakaras, &amp;c. <a name="fr_544"></a><a href="#fn_537"><font size="1">1</font></a> I here adore the Revered One yonder, may the Revered One yonder see me here!' With these words he adored, he worshipped the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvira, and sat down on his excellent throne facing the east. Then the following internal, reflectional, desirable idea occurred to the mind of <i>S</i>akra, the chief of kings and gods: (16)</p>  
 <p>'It never has happened, nor does it happen, nor will it happen, that Arhats, <i>K</i>akravartins, Baladevas, or Vasudevas, in the past, present, or future, should be born in low families, mean families, degraded families, poor families, indigent families, beggars' families, or brahmanical families. (17) For indeed Arhats, <i>K</i>akravartins, Baladevas, and Vasudevas, in the past, present, and future, are born in high families, noble families, royal families, noblemen's families, in families belonging to the race of Ikshvâku, or of Hari, or in other suchlike families of pure descent on both sides. (18)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Now this is something which moves the wonder of the world: it happens in the lapse of numberless Avasarpi<i>n</i>îs and Utsarpi<i>n</i>îs, because the imperishable, indescribable, and undestroyable Karman relating to name and gotra must take effect, that Arhats, &amp;c., in the past, present, and future, descend in (i.e. take the form of an embryo in the womb of a woman belonging to) low families, &amp;c.; but they are never brought forth by birth from such a womb. (19) This Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, now, in the continent <i>G</i>ambudvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the brahmanical part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma, has taken the form of an embryo in the womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra, wife of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta of the gotra of Ko<i>d</i>âla. (20) Hence it is the established custom of all past, present, and future <i>S</i>akras, chiefs and kings of the gods, to cause the Arhats and Bhagavats to be removed from such-like low, mean, &amp;c., families, to such-like high, noble, &amp;c., families. (21) It is, therefore, better that I should cause the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, the last of the Tîrthakaras who was predicted by the former Tîrthakaras, to be removed from the brahmanical part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma, from the womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra, wife of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta of the gotra of Ko<i>d</i>âla, to the Kshatriya part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma, and to be placed as an embryo in the womb of the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ of the Vâsish<i>th</i>a gotra, wife of the Kshatriya Siddhârtha of the Kâ<i>s</i>yapa gotra, belonging to the clan of the <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i> Kshatriya,; and to cause the embryo of the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ of the Vâsish<i>th</i>a gotra to be placed in the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra.'</p>  
 <p>Thus he reflected and called Hari<i>n</i>egamesi <a name="fr_545"></a><a href="#fn_538"><font size="1">1</font></a>, the divine commander of the foot troops; having called him, he spoke thus: (22)</p>  
 <p>Well, now, beloved of the gods, it never has happened, &amp;c. (§§ 17-20 are verbally repeated). (23-25)</p>  
 <p>'Therefore, go now and remove the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra from the brahmanical part, &amp;c., and place the embryo of the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ, &amp;c. (see § 21). Having done this, return quickly to report on the execution of my orders.' (26)</p>  
 <p>When Hari<i>n</i>egamesi, the divine commander of the foot troops, was thus spoken to by <i>S</i>akra, the chief and king of the gods, he--glad, pleased, and joyful, &amp;c. (see § 15)--laid his folded hands on his head and modestly accepted the words of command, saying, 'Just as your Majesty commands.' After this he left the presence of <i>S</i>akra, the chief and king of the gods, and descended towards the northeastern quarter; then he transformed himself through his magical power of transformation, and stretched himself out for numerous Yo<i>g</i>anas like a staff, (during which he seized) jewels, Va<i>g</i>ra, Vai<i>d</i>ûrya, Lohitâksha, Masâragalla, Ha<i>m</i>sagarbha, Pulaka, Saugandhika, <i>G</i>yotisara, A<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ana, A<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>anapulaka, <i>G</i>âtarûpa, Subhaga, Spha<i>t</i>ika, and Rish<i>t</i>a; (of these precious materials) he rejected the gross particles, and retained the subtle particles. (27) Then</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="green">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p>for a second time he transformed himself through his magical power of transformation, and produced the definitive form (which gods adopt on entering the world of men); having done so, he passed with that excellent, hasty, trembling, active, impetuous, victorious, exalted, and quick divine motion of the gods right through numberless continents and oceans, and arrived in <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the brahmanical part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma, at the house of the Brâhma<i>n</i>a <i>Ri</i>shabhadatta, where the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ dwelt. Having arrived there, he made his bow in the sight of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, and cast the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ, together with her retinue, into a deep sleep; then he took off all unclean particles, and brought forth the clean particles, and saying, 'May the Venerable One permit me,' he took the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra in the folded palms of his hands without hurting him. Thus he went to the Kshatriya part of the town Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>agrâma, to the house of the Kshatriya Siddhârtha, where the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ dwelt; he cast her and her attendants into a deep sleep, took off all unclean particles, and brought forth the clean particles, and placed the embryo of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvira in the womb of the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ, and the embryo of the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ he placed in the womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ of the <i>G</i>âlandharâya<i>n</i>a gotra. Having done so, he returned in that direction in which he had come <a name="fr_546"></a><a href="#fn_539"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (28) With that excellent, &amp;c. (see § 28), divine motion</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_229"><font size="1" color="green">p. 229</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the gods, he flew upwards right through numberless continents and oceans, taking thousands of Yo<i>g</i>anas in each motion, and arrived in the Saudharma Kalpa, in the divine abode called Saudharma Avata<i>m</i>saka, where <i>S</i>akra, the chief and king of the gods, sat on the throne called <i>S</i>akra, and reported to <i>S</i>akra, the chief and king of the gods, on the execution of his orders.</p>  
 <p>In that period, in that age the knowledge of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was threefold; he knew that he was to be removed; he knew that he was removed; he knew not when he was being removed <a name="fr_547"></a><a href="sbe2283.htm#fn_540"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (29)</p>  
 <p>In that period, in that age, on the thirteenth day of the third month of the rainy season, in the fifth fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Â<i>s</i>vina, after the lapse of eighty-two days, on the eighty-third day current (since his conception), the embryo of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was, on the command of <i>S</i>akra, safely removed by Hari<i>n</i>egamesi from the womb of the Brâhma<i>n</i>î Devânandâ to that of the Kshatriyâ<i>n</i>î Tri<i>s</i>alâ <a name="fr_548"></a><a href="sbe2283.htm#fn_541"><font size="1">2</font></a>, in the middle of the night, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttaraphalgunî.
