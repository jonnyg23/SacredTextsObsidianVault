 <p>A monk or a nun on the pilgrimage, in whose way there are walls or ditches or ramparts or gates, &amp;c. (see II, 3, 2, § 14), hill houses, palaces, underground houses, houses in trees, mountain caves, a sacred tree or pillar, workshops, &amp;c. (see II, 2, 2, § 8), should not look at them holding up their arms, pointing at them with their fingers, bowing up and down. Then they may circumspectly wander from village to village. (1)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on the pilgrimage, on whose way there are marshes, pasture-grounds, moats, fortified places, thickets, strongholds in thickets, woods, mountains, strongholds on mountains, caves <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_410"><font size="1">1</font></a>, tanks, lakes, rivers, ponds, lotus ponds, long winding ponds, water-sheets, rows of water-sheets, should not look at them holding up their arms, &amp;c. (see § 1). (2)</p>  
 <p>The Kevalin says: This is the reason: The deer, cattle, birds, snakes, animals living in water, on land, in the air might be disturbed or frightened, and strive to get to a fold or (other place of) refuge, (thinking): 'The <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a will harm me!'</p>  
 <p>Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &amp;c., that he should not look at the objects (mentioned in § 2) holding up his arms, &amp;c. <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">2</font></a> (3)</p>

 <p>A monk or a nun, wandering from village to village together with the master or teacher, should not touch the master's or teacher's hand with their own, &amp;c.; but without touching or being touched they should circumspectly wander from village to village together with the master or teacher. (4)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun, wandering from village to village together with the master or teacher, might be met on the road by travellers and asked: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! who are you? whence do you come, and where do you go?' The master or teacher may answer and explain; but whilst the master or teacher answers and explains, one should not mix in their conversation. Thus they may wander from village to village with a superior priest <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (5)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun, wandering from village to village with a superior priest, should not touch the superior's hand with their own, &amp;c. (see § 4). (6).</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun, wandering from village to village with superior priests, might be met on the road by travellers, and be asked: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! who are you?' He who has the highest rank of them all, should answer and explain; but whilst the superior answers and explains, one should not mix in their conversation, &amp;c. (see § 5). (7)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun, wandering from village to village, might be met on the road by travellers, and be asked: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! did you see somebody on the road? viz. a man, cow, buffalo, cattle, bird, snake, or aquatic animal--tell us, show</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></a></p>  
 <p>us!' The mendicant should not tell it, nor show it, he should not comply with their request, but look on silently, or, though knowing it, he should say that he did not know. Then he may circumspectly wander from village to village. (8)</p>  
 <p>He should act in the same manner, if asked about bulbs of water-plants, roots, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, water in the neighbourhood, or a kindled fire; (9)</p>  
 <p>Likewise, if asked about (transports of) corn, waggons, cars, &amp;c. (see II, 3, 2, § 16). (10)</p>  
 <p>Likewise, if asked: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! how large is this village or scot-free town, &amp;c.?' (11)</p>  
 <p>Likewise, if asked: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! How far is it to that village or scot-free town, &amp;c.?' (12)</p>  
 <p>If a monk or a nun, wandering from village to village, sees a vicious cow coming towards them, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 5, § 3), they should not, from fear of them, leave the road, or go into another road, nor enter a thicket, wood, or stronghold, nor climb a tree, nor take a plunge in a large and extended water-sheet, nor desire a fold or any other place of refuge, or an army or a caravan; but undisturbed, the mind not directed to outward things, they should collect themselves for contemplation; thus they may circumspectly wander from village to village. (13)</p>  
 <p>If the road of a monk or a nun on the pilgrimage lies through a forest, in which, as they know, there stroll bands of many thieves desirous of their property, they should not, for fear of them, leave the road, &amp;c. (all as in § 13). (14)</p>  
 <p>If these thieves say, 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! bring us your clothes, &amp;c., give them, put them down!' the mendicant should not give or put them down.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Nor should he reclaim (his things) by imploring (the thieves), or by folding his hands, or by moving their compassion, but by religious exhortation or by remaining silent. (15)</p>  
 <p>If the thieves, resolving to do it themselves, bully him, &amp;c., tear off his clothes, &amp;c., he should not lodge an information in the village or at the king's palace; nor should he go to a layman, and say, 'O long-lived householder! these thieves, resolving to do (the robbing) themselves, have bullied me, &amp;c., they have torn off my clothes,' &amp;c. He should neither think so, nor speak so; but undisturbed, &amp;c. (see § 13).</p>  
 <p>This is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>Thus I say. (16)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_410"></a><a href="sbe2263.htm#fr_416">145:1</a> The word aga<i>d</i>a has been left out in the translation.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_411"></a><a href="sbe2263.htm#fr_417">145:2</a> The passage closes: 'then he may circumspectly wander from village to village together with the master and teacher (âyariova<i>g</i><i>gh</i>âya).' But as the master and teacher have not been mentioned before, and will be mentioned in the next Sûtra, it is almost certain that the words in question have been brought over from the next Sûtra, or that they ought to be supplied to all Sûtras from the beginning of the third lesson.</p>

I am not sure if the phrase ought not to be translated, with due respect for his superior.</p>
