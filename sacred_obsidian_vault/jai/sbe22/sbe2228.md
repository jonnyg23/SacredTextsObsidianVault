 <p>Thus I say: a lake is full of water, it is in an even plain, it is free from dust, it harbours (many fish) <a name="fr_219"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Look! he (the teacher) stands in the stream (of knowledge) and is guarded in all directions. Look! there are great Seers in the world, wise, awakened, free from acts. Perceive the truth: from a desire of (a pious) end they chose a religious life. Thus I say. (1)</p>  
 <p>He whose mind is always wavering, does not reach abstract contemplation <a name="fr_220"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">2</font></a>. Some, bound (by worldly ties), are followers (i.e. understand the truth); some who are not bound, are followers. How should he not despond who amongst followers is a non-follower? 'But that is truth beyond doubt, what has been declared by the <i>G</i>inas.' (2)</p>  
 <p>Whatever <a name="fr_221"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">3</font></a> a faithful, well-disposed man, on entering the order, thought to be true, that may afterwards appear to him true; what he thought to be true, that may afterwards appear to him untrue; what he thought to be untrue, that may afterwards appear to him true; what he thought to be untrue, that may afterwards appear to him true. What he thinks to be true, that may, on consideration, appear to him true, whether it be true or untrue. What he thinks to be untrue, that may, on consideration, appear to him untrue, whether it be true or untrue. But he</p>

 <p>who reflects should say unto him who does not reflect: Consider it to be true. Thus the connection (i.e. the continuity of sins) is broken. (3)</p>  
 <p>Regard this as the course of the zealous one, who stands (in obedience to the spiritual guide). In this point do not show yourself a fool <a name="fr_222"></a><a href="sbe2229.htm#fn_219"><font size="1">1</font></a>!</p>  
 <p>As it would be unto thee, so it is with him whom thou intendest to kill. As it would be unto thee, so it is with him whom thou intendest to tyrannise over. As it would be unto thee, so it is with him whom thou intendest to torment. I n the same way (it is with him) whom thou intendest to punish, and to drive away. The righteous man who lives up to these sentiments, does therefore neither kill nor cause others to kill (living beings). He should not intentionally cause the same punishment for himself <a name="fr_223"></a><a href="sbe2229.htm#fn_220"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (4)</p>  
 <p>The Self is the knower (or experiencer), and the knower is the Self. That through which one knows, is the Self. With regard to this (to know) it (the Self) is established <a name="fr_224"></a><a href="sbe2229.htm#fn_221"><font size="1">3</font></a>. Such is he who maintains the right doctrine of Self. This subject has truly been explained. Thus I say. (5)</p>
