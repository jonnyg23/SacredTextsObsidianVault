 <p>To a naked <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">1</font></a> monk the thought occurs: I can bear the pricking of grass, the influence of cold and heat, the stinging of flies and mosquitos; these and other various painful feelings I can sustain, but I cannot leave off the covering of the privities. Then he may cover his privities with a piece of cloth <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>A naked monk who perseveres in this conduct, sustains repeatedly these and other various painful feelings: the grass pricks him, heat and cold attack him, flies and mosquitos sting him. A naked monk (should be) aspiring to freedom from bonds. Penance suits him. Knowing what the Revered One has declared, one should thoroughly and in all respects conform to it. (1)</p>  
 <p>A monk who has come to any of the following resolutions,--having collected food, &amp;c., I shall give of it to other monks, and I shall eat (what they have) brought; (or) having collected food, &amp;c., I shall give of it to other monks, but I shall not eat</p>

Penance suits him. Knowing what the Revered One has declared, one should thoroughly conform to it. (4)</p>

 <p>Thus I say. (5)</p>
