 <p>Some are awakened as middle-aged men and exert themselves well, having, as clever men, heard and received the word of the learned <a name="fr_267"></a><a href="#fn_264"><font size="1">1</font></a>. The noble ones have impartially preached the law. Those who are awakened, should not wish for pleasure, nor do harm, nor desire (any forbidden things). A person who is without desires and does no harm unto any living beings in the whole world, is called by me 'unfettered.' (1)</p>  
 <p>One free from passions understands perfectly the bright one <a name="fr_268"></a><a href="#fn_265"><font size="1">2</font></a>, knowing birth in the upper and nether regions.</p>  
 <p>'Bodies increase through nourishment, they are frail in hardships.' See some whose organs are failing (give way to weakness).</p>  
 <p>A person who has no desires, cherishes pity. He who understands the doctrine of sin, is a mendicant who knows the time, the strength, the measure, the occasion, the conduct, the religious precept; he disowns all things not requisite for religious purposes,</p>

 <p>in time exerts himself, is under no obligations; he proceeds securely (on the road to final liberation) after having cut off both (love and hate) <a name="fr_269"></a><a href="sbe2238.htm#fn_266"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (2)</p>  
 <p>A householder approaching a mendicant whose limbs tremble for cold, may say:</p>  
 <p>O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! are you not subject to the influences of your senses?</p>  
 <p>O long-lived householder! I am not subject to the influences of my senses. But I cannot sustain the feeling of cold. Yet it does not become me to kindle or light a fire <a name="fr_270"></a><a href="sbe2238.htm#fn_267"><font size="1">2</font></a>, that I may warm or heat myself; nor (to procure that comfort) through the order of others.</p>  
 <p>Perhaps after the mendicant has spoken thus, the other kindles or lights a fire that he may warm or heat himself. But the mendicant should well observe and understand this, that he may order him to show no such obsequiousness. Thus I say. (3)</p>
