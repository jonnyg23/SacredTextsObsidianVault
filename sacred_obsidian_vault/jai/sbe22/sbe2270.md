 <p>'I shall become a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a who owns no house, no property, no sons, no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.' Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village or scot-free town, &amp;c., take himself, or induce others to take, or allow others to take, what has not been given. A mendicant should not take or appropriate any property, viz. an umbrella <a name="fr_445"></a><a href="#fn_439"><font size="1">2</font></a> or vessel or stick, &amp;c. (see II, 2, 3, § 2), of those monks together with whom he stays, without getting their permission, and without having inspected and wiped (the object in question); but having got their permission, and having inspected and wiped (the object in question), he may take or appropriate it <a name="fr_446"></a><a href="#fn_440"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (1)</p>  
 <p>He may beg for a domicile in a traveller's hall, &amp;c.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (see II, 1, 8, § 2), having reflected (on its fitness for a stay); he should ask permission to take possession of it from him who is the landlord or the steward of that place: 'Indeed, O long-lived one! for the time, and in the space which you concede us, we shall dwell here. We shall take possession of the place for as long a time as the place belongs to you; and of as much of it as belongs to you; for as many fellow-ascetics (as shall stand in need of it); afterwards we shall take to wandering <a name="fr_447"></a><a href="#fn_441"><font size="1">1</font></a>.' (2)</p>  
 <p>Having got possession of some place, a mendicant should invite to that food, &amp;c., which he himself has collected, any fellow-ascetics arriving there who follow the same rules and are zealous brethren; but he should not invite them to anything of which he has taken possession for the sake of somebody else. (3)</p>  
 <p>Having got possession of some place (in a traveller's hall, &amp;c.), a mendicant should offer a footstool or bench or bed or couch, which he himself has begged, to any fellow-ascetics arriving there who follow other rules than he, yet are zealous brethren; but he should not offer them anything of which he has taken possession for the sake of somebody else. (4)</p>  
 <p>Having got possession of some place in a traveller's hall, &amp;c., a mendicant might ask from a householder or his sons the loan of a needle or a Pippalaka <a name="fr_448"></a><a href="#fn_442"><font size="1">2</font></a> or an ear-picker or a nail-parer, he should not give or lend it to somebody else; but</p>

 <p>having done that for which he wanted one of the above articles, he should go with that article there (where the householder, &amp;c., is), and stretching out his hands or laying the article on the ground, he should, after consideration, say: 'Here it is! here it is!' But he should not with his own hand put it in the hand of the householder. (5)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun should not take possession of anything <a name="fr_449"></a><a href="sbe2271.htm#fn_443"><font size="1">1</font></a> on the bare ground, on wet ground, where there are eggs, &amp;c.; nor on pillars or such an above-ground place (II, 2, 1, § 7); nor on a wall, &amp;c.; nor on the trunk of a tree, &amp;c.; nor where the householder or fire or water, or women or children or cattle are, and where it is not fit for a wise man to enter or to leave, &amp;c., nor to meditate on the law; nor where they have to pass through the householder's abode or to which there is no road, and where it is not fit, &amp;c.; nor where the householder or his wife, &amp;c., bully or scold each other, &amp;c. (see II, 2, 1, § 9, and 3, § 7); nor where they rub or anoint each other's body with oil or ghee or butter or grease; nor where they take a bath, &amp;c.; nor where they go about naked, &amp;c. (all as in II, 2, 3, §§ 7-12).</p>  
 <p>This is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>Thus I say. (6-12)</p>
