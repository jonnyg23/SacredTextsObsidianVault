 <p>A monk or a nun wanting to get a bowl, may beg for one made of bottle-gourd or wood or clay, or such-like bowls. If he be a youthful, young, &amp;c. (see II, 5, 1, § 1) monk, he may carry with him one bowl, not two <a name="fr_439"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">2</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun should not resolve to go farther than half a Yo<i>g</i>ana to get a bowl.</p>  
 <p>As regards the acceptance of a bowl, those four precepts which have been given in (the First Lesson of the First Lecture, called) <a name="fr_440"></a><a href="#fn_434"><font size="1">3</font></a> Begging of Food, concerning one fellow-ascetic, &amp;c., should be repeated here, the fifth is that concerning many <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as.</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun should not accept a bowl which the layman has, for the mendicant's sake, bought, &amp;c. (see the Lecture called Begging of Clothes <a name="fr_441"></a><a href="#fn_435"><font size="1">4</font></a>). (I )</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun should not accept any very expensive bowls of the following description: bowls made of iron, tin, lead, silver, gold, brass, a mixture of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></a></p>  
 <p>gold, silver, and copper, pearl, glass, mother of pearl, horn, ivory, cloth, stone, or leather; for such very expensive bowls are impure and unacceptable. (2)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun should not accept bowls which contain a band of the same precious materials specialised in § 2; for &amp;c. (3)</p>  
 <p>For the avoidance of these occasions to sin there are four rules for begging a bowl to be known by the mendicants.</p>  
 <p>Now this is the first rule:</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun may beg for a bowl specifying its quality, viz. bottle-gourd or wood or clay. If they beg for such a bowl, or the householder gives it, they may accept it, for it is pure and acceptable.</p>  
 <p>This is the first rule. (4)</p>  
 <p>Now follows the second rule:</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun may ask for a bowl, which they have well inspected, from the householder or his wife, &amp;c. After consideration, they should say: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) please give me one of these bowls, viz. one made of bottle-gourds or wood or clay.' If they beg for such a bowl, or the householder gives it, they may accept it; for &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>This is the second rule. (5)</p>  
 <p>Now follows the third rule:</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun may beg for a bowl which has been used by the former owner or by many people. If they beg for it, &amp;c. (see § 5).</p>  
 <p>This is the third rule. (6)</p>  
 <p>Now follows the fourth rule:</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun may beg for a left-off bowl which no other <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a or Brâhma<i>n</i>a, guest, pauper, or beggar wants. If they beg for it, &amp;c. (see § 5).</p>  
 <p>This is the fourth rule.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></a></p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun having adopted one of these four rules should not say, &amp;c. (see II, 1, t r, § 12, all down to) we respect each other accordingly. (7)</p>  
 <p>A householder may perhaps say to a mendicant begging in the prescribed way: 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! return after a month,' &amp;c. (all as in the Lecture called Begging of Clothes <a name="fr_442"></a><a href="#fn_436"><font size="1">1</font></a>). (8)</p>  
 <p>The householder may say (to one of his people): 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) fetch that bowl, rub it with oil, ghee, fresh butter or marrow, we shall give it,' &amp;c. (see II, 5, 1, § 11); or wash, wipe, or rub it with perfumes,' &amp;c.; or 'wash it with cold or hot water;' or 'empty it of the bulbs,' &amp;c. (see II, 5, 1, §§ 11 and 12). (9)</p>  
 <p>The householder may say (to the mendicant): 'O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! stay a while till they have cooked or prepared our food, &amp;c., then we shall give you, O long-lived one! your alms-bowl filled with food or drink; it is not good, not meet that a mendicant should get an empty alms-bowl.' After consideration, the mendicant should answer: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) it is indeed not meet for me to eat or drink food &amp;c. which is âdhâkarmika; do not cook or prepare it; if you want to give me anything, give it as it is.' After these words the householder might offer him the alms-bowl filled with food or drink which had been cooked or prepared: he should not accept such an alms-bowl, for it is impure and unacceptable. (10)</p>  
 <p>Perhaps the householder will bring and give the mendicant an alms-bowl; the mendicant should then, after consideration, say: 'O long-lived one! (or, O</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></a></p>  
 <p>sister!) I shall in your presence closely inspect the interior of the bowl.'</p>  
 <p>The Kevalin says: This is the reason: In the alms-bowl there might be living beings or seeds or grass. Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &amp;c., that he should closely inspect the interior of the alms-bowl. (11)</p>  
 <p>All that has been said in the Lecture called Begging of Clothes (II, 5, I, § 15 down to the end) is mutatis mutandis to be repeated here. (In § 15, add before perfumes) with oil, ghee, butter or marrow.</p>  
 <p>This is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>Thus I say. (12)</p>
