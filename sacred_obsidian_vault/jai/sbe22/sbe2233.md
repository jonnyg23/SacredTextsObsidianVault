 <p>The disciples are thus regularly instructed, day and night, by the knowledge-endowed great heroes, receiving knowledge from them. Some, being seduced from the calmness of the mind, adopt rough manners. Some, living in chastity, dispute the authority (of the teacher), others hear and understand his words; they intend to lead a godly life, but having left the world <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">2</font></a>, they are not qualified (for a religious life). Others, being incensed by lusts,</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>greedy, sensual, 'do not care for abstract meditation and religious instruction: these men speak harshly unto the teacher.' It is a second folly of the slow-minded to call virtuous, calm, religiously living men worthless.</p>  
 <p>Some, turning from (control), assign its difficulty as their reason (for doing so) <a name="fr_253"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">1</font></a>; others, falling from the pure knowledge and defiling the creed, though not without devotion, for the love of life change (their vows). 'When they feel the hardships (of a religious life) they slide back, for their love of life.' Their leaving the world is a bad leaving. (1)</p>  
 <p>Those who deserve to be called fools, are born again and again. Standing low (in learning or control) they will exalt themselves (and say) in their pride: I am learned. They speak harshly unto the passionless; they upbraid them with their former trades, or revile them with untrue reproaches <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">2</font></a>. The wise, therefore, should know the law. Thou lovest unrighteousness, because thou art young, and lovest acts, and sayest: 'Kill beings;' thou killest them or consentest to their being killed by others. (Such a man) thinks contemptuously: A very severe religion has been proclaimed. Sinking in opposition to the law, he is called murderer. Thus I say. (2)</p>  
 <p>Some think: What have I to do with this or that man? Thus they leave father and mother, kith and kin, like heroes exerting themselves, free from murder. Look! the pious and calm become</p>

 <p>desponding; the rising, cast down. Those troubled with sensuality, the cowardly men become perverters of the faith <a name="fr_255"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Therefore the reputation of some becomes bad. He is an apostate ascetic! He is an apostate ascetic! (3)</p>  
 <p>Look! Some, though living with religious, pious, calm, and worthy (monks), are not religious, nor pious, nor calm, nor worthy. Knowing them, the learned, the wise, the steadfast hero will always be victorious through the right faith. Thus I say. (4)</p>
