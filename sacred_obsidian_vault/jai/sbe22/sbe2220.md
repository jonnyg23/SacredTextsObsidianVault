 <p>The Arhats and Bhagavats of the past, present, and future, all say thus, speak thus, declare thus, explain thus: all breathing, existing, living, sentient creatures <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">1</font></a> should not be slain, nor treated with violence, nor abused, nor tormented, nor driven away. (1)</p>  
 <p>This is the pure, unchangeable, eternal law, which the clever ones, who understand the world, have declared: among the zealous and the not zealous, among the faithful and the not faithful, among the not cruel and the cruel, among those who have worldly weakness and those who have not, among those who like social bonds and those who do not: 'that is the truth, that is so, that is proclaimed in this (creed).' (2)</p>  
 <p>Having adopted (the law), one should not hide it, nor forsake it. Correctly understanding the law, one should arrive at indifference for the impressions of the senses <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">2</font></a>, and 'not act on the motives of the world.' 'He who is not of this mind <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">3</font></a>, how should he come to the other <a name="fr_189"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">4</font></a>?'</p>

 <p>What has been said here, has been seen (by the omniscient ones), heard (by the believers), acknowledged (by the faithful), and thoroughly understood by them. Those who acquiesce and indulge (in worldly pleasures), are born again and again. 'Day and night exerting thyself, steadfast,' always having ready wisdom, perceive that the careless (stand) outside (of salvation); if careful, thou wilt always conquer. Thus I say. (3)</p>
