 <p>In that period, in that age lived the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi, the five most important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ. In <i>K</i>itrâ he descended from heaven, &amp;c. (see § 149, down to) obtained final liberation. (1 70)</p>  
 <p>In that period, in that age, in the fourth month of the rainy season, in the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Kârttika, on its twelfth day, the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi descended from the great Vimâna, called Aparâ<i>g</i>ita, where he had lived for thirty-six Sâgaropamas, here on the continent <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the town of <i>S</i>auripura <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ, he took the form of an embryo in the womb of the queen <i>S</i>ivâ, wife of the king Samudravi<i>g</i>aya, &amp;c. (the seeing of the dreams, the accumulation of riches, &amp;c., should be repeated here). (171)</p>  
 <p>In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi--after the lapse of nine months and seven and a half days, in the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of <i>S</i>râva<i>n</i>a, on its fifth day, &amp;c.--(<i>S</i>ivâ), perfectly healthy herself; gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. (Repeat the account of the birth, substituting the name Samudravi<i>g</i>aya,</p>

 <p>The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi, clever, &amp;c. (see §§ 155157, all down to) indigent persons. (172) In the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Srâva<i>n</i>a, on its sixth day riding in his palankin called Uttarakurâ, and followed on his way by a train of gods, men, and Asuras, &amp;c. (Arish<i>t</i>anemi) went right through the town of Dvârâvatî to the park called Revatîka, and proceeded to the excellent A<i>s</i>oka tree. There, &amp;c. (see § 116, down to) five handfuls. When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, he put on a divine robe, and together with a thousand persons he tore out his hair, and leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (173)</p>  
 <p>The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi for fifty-four days neglected his body, &amp;c. (see §§ 117-120). During the fifty-fifth day--it was in the third month of the rainy season, in the fifth fortnight, the dark fortnight of Â<i>s</i>vina, on its fifteenth day, in the last part of the day, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ--(Arish<i>t</i>anemi) under a Ve<i>t</i>asa <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">2</font></a> tree on the summit of mount Girnâr <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">3</font></a>, after fasting three and a half days without drinking water, &amp;c., obtained infinite, &amp;c., highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &amp;c. (see § 121, down to) moment. (174)</p>

 <p>The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi had eighteen Ga<i>n</i>as and eighteen Ga<i>n</i>adharas. (175)</p>  
 <p>The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi had an excellent community of eighteen thousand <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as with Varadatta at their head; (176) forty thousand nuns with Ârya Yakshi<i>n</i>î at their head; (177) one hundred and sixty-nine thousand lay votaries with Nanda at their head; (178) three hundred and thirty-six thousand <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">1</font></a> female lay votaries with Mahâsuvratâ at their head; (179) four hundred sages who knew the fourteen Pûrvas, &amp;c.; (180) fifteen hundred sages who were possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; fifteen hundred Kevalins; fifteen hundred sages who could transform themselves; one thousand sages of vast intellect; eight hundred professors; sixteen hundred sages in their last birth; fifteen hundred male and three thousand female disciples who had reached perfection.</p>  
 <p>The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi instituted, &amp;c. (see § 146, down to) the former ended in the eighth generation, the latter in the twelfth year of his Kevaliship. (181)</p>  
 <p>In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi lived three centuries as a prince, fifty-four days in a state inferior to perfection, something less than seven centuries as a Kevalin, full seven centuries as a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a, a thousand years on the whole. When his fourfold Karman was exhausted and in this Avasarpi<i>n</i>î era a great part of the Du<i>h</i>shamasushamâ period had elapsed, in the fourth month of summer, in the eighth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Ashâ<i>dh</i>a, on its eighth day, in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ, (Arish<i>t</i>anemi), after fasting a month</p>

 <p>without drinking water, on the summit of mount Girnâr, in the company of five hundred and thirty-six monks, in a squatting position, died, &amp;c. (all down to) freed from all pains. (182)</p>  
 <p>Since the time that the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi died, &amp;c. (all down to) freed from all pains, eighty-four thousand years have elapsed, of the eighty-fifth millennium nine centuries have elapsed, of the tenth century this is the eightieth year. (183)</p>
