 <p>Though some know the misery of the world, have relinquished their former connections, have given up ease, live in chastity, and, whether monk or layman, thoroughly understand the law, they are not able (to persevere in a religious life). The ill-disposed, giving up the robe, alms-bowl, blanket, and broom, do not bear the continuous hardships that are difficult to bear. He who prefers pleasures will, now or after an hour <a name="fr_240"></a><a href="#fn_237"><font size="1">2</font></a>, be deprived (of the body <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_238"><font size="1">3</font></a>, not to recover it) for an infinite space of time. And thus they do not cross (the sa<i>m</i>sâra), for the sake of these pleasures which entail evil consequences and are associated with others of their kind. (1)</p>  
 <p>But some who embrace the law, will practise it, being careful about its outward signs; not giving way to worldliness, but being firm. Knowing (and renouncing) all lust, a devout man becomes a great sage when he breaks all bonds, thinking: Nothing</p>

 <p>belongs to me. A man who, thinking, I am I <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_239"><font size="1">1</font></a>, exerts himself for this (creed), ceases (to act), is houseless, walks about bald-headed. The naked, fasting (monk), who combats the flesh, will be abused, or struck, or hurt <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_240"><font size="1">2</font></a>; he will be upbraided with his former trade, or reviled with untrue reproaches. Accounting (for this treatment) by his former sins, knowing pleasant and unpleasant occurrences, he should patiently wander about. Quitting all worldliness <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">3</font></a> one should bear all (disagreeable) feelings, being possessed of the right view <a name="fr_245"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">4</font></a>. (2)</p>  
 <p>Those are called naked, who in this world, never returning (to a worldly state), (follow) my religion according to the commandment. This highest doctrine has here been declared for men. Delighted with this, destroying that (i.e. the effect of works), he will successively <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">5</font></a> give up sinfulness <a name="fr_247"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">6</font></a>, after having come to a knowledge of it. Here (in our religion) some live as single mendicants. Therefore a wise man should lead the life of an ascetic by collecting pure alms or any alms in all sorts of families. 'If (the food) be of good or bad smell, or if dreadful beasts inflict pain on (other) beings'--</p>

 <p>all that happens to you, you will firmly bear it. Thus I say. (3)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_240"></a><a href="sbe2231.htm#fr_243">56:2</a> Lûsie. The commentator translates it by lu<i>n</i><i>k</i>ita, to tear out the hair. This would be a rather difficult operation on the bald head of a <i>G</i>aina monk. Lûsiya is, of course, the Sanskrit lûshita, hurt.</p>
