 <p>I shall deliver in due order the Lecture on Lê<i>s</i>yâ; hear the nature of the six Lê<i>s</i>yâs (produced by) Karman. (1)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>Hear 1. the names, 2. colours, 3. tastes, 4. smells, 5. touches, 6. degrees, 7. character, 8. variety, 9. duration, 10. result, and 11. life of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs. (2)</p>  
 <p>1. They are named in the following order: black, blue, grey, red, yellow, and white. (3)</p>  
 <p>2. The black Lê<i>s</i>yâ has the colour of a rain-cloud, a buffalo's horn, (the fruit of) Rish<i>t</i>aka <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or the eye of the wagtail. (4)</p>  
 <p>The blue Lê<i>s</i>yâ has the colour of the blue A<i>s</i>ôka <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the tail of the <i>K</i>asha <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or of lapis lazuli. (5)</p>  
 <p>The grey Lê<i>s</i>yâ has the colour of the flower of Atasî <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the feathers of the Kôkila, or the collar of pigeons. (6)</p>  
 <p>The red Lê<i>s</i>yâ has the colour of vermilion, the rising sun, or the bill of a parrot. (7)</p>  
 <p>The yellow Lê<i>s</i>yâ has the colour of orpiment, turmeric, or the flowers of <i>S</i>a<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">5</font></a> and Asana <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">6</font></a>. (8)</p>  
 <p>The white Lê<i>s</i>yâ has the colour of a conch-shell, the aṅka-stone <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">7</font></a>, Kunda-flowers <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">8</font></a>, flowing milk, silver, or a necklace of pearls. (9)</p>  
 <p>3. The taste of the black Lê<i>s</i>yâ is infinitely more bitter than that of Tumbaka <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">9</font></a>, (the fruit of the) Nimb-tree <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">10</font></a>, or of Rôhi<i>n</i>î. (10)</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>The taste of the blue Lê<i>s</i>yâ is infinitely more pungent than Trika<i>t</i>uka <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">1</font></a> and Hastipippalî. (11)</p>  
 <p>The taste of grey Lê<i>s</i>yâ is infinitely sourer than that of unripe Mango and Kapittha <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (12)</p>  
 <p>The taste of red Lê<i>s</i>yâ is infinitely more pleasant than that of ripe Mango and Kapittha. (13)</p>  
 <p>The taste of yellow Lê<i>s</i>yâ is infinitely better than that of excellent wine and various liquors, honey and Mairêyaka <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (14)</p>  
 <p>The taste of white Lê<i>s</i>yâ is infinitely better than that of dates, grapes, milk, candied and pounded sugar. (15)</p>  
 <p>The smell of the bad Lê<i>s</i>yâs (viz. the three first) is infinitely worse than that of the corpse of a cow, dog, or snake. (16)</p>  
 <p>The smell of the three good Lê<i>s</i>yâs is infinitely more pleasant than that of fragrant flowers and of perfumes when they are pounded. (17)</p>  
 <p>5. The touch of the bad Lê<i>s</i>yâs is infinitely worse than that of a saw, the tongue of a cow, or leaf of the Teak tree. (18)</p>  
 <p>The touch of the three good Lê<i>s</i>yâs is infinitely more pleasant than that of cotton, butter, or <i>S</i>irîsha-flowers <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">4</font></a>. (19)</p>  
 <p>6. The degrees <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs are three, or nine,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p>or twenty-seven, or eighty-one, or two hundred and forty-three. (20)</p>  
 <p>7. A man who acts on the impulse of the five Âsravas <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">1</font></a>, does not possess the three Guptis, has not ceased to injure the six (kinds of living beings), commits cruel acts, is wicked and violent, is afraid of no consequences <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">2</font></a>, is mischievous and does not subdue his senses--a man of such habits develops the black Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (21, 22)</p>  
 <p>A man of the following qualities: envy, anger, want of self-control, ignorance, deceit, want of modesty, greed, hatred, wickedness, carelessness, love of enjoyment; a man who pursues pleasures and does not abstain from sinful undertakings, who is wicked and violent--a man of such habits develops the blue Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (23, 24)</p>  
 <p>A man who is dishonest in words and acts, who is base, not upright, a dissembler and deceiver <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">3</font></a>, a heretic, a vile man, a talker of hurtful and sinful things, a thief, and full of jealousy--a man of such habits develops the grey Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (25, 26)</p>  
 <p>A man who is humble, steadfast, free from deceit and inquisitiveness, well disciplined, restrained, attentive to his study and duties <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who loves the Law and keeps it, who is afraid of forbidden things and strives after the highest good--a man of such habits develops the red Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (27, 28)</p>  
 <p>A man who has but little anger, pride, deceit, and greed, whose mind is at ease, who controls himself,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>who is attentive to his study and duties, who speaks but little, is calm, and subdues his senses--a man of such habits develops the yellow Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (29, 30)</p>  
 <p>A man who abstains from constant thinking about his misery and about sinful deeds, but engages in meditation on the Law and truth only <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">1</font></a>, whose mind is at ease, who controls himself, who practises the Samitis and Guptis, whether he be still subject to passion or free from passion, is calm, and subdues his senses--a man of such habits develops the white Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (31, 32)</p>  
 <p>8. There are as many varieties <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">2</font></a> of Lê<i>s</i>yâs as there are Samayas <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">3</font></a> in the innumerable Avasarpi<i>n</i>îs and Utsarpi<i>n</i>îs, and as there are countless worlds. (33)</p>  
 <p>9. Half a muhûrta is the shortest, and thirty-three Sâgarôpamâs plus one muhûrta is the longest duration of the black Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (34)</p>  
 <p>Half a muhûrta is the shortest, and ten Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya is the longest duration of the blue Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (35)</p>  
 <p>Half a muhûrta is the shortest, and three Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya is the longest duration of the grey Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (36)</p>  
 <p>Half a muhûrta is the shortest, and two Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya is the longest duration of the red Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (37)</p>  
 <p>Half a muhûrta is the shortest, and ten Sâgarôpamâs plus one muhûrta is the longest duration of the yellow Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (38)</p>  
 <p>

 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></a></p>  
 <p>Half a muhûrta is the shortest, and thirty-three Sâgarôpamâs plus one muhûrta is the longest duration of the white Lê<i>s</i>yâ. (39)</p>  
 <p>I have described above the duration of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs generally; I shall now detail their duration in the four walks of mundane existence <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (40)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the grey Lê<i>s</i>yâ (of a denizen of hell) is ten thousand years, the longest three Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya. (41)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the blue Lê<i>s</i>yâ (of a denizen of hell) is three Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya, the longest ten Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya. (42)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the black Lê<i>s</i>yâ (of a denizen of hell) is ten Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya, the longest thirty-three Sâgarôpamâs. (43)</p>  
 <p>I have described the duration of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs of denizens of hell; I shall now describe that of animals, men, and gods. (44)</p>  
 <p>The duration of any of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs except the best (viz. white one) is less than a muhûrta for (the lowest organisms), animals, and men <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (45)</p>  
 <p>Half a muhûrta is the shortest duration of the white Lê<i>s</i>yâ (of animals and men), and the longest a Krore of former years <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">3</font></a> less nine years. (46)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>I have described the duration of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs of animals and men, I shall now describe that of the gods. (47)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the black Lê<i>s</i>yâ is ten thousand years, the longest a Palyôpamâ and (a part of) an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya. (48)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the blue Lê<i>s</i>yâ is equal to the longest of the black one plus one Samaya; the longest is one Palyôpamâ plus a (greater part of) an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya. (49)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the grey Lê<i>s</i>yâ is equal to the longest of the blue one plus one Samaya; the longest is one Palyôpamâ plus (a still greater part of) an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya. (50)</p>  
 <p>I shall now describe the red Lê<i>s</i>yâ as it is with gods, Bhavanapatis, Vyantaras, <i>G</i>yôtishkas, and Vaimânikas. (51)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the red Lê<i>s</i>yâ is one Palyôpamâ, the longest two Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (52)</p>  
 <p>The shortest duration of the red Lê<i>s</i>yâ is ten thousand years, the longest two Sâgarôpamâs plus one Palyôpamâ and a part of an Asa<i>m</i>khyêya. (53)</p>  
 <p>The longest duration of the red Lê<i>s</i>yâ plus one Samaya is equal to the shortest of the yellow Lê<i>s</i>yâ; its longest, however, is ten muhûrtas longer. (54)</p>  
 <p>The longest duration of the yellow Lê<i>s</i>yâ plus one Samaya is equal to the shortest of the white Lê<i>s</i>yâ; the longest, however, is thirty-three muhûrtas longer. (55)</p>  
 <p>10. The black, blue, and grey Lê<i>s</i>yâs are the</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>lowest Lê<i>s</i>yâs; through them the soul is brought into miserable courses of life. (56)</p>  
 <p>The red, yellow, and white Lê<i>s</i>yâs are the good Lê<i>s</i>yâs; through them the soul is brought into happy courses of life. (57)</p>  
 <p>11. In the first moment of these Lê<i>s</i>yâs when they are joined (with the soul), the latter is not born into a new existence <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (58)</p>  
 <p>In the last moment of all these Lê<i>s</i>yâs when they are joined (with the soul), the latter is not born into a new existence. (59)</p>  
 <p>While the last muhûrta is running and a part of it is still to come, the souls with their Lê<i>s</i>yâs developed, go to a new birth. (60)</p>  
 <p>A wise man should, therefore, know the nature of these Lê<i>s</i>yâs; he should avoid the bad ones and obtain the good ones. (61)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_548"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_551">196:2</a> The lê<i>s</i>yâs (adhyavasâya vi<i>s</i>êshâ<i>h</i>) are different conditions produced in the soul by the influence of different Karman; they are therefore not dependent on the nature of the soul, but on the Karman which accompanies the soul, and are, as it were, the reflection of the Karman on the soul, as stated in the following verse from the Ava<i>k</i>ûri: k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>âdidravyasâ<i>k</i>ivyât pari<i>n</i>âmô ya âtmana<i>h</i> | spa<i>t</i>ikasyêva tatrâya<i>m</i> lê<i>s</i>yâ<i>s</i>abda<i>h</i> pravartate || The alteration produced on the soul, just as on a crystal by the presence of black things, &amp;c., is denoted by the word lê<i>s</i>yâ.' The Lê<i>s</i>yâ, or, according to the above explanation, what produces Lê<i>s</i>yâ, is a subtile substance accompanying the soul; to it are attributed the qualities described in this lecture.--The word lêsâ is derived from klê<i>s</i>a; this etymology appears rather fanciful, but I think it may be right. For the Lê<i>s</i>yâs seem to be the Klê<i>s</i>as, which affect the soul, conceived as a kind of substance. The Sanskrit term Lê<i>s</i>yâ is of course a hybrid word. It must, however, be stated that lêsâ occurs also in the meaning 'colour,' e.g. Sûtrak<i>ri</i>t. I, 6, 13, and that the Prâk<i>ri</i>t of klêsa is kilê<i>s</i>a.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_552"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_555">197:4</a> Linum Usitatissimum, whose flowers are blue.--The word for grey is kâû = kâpôta; in the comm., however, it is described as ki<i>m</i><i>k</i>it k<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>â, ki<i>m</i><i>k</i>il lôhitâ, which would be rather brown. But the description given in our verse leaves no doubt that grey colour is intended.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_565">198:4</a> Acacia Sirisa.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_566">198:5</a> The Lê<i>s</i>yâs may possess their qualities in a low, middle, or high degree; each of these degrees is again threefold, viz. low, middle, and high. In this way the subdivision is carried on up to 243.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_567">199:1</a> I.e. commits the five great sins.--The following verses give the character--laksha<i>n</i>a--of the Lê<i>s</i>yâs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_565"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_568">199:2</a> This is, according to the comm., the meaning of the word niddha<i>m</i>dhasapari<i>n</i>âmô.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_571">200:1</a> Literally: who avoids the ârta and raudra dhyânas, and practises the dharma and <i>s</i>ukla dhyânas. These terms cannot be adequately translated; the reader may therefore be referred for details to Bhandarkar's Report, p. 110 ff.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_569"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_572">200:2</a> <i>Th</i>â<i>n</i>âi<i>m</i> sthânâni.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_574">201:1</a> Viz. as denizens of hell, brutes, men, and gods. Only the three first Lê<i>s</i>yâs lead to being born in hell.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_575">201:2</a> The consequence of this statement appears to be that at the expiration of the Lê<i>s</i>yâ a new one is produced. The commentators, however, are not explicit on this head.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_576">201:3</a> About the former years, see above, <a href="sbe4505.htm#page_16">p. 16</a>, note <a href="sbe4505.htm#fn_88">1</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_577">202:1</a> This verse seems to lay down the duration of the Lê<i>s</i>yâ in the case of common gods, while the next one applies to Bhavanapatis, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="sbe4536.htm#fr_578">203:1</a> The question treated rather darkly in the next three verses is, according to the comm., the following:--Every individual dies in the same Lê<i>s</i>yâ in which he is born. When his Lê<i>s</i>yâ ends with his life, then the soul must get a new Lê<i>s</i>yâ. Our verses state at which time the new Lê<i>s</i>yâ comes into existence or is joined with the soul.</p>
