 <p>O long-lived (<i>G</i>ambûsvâmin)! I (Sudharman) have heard the following Discourse from the Venerable (Mahâvîra). We now come to the Lecture called 'on Activity.' The contents of it are as follows:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="green">p. 356</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> It treats, briefly, of two subjects: merit and demerit.</p>  
 <p>(The former is when the Self is) at rest, (the latter, when it is) in disturbance <a name="fr_1034"></a><a href="#fn_1026"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (1)</p>  
 <p>Now the explanation <a name="fr_1035"></a><a href="#fn_1027"><font size="1">2</font></a> of the first subject, viz. demerit, is as follows. Here in the East, West, North, and South, (&amp;c., all as in II, I, 12, down to) ugly men. (2)</p>  
 <p>And as regards committing of sin <a name="fr_1036"></a><a href="#fn_1028"><font size="1">3</font></a>, among denizens of hell, brute animals, gods, men, and whatever other suchlike beings there be, the sentient beings feel <a name="fr_1037"></a><a href="#fn_1029"><font size="1">4</font></a> the pain. (3)</p>  
 <p>And these beings practise the following thirteen kinds of activity--</p>  
 <p>1. sinning for one's interest;</p>  
 <p>2. sinning without a personal interest;</p>  
 <p>3. sinning by slaying;</p>  
 <p>4. sinning through accident;</p>  
 <p>5. sinning by an error of sight;</p>  
 <p>6. sinning by lying;</p>  
 <p>7. sinning by taking what is not freely given;</p>  
 <p>8. sinning by a mere conceit;</p>  
 <p>9. sinning through pride;</p>  
 <p>10. sinning through bad treatment of one's friends;</p>  
 <p>11. sinning through deceit;</p>  
 <p>12. sinning through greed;</p>  
 <p>13. actions referring to a religious life. (4)</p>

 <p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></a></p>  
 <p>1. The first kind of committing sins is that prompted by a motive. This is the case when a man for his own sake, for the sake of his relations, his house, his family, his friends, for the sake of Nâgas, Bhûtas, or Yakshas does injury to movable or immovable beings, or has it done by another person, or consents to another's doing it. Thereby the, bad Karman accrues to him. This is the first kind of committing sins, that prompted by a motive. (5)</p>  
 <p>2. We now treat of the second kind of committing sins, viz. that which is not prompted by personal interest. This is the case when a man slays, kills, cuts, pierces, hacks, mangles, or puts to death movable living beings, not because he wants their body, skin, flesh, blood, heart, bile, feathers of their tail, tail, big or small horns, teeth, tusks, nails, sinews, bones, or marrow; nor because he has been wounded by them, or is wounded, or will be wounded; nor in order to support his children, or to feed his cattle, or to enlarge his houses, nor for the maintenance of <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, nor for the benefit of his body; setting aside reason a fool acquires the habit of cruelty, being a wanton killer. (6)</p>  
 <p>This is the case when a man slays, &amp;c. (see above) immovable living beings as Ikka<i>t</i>a-reed, Ka<i>th</i>ina, <i>G</i>antuka-grass, Para-grass <a name="fr_1038"></a><a href="#fn_1030"><font size="1">1</font></a>, Môksha-trees <a name="fr_1039"></a><a href="#fn_1031"><font size="1">2</font></a>, grass, Ku<i>s</i>a-grass, Ku<i>k</i><i>kh</i>aka <a name="fr_1040"></a><a href="#fn_1032"><font size="1">3</font></a>, Pappaka <a name="fr_1041"></a><a href="#fn_1033"><font size="1">4</font></a>, or straw, not</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="green">p. 358</font></a></p>  
 <p>in order to support his children, (&amp;c., all down to) wanton killer. (7)</p>  
 <p>Or when a man on a marsh, a lake, a sheet of water, a pasture-ground, a place surrounded by a ditch, a moat, a thicket, stronghold <a name="fr_1042"></a><a href="#fn_1034"><font size="1">1</font></a> in a thicket, forest, stronghold in a forest, [mountain, stronghold on a mountain <a name="fr_1043"></a><a href="#fn_1035"><font size="1">2</font></a>], piles up grass and lights a fire, or has it lighted by another person, or consents to another's lighting it. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the second kind of committing sins, that prompted by no personal interest. (8)</p>  
 <p>3. We now treat of the third kind of committing sins, called slaying. This is the case when a man thinking that some one has hurt, hurts, or will hurt him, or one of his people, or somebody else, or one of that person's people, kills movable and immovable beings, has them killed by another person, or consents to another's killing them. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the third kind of committing sins, called slaying. (9)</p>  
 <p>4. We now treat of the fourth kind of committing sins, called accidental <a name="fr_1044"></a><a href="#fn_1036"><font size="1">3</font></a>. This is the case when in marshes (&amp;c., all as above, down to) strongholds in</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="green">p. 359</font></a></p>  
 <p>a forest, a man who lives on deer, who likes deer, who dotes on deer, goes a hunting deer. Fancying to see deer, he takes aim with his arrow to kill the deer. Thinking that he will kill the deer, he kills a partridge, or a duck, or a quail, or a pigeon, or a monkey, or a francoline partridge. Here instead of one (being) he hurts another, (therefore he is called) an accidental killer. (10)</p>  
 <p>This is the case when a man weeding rice, Kôdrava <a name="fr_1045"></a><a href="#fn_1037"><font size="1">1</font></a>, panic seed, Paraka, or Râlaka, uses his knife to cut some weeds. Fancying that he is cutting some weed-grasses <a name="fr_1046"></a><a href="#fn_1038"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he cuts rice (&amp;c., down to) Râlaka. Here instead of one (plant) he hurts another; (therefore he is called) an accidental killer. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the fourth kind of committing sins, called accidental. (11)</p>  
 <p>5. We now treat of the fifth kind of committing sins, viz. by an error of sight. This is the case when a man living together with his mother, father, brothers, sisters, wives, sons, daughters, or daughters-in-law, and mistaking a friend for an enemy, kills the friend by mistake. (12)</p>  
 <p>This is the case when during a riot in a village <a name="fr_1047"></a><a href="#fn_1039"><font size="1">3</font></a>,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="green">p. 360</font></a></p>  
 <p>or a scot-free town, or a town with an earth wall, or a poor town, or an isolated town, or a large town, or a sea-town, or a mine, or a hermitage, or a halting-place of processions or caravans, or a capital, a man mistaking for a robber one who is not, kills him by mistake. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the fifth kind of committing sins, viz. by an error of sight. (13)</p>  
 <p>6. We now treat of the sixth kind of committing sins, viz. by lying. This is the case when a man for his own sake, or for the sake of his relations, his house, or his servants tells lies, causes another person to tell lies, or consents to another's telling lies. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the sixth kind of committing sins, viz. by lying. (14)</p>  
 <p>7. Now we treat of the seventh kind of committing sins, viz. by taking what is not freely given. This is the case when a man for his own sake (&amp;c., as above) takes himself what is not freely given, has it taken by another person, or consents to another's taking it. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the seventh kind of committing sins, viz. by taking what is not freely given. (15)</p>  
 <p>8. Now we treat of the eighth kind of committing sins, viz. by a mere conceit. This is the case when a man, without being disappointed by anybody in any way, meditates, melancholy, sorry, angry, downcast, anxious in thoughts and ideas, plunged in a sea of sorrow and misery, reposing his head on the palm of his hand, overcome by painful reflections, and casting his eyes on the ground <a name="fr_1048"></a><a href="#fn_1040"><font size="1">1</font></a>. There are four</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 361</font></a></p>  
 <p>mental, but real, conditions (of this kind), viz. wrath, pride, deceit, and greed; for wrath, pride, deceit, and greed are mental conditions. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the eighth kind of committing sins, viz. by a mere conceit. (16)</p>  
 <p>9. Now we treat of the ninth kind of committing sins, viz. through pride. This is the case when a man drunk (as it were) with pride of caste, family, beauty, piety, knowledge, success, power, intelligence <a name="fr_1049"></a><a href="#fn_1041"><font size="1">1</font></a>, or any other kind of pride, slights, blames, abuses, reviles, despises somebody else and extols himself, (thinking:) 'he is my inferior, I am of better caste or family, and possess greater power and other advantages.' When he leaves this body and is only accompanied by his Karman, he, without a will of his own, goes forth from womb to womb, from birth to birth, from death to death, from hell to hell. He is cruel, stubborn, fickle, and proud. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the ninth kind of committing sins, viz. through pride. (17)</p>  
 <p>10. We now treat of the tenth kind of committing sins, consisting in bad treatment of one's friends. This is the case when a man living together with his mother, father, brothers, sisters, wives, sons, daughters, or daughters-in-law, severely punishes even the smallest offence of theirs; e.g. he ducks the offender <a name="fr_1050"></a><a href="#fn_1042"><font size="1">2</font></a> in cold water, or pours hot water over him, or scalds him with fire, or lashes his sides sore with a halter, reed, rope <a name="fr_1051"></a><a href="#fn_1043"><font size="1">3</font></a>, strap of leather, whip, or</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="green">p. 362</font></a></p>  
 <p>thong of a whip, or he beats the offender with a stick, bone, fist, clod, or potsherd. When such a man is at home, (his people) are miserable; but when he is abroad, they rejoice. Such a man, who is for ever punishing, severely punishing, is hateful in this world and the next, irritable, passionate, an extortioner <a name="fr_1052"></a><a href="#fn_1044"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the tenth kind of committing sins, consisting in bad treatment of one's friends. (18)</p>  
 <p>11. We now treat of the eleventh kind of committing sins, viz. through deceit. Those who conceal their thoughts, who are shrouded in darkness, who are light as the feather of an owl or heavy like a mountain, use unworthy <a name="fr_1053"></a><a href="#fn_1045"><font size="1">2</font></a> speech though they be Âryas. They believe themselves different from what they really are; asked one thing, they answer another, they speak different from what is to be spoken. (19)</p>  
 <p>As a man in whose body sticks an arrow <a name="fr_1054"></a><a href="#fn_1046"><font size="1">3</font></a>, does not extricate it (fearing the pain), nor has it extricated by somebody else, nor destroys it, but hides it; and the arrow, being not removed, goes deeper and deeper (in the flesh); so a deceitful man, having practised deception, does not confess it, expiate it, blame the deed to himself or others, does not remove it, annihilate it, and endeavour not to do it again, does not practise the prescribed austerities and penance. A deceitful man is generally not trusted <a name="fr_1055"></a><a href="#fn_1047"><font size="1">4</font></a> in this world, a deceitful man is not trusted in the next world. He blames and reviles (the person</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="green">p. 363</font></a></p>  
 <p>whom he has deceived), he praises himself, and rejoices, and does not desist (from his vile practices); he conceals the wrong he has done to others, and does not acquire a pure Lê<i>s</i>yâ. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the eleventh kind of committing sins, viz. through deceit. (20)</p>  
 <p>12. We now treat of the twelfth kind of committing sins, viz. through greed. Those (heretical monks) who live in woods, in huts, about villages, or practise some secret rites, are not well controlled, nor do they well abstain (from slaying) all sorts of living beings. They employ speech that is true and untrue at the same time <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1048"><font size="1">1</font></a>: 'do not beat me, beat others; do not abuse me, abuse others; do not capture me, capture others; do not torment me, torment others; do not deprive me of life, deprive others of life <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1049"><font size="1">2</font></a>.' And thus they are given to sensual pleasures, desire them, are held captive by them, passionately love them for four or five years, for six or ten years--(the period) may be shorter or longer. After having enjoyed these pleasures, and having died at their allotted time, they will be born in some places inhabited by Asuras and evildoers. And when they are released therefrom, they will be born deaf and dumb, or blind <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1050"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or dumb by birth. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him. This is the twelfth kind of committing sins, viz. through greed. (21)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="green">p. 364</font></a></p>  
 <p>These twelve kinds of committing sins should be well understood by a pious <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a or Brâhma<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_1059"></a><a href="#fn_1051"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (22)</p>  
 <p>13. We now treat of the thirteenth kind of acquiring Karman, that having reference to religious life <a name="fr_1060"></a><a href="#fn_1052"><font size="1">2</font></a>. A monk <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1053"><font size="1">3</font></a> who controls himself for the benefit of his soul, who in walking carefully avoids to cause the death of any living creature <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1054"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who uses gentle and righteous speech <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1055"><font size="1">5</font></a>, who receives alms in a manner to avoid the forty-two faults <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">6</font></a>, who is careful in receiving and keeping of things necessary for religious exercises <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">7</font></a>, who performs the operations of nature (excrements, urine, saliva, corporal impurities and mucus) in an unfrequented place <a name="fr_1066"></a><a href="#fn_1058"><font size="1">8</font></a>, who is careful with regard to mind, speech, and body <a name="fr_1067"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">9</font></a>, who guards his mind, speech, and body so as to protect his soul from passions <a name="fr_1068"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">10</font></a>, who guards his senses, who leads a chaste life regulated by the three Guptis, who carefully walks, stands, sits down, lies down, and speaks, who carefully takes up and lays</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>

 <p>

 <p>down his cloth, alms-bowl, blanket, broom,--(even) such a monk performs various subtile actions called îryapathika (if it did but consist in moving an eyelash). This Karman is acquired and comes in contact (with the soul) in the first moment, in the second moment it is experienced, in the third it is destroyed; thus it is acquired, comes in contact (with the soul), takes rise, and is destroyed. For all time to come (the person in question) is exempt from Karman <a name="fr_1069"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">1</font></a>. Thereby the bad Karman accrues to him <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1062"><font size="1">2</font></a>. This is the thirteenth kind of acquiring Karman, that inseparable from a religious life. (23)</p>  
 <p>All the Arhats and Bhagavats of the past, present, and future have told, tell, and will tell, have declared, declare, and will declare the above thirteen kinds of acquiring Karman. They have practised, practise, and will practise the thirteenth kind of acquiring Karman. (24)</p>  
 <p>As a supplement <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1063"><font size="1">3</font></a> to the above (discussion) will</p>

 <p><a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="green">p. 366</font></a></p>  
 <p>now be told the subject of men's success by occult sciences. Some men differing in intellect, will, character, opinions, taste, undertakings, and plans, study various evil sciences; (25) viz. (the divination) from terrestrial accidents, from strange phenomena <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1064"><font size="1">1</font></a>, from dreams, from phenomena in the air, from changes in the body, from sounds, from mystical signs <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1065"><font size="1">2</font></a>, from seeds <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1066"><font size="1">3</font></a>; (the interpretation of the) marks of women, men, elephants, cows, partridges, cocks, ducks, quails, of wheels, parasols, shields, sticks, swords, precious stones, jewels <a name="fr_1075"></a><a href="#fn_1067"><font size="1">4</font></a>; (26) the art to make one happy or miserable, to make a woman pregnant, to deprive one of his wits; incantations <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1068"><font size="1">5</font></a>, conjuring <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1069"><font size="1">6</font></a>; oblations of substances; the martial arts; the course of the moon, sun, Venus, and Jupiter; the falling of meteors; great conflagration; divination from wild animals <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1070"><font size="1">7</font></a>, the flight of crows, showers of dust, rain of blood, the Vaitâlî and Ardhavaitâlî arts <a name="fr_1079"></a><a href="#fn_1071"><font size="1">8</font></a>, the art of casting people asleep, of opening doors, the art of <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âlas, of <i>S</i>abaras, of Dravi<i>d</i>as, of Kaliṅgas, of Gau<i>d</i>as, of Gândhâras; the spells for making somebody fall down, rise, yawn; for making him immovable, or cling to something; for making him sick, or sound;</p>

 <p>for making somebody go forth, disappear, (or come) <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">1</font></a>. These and similar sciences are practised (by some men) for the sake of food, drink, clothes, a lodging, a bed, and various objects of pleasure. They practise a wrong science, the unworthy, the mistaken <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">2</font></a> men. After having died at their allotted time, they will be born in some places inhabited by Asuras and evildoers. And when they are released therefrom, they will again be born deaf and dumb, or night-blind. (27)</p>  
 <p>Some man for his own sake or for the sake of his relations, family, or servants, or entering the service of an acquaintance or neighbour of his, becomes his companion or his helpmate, or he goes to meet him, or he becomes a burglar, or a cut-purse, or he tends sheep, or he becomes a hunter <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">3</font></a>, or he catches birds, or he uses nets (for catching deer), or he becomes a fisherman or a cowherd or a slayer of cows or a dog-keeper or he hunts with dogs. (28)</p>  
 <p>A man, becoming the companion of another man, will follow him everywhere, (and having inspired him with confidence) beats, cuts, pierces; tears, thrashes, or puts him to death, and thereby gets his food. By these very evil deeds he degrades himself <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">4</font></a>. (29)</p>  
 <p>A man, becoming the helpmate of another man, always attends on him, (and having inspired him with confidence) beats, &amp;c. (all down to) degrades himself. (30)</p>

 <p>A man, going to meet somebody, on the road, beats, &amp;c. (all down to) degrades himself. (3 I)</p>  
 <p>A man, becoming a burglar, breaks into a house and beats, &amp;c. (all down to) degrades himself. (32)</p>  
 <p>A man, becoming a cut-purse, cuts the purse and beats, &amp;c. (all down to) degrades himself. (33)</p>  
 <p>A man, becoming a tender of sheep, beats, cuts, pierces, tears, thrashes, or puts to death a ram or some other animal. (The rest as above.) (34)</p>  
 <p>A man, becoming a hunter, beats, &amp;c. (all down to) puts to death a buffalo or some other animal. (The rest as above.) (35)</p>  
 <p>A man, using nets (for catching deer), beats, &amp;c., an antelope or some other animal. (The rest as above.) (36)</p>

 <p>deeds, they enjoy the excellent pleasures of human life; viz. such a man eats at dinner-time, he drinks at drinking-time, he dresses himself at dressing-time, he goes to bed at the proper time, and sleeps at sleeping-time. Doing everything in its turn, he bathes, makes the offering (to the house-gods) <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">1</font></a>, performs auspicious rites and expiatory acts, washes his head, hangs a wreath round his neck, adorns himself with precious stones and golden (trinkets), puts on (his head) a chaplet of flowers; with his body strengthened, with a wreath hanging down to the girdle of his loins, dressed in new clothes, his limbs and body anointed with sandal, (sitting) on a large throne in a lofty upper room (of his house), surrounded by women and a troop of followers, in the light (of torches) burning the whole night, under the great din of uninterrupted storytelling, dramatical plays, singing, and music, as beating of time, performing on the Vî<i>n</i>â, Tûryâ, the great drum, and Pa<i>t</i>upa<i>t</i>aha <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">2</font></a>, he enjoys the excellent pleasures of human life.

 <p>(The conduct described in the preceding) part <a name="fr_1090"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">2</font></a> is agreeable to some (heretical) monks, to some householders, to men governed by love of life.

They purify themselves by practising the <i>S</i>ilavratas and Gu<i>n</i>avratas <a name="fr_1127"></a><a href="#fn_1119"><font size="1">4</font></a>, the Virama<i>n</i>a, the Pratyâkhyâna,</p>

 <p>Living in this way they are for many years followers of the <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as, and if then they fall sick, or even if they do not, they refuse food and omit many meals by abstaining from food.

 <p align="center">_______________________</p>  
 <p>Those whom we have been treating of, fall under the two heads: merit and demerit; (the former is when the Self is) at rest, (the latter, when it is) in disturbance.</p>  
 <p>Now the explanation of the first subject is as follows:</p>  
 <p>There are enumerated three hundred and sixty-three philosophical schools <a name="fr_1131"></a><a href="#fn_1123"><font size="1">1</font></a>: those of the Kriyâvâda, those of the Akriyâvâda, those of the A<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânikavâda, and those of the Vainayikavâda. These (philosophers) teach final beatitude, they teach final deliverance, they speak as <i>S</i>râvakas, they speak as teachers of <i>S</i>râvakas <a name="fr_1132"></a><a href="#fn_1124"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (79)</p>  
 <p>All these philosophers, founders of systems of their own, differing in intellect, will, character, opinions, taste, undertakings, and plans, formed one large circle, and every one of them stood in his place.</p>  
 <p>One man took hold of a vessel quite full of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="green">p. 386</font></a></p>  
 <p>burning coals by an iron pair of tongs, and addressed those philosophers, founders of systems of their own, differing in intellect, (&amp;c., all down to) undertakings and plans, in the following way: 'Heighho! ye philosophers, (&amp;c., all down to) undertakings and plans! take this vessel full of burning coals and hold it for a minute in your hands! But do not take hold of it by a pair of tongs, nor put out the fire, nor come to the help of one of your own creed or of an alien creed (by putting out the fire, &amp;c.); but fair and honest <a name="fr_1133"></a><a href="#fn_1125"><font size="1">1</font></a>, without using any trick, stretch out your hands.' Having thus spoken, the man took hold of the vessel quite full of burning coals by an iron pair of tongs, and (offered to) put it in the hands of those philosophers. But the philosophers, (&amp;c., all down to) undertakings and plans, held back their hands. On this the man addressed all the philosophers, (&amp;c., all down to) undertakings and plans, in the following way: 'Heighho, ye philosophers, (&amp;c., all down to) undertakings and plans! why do you hold back your hands?' 'Our hand will be burned.' 'What then, if it is burned?' '(We shall suffer) pain.' 'Because you are afraid of pain, you hold back your hands!' (So are all creatures averse to pain). This is a maxim of general application <a name="fr_1134"></a><a href="#fn_1126"><font size="1">2</font></a>, it is a true principle, a religious reflection <a name="fr_1135"></a><a href="#fn_1127"><font size="1">3</font></a>; this maxim, this principle, this religious reflection holds good with regard to every (living being). Therefore those <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as who say that all sorts of living beings may be beaten or treated with violence or abused or tormented</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_387"><font size="1" color="green">p. 387</font></a></p>  
 <p>or deprived of life, will in the time to come <a name="fr_1136"></a><a href="#fn_1128"><font size="1">1</font></a> suffer cutting or piercing, will experience birth, old age, death, conception in the womb, the Circle of Births, regeneration, existence as a foetus, the whole scale of mundane existences, and suffer a variety of pains <a name="fr_1137"></a><a href="#fn_1129"><font size="1">2</font></a>, (80)</p>  
 <p>They will many times undergo punishment, pulling out of the hair, threatening, putting in irons, (&amp;c., similar as in § 63, all down to) whirling round; (they will witness) the death of their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law; (they will experience) poverty, bad luck, company of hated people, separation from those whom they love, misery, and despair; they will again and again wander about in the beginningless and endless, immense wilderness of the fourfold Sa<i>m</i>sâra. They will not reach perfection, (&amp;c., all down to) not put an end to all misery.--This is a maxim of general application, (&amp;c., all down to) holds good with regard to every (living being). (81)</p>  
 <p>But those <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as who say that all sorts of living beings should not be beaten, &amp;c., will in the time to come not suffer cutting, &amp;c. They will not undergo many punishments, (&amp;c., all just the reverse of what has been said in §§ 80, 81, down to) put an end to all misery. (82)</p>  
 <p align="center">_______________________</p>  
 <p>Thus those beings who practise the first twelve kinds of actions <a name="fr_1138"></a><a href="#fn_1130"><font size="1">3</font></a>, have not attained perfection, (&amp;c., all down to) have not, nor do, nor will put an end to all misery. (83)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_388"><font size="1" color="green">p. 388</font></a></p>  
 <p>But those beings who practise the thirteenth kind of action, have attained perfection, (&amp;c., all down to) have put, or put, or will put an end to all misery. (84)</p>  
 <p>Thus a monk who obtains his soul's good and benefit, who guards himself, who (well directs the functions) of his soul, who well exerts himself, who protects himself (from evil), who is careful of himself, who saves himself (from the Sa<i>m</i>sâra), should withhold his soul (from the twelve kinds of committing sins). (85)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

After the supplement §§ 25-27 a separate treatise on the main subject is inserted §§ 28-60 (28-57 on demerit, 58-59 on merit, § 60 on a mixed state); after this follows a similar treatise in §§ 61-77 (61-68 on demerit, 69-74 on merit, 75-77 on a mixed state). In § 78 we have again a supplement, and §§ 79-82 contain another supplement (or perhaps two). §§ 83-85 give the conclusion of the first treatise (§§ 1-24) and must originally have followed immediately after § 24.

I therefore comment upon the text exhibited in one MS. If, therefore, my text does not agree with that (of the reader) he should not be alarmed.' All the MSS. I use have the same text, that of the commentator. It is characteristic of the way in which Harshakula, the author of the Dîpikâ, worked, that he copies <i>S</i>îlâṅka's above remark with some verbal alterations.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1116"></a><a href="sbe4566.htm#fr_1124">383:1</a> Here the commentator inserts the following story: In Râ<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha lived a friar versed in magic arts; he carried off every woman he saw. On the citizens complaining about the rape, the king resolved to find out and punish the man. Catching sight of him at last on the fifth day, the king went after him till the friar disappeared in a hollow tree of the park, which led to an underground room. There the king followed and killed him. He released all the women whom the friar had captured. But one of them would not return to her husband, being desperately smitten with love for her seducer. On the advice of some wise men she was made to drink the friar's (pounded) bones mixed up with milk. This took the spell off her and cured her of her strange passion.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1123"></a><a href="sbe4566.htm#fr_1131">385:1</a> According to the commentators there are 180 schools of Kriyâvâdins, 84 of Akriyâvâdins, 67 of A<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânikavâdins, and 32 of Vainayikavâdins. These numbers are arrived at by calculation, not by actual observation. E.g. the 180 possible schools of the Kriyâvâdins are calculated in the following way. The nine categories of the <i>G</i>ainas are: <i>g</i>îva, a<i>g</i>îva, âsrava, sa<i>m</i>vara, nir<i>g</i>arâ, pu<i>n</i>ya, pâpa, bandha, and môksha. Each of them may be regarded as svata<i>h</i> and parata<i>h</i>, as nitya and anitya with regard to kâla, î<i>s</i>vara, âtma, niyati, and svabhâva. By multiplying 9 successively in 2, 2, 5, we find 180 to be the number of possible schools of Kriyâvâdins.</p>
