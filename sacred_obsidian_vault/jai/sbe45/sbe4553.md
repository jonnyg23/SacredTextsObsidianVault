 <p>I shall now truly tell you another kind of perpetual suffering, how the sinners who have committed crimes suffer for the deeds they have done in their former lives. (1)</p>  
 <p>Tying their hands and feet the (punishers) cut open their belly with razors and knives; taking hold of the mangled body of the sinner, they forcibly tear the skin off his back. (2)</p>  
 <p>They cut off his arms at the armpits; they force his mouth wide open and scald it; they yoke the sinner to a car and drive him, and growing angry <a name="fr_840"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">1</font></a> they pierce his back with a goad. (3)</p>  
 <p>The (sinners) walk over ground burning and glowing like red-hot iron; scorched they shriek horribly, being urged on with arrows <a name="fr_841"></a><a href="#fn_835"><font size="1">2</font></a> and put to a red-hot yoke. (4)</p>  
 <p>The sinners are driven over slippery ground which is like a road of red-hot iron; in this dreadful place (the ministers of hell) make them go forward like slaves (beating them) with sticks. (5)</p>  
 <p>Proceeding in this intolerable (hell) they are crushed by rocks tumbling down. There is the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (caldron) Santâpanî <a name="fr_842"></a><a href="#fn_836"><font size="1">1</font></a>, where evildoers suffer for a long time. (6)</p>  
 <p>They throw the sinners into caldrons and boil them; scalded they rise thence again; devilish crows <a name="fr_843"></a><a href="#fn_837"><font size="1">2</font></a> feed on them and (so do) other beasts having claws devour them. (7)</p>  
 <p>There is a place of smokeless fire in the form of a pile <a name="fr_844"></a><a href="#fn_838"><font size="1">3</font></a> where (the sinners) greatly distressed shriek horribly; head downwards they are lacerated and cut into pieces with iron knives. (8)</p>  
 <p>Tied up and skinned they are devoured by steel-nebbed birds; it is the hell called Sa<i>m</i><i>g</i>îvanî, where life is long, and where men of an evil mind are tortured. (9)</p>  
 <p>The (punishers) pierce them with sharp pikes as people do with a captured pig. Transfixed by a pike the (sinners) shriek horribly; suffering both (bodily and mentally) they feel nothing but pains. (10)</p>  
 <p>There is a great place always on fire, where fires burn without fuel; there for a long time stay the evildoers shrieking aloud. (11)</p>  
 <p>Setting on fire large piles, they thrust into them (a sinner) who will cry horribly; as butter thrown in the fire melts, so does the evildoer there. (12)</p>  
 <p>And there is an always crowded, hot place which one deserves for one's great sins, and which is full of misery. There (the punishers) tie (the sinner's)</p>

 <p>hands and feet, and belabour him with sticks like an enemy. (13)</p>  
 <p>They break the sinner's back with a weapon, and smash his skull with iron clubs; their bodies are split and sawn like a plank; and tortured with red-hot awls (the sinners) are subjected (to cruelties). (14)</p>  
 <p>Cruel evildoers <a name="fr_845"></a><a href="#fn_839"><font size="1">1</font></a>, urged on with arrows, and put to work (by the punishers), carry burdens in the way of elephants; two or three (punishers) get on one (victim) and growing angry <a name="fr_846"></a><a href="#fn_840"><font size="1">2</font></a> hurt his vital parts. (15)</p>  
 <p>The sinners are driven over the large, slippery, and thorny ground; tightly bound with straps <a name="fr_847"></a><a href="#fn_841"><font size="1">3</font></a> they lose their senses; the revenging (punishers) cut them into pieces <a name="fr_848"></a><a href="#fn_842"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and throw them about like a bali-sacrifice. (16)</p>  
 <p>There is a dreadful mountain towering high up in the air, called Vaitâlika <a name="fr_849"></a><a href="#fn_843"><font size="1">5</font></a>, where the evildoers are tortured for more than a thousand hours. (17)</p>  
 <p>Tortured, the sinners shriek, suffering day and night; in this horrid, great hell, which is full of implements of torture, they are put to a cruel death. (18)</p>  
 <p>Full of wrath, like their enemies in a former life,</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="green">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (the punishers) crush them with hammers and clubs. With mangled bodies, and vomiting blood, they fall to the ground, head foremost. (19)</p>  
 <p>There are the ever hungry <a name="fr_850"></a><a href="#fn_844"><font size="1">1</font></a>, savage, always wrathful, great jackals by whom the evildoers bound with shackles are devoured. (20)</p>  
 <p>There is the dreadful, slimy river, which is always flowing and full of molten iron; in this very dreadful river (the sinners) must descend one by one <a name="fr_851"></a><a href="#fn_845"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (21)</p>  
 <p>These pains are suffered without interruption by the sinner who stays there for a long time. There is no escape from the torture; he must, himself and alone, suffer the pains. (22)</p>  
 <p>Whatever cruelty he has done in a former birth, the same will be inflicted on him in the Circle of Births. Having been born in an extremely miserable state of life, the sufferer experiences infinite pain. (23)</p>  
 <p>A wise man hearing of these hells should not kill any living being in the whole world; believing in true doctrines and renouncing all property he should know the world, but not become a slave to it. (24)</p>  
 <p>Knowing the endless Circle of Births <a name="fr_852"></a><a href="#fn_846"><font size="1">3</font></a> with regard to animals, men, and gods, and the reward they will get; knowing all this, (a wise man) should wait for his decease, practising meanwhile self-control. (25)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_834"></a><a href="sbe4553.htm#fr_840">283:1</a> Ârussa = ârushya, here and in a similar passage (verse 15) the commentators explain it, 'making him angry, exasperating him.' They have misunderstood raha<i>m</i>si in the second line, rendering it rahasi; it is of course = rathê.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_835"></a><a href="sbe4553.htm#fr_841">283:2</a> Usu = ishu, explained by âravi<i>s</i>êsha a kind of awl.'</p>

 <p><a name="fn_837"></a><a href="sbe4553.htm#fr_843">284:2</a> Compare Uttarâdhyayana XIX, 58, p. 95.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_840"></a><a href="sbe4553.htm#fr_846">285:2</a> See note on verse 3.</p>
