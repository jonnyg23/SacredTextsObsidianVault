 <p>In <i>K</i>ampâ there lived a <i>S</i>râvaka, the merchant Pâlita, who was a disciple of the noble and venerable Mahâvîra. (1)</p>  
 <p>As a <i>S</i>râvaka he was well versed in the doctrines of the Nirgranthas. Once he went by boat to the town of Pihu<i>n</i><i>d</i>a on business. (2)</p>  
 <p>A merchant gave him his daughter while he was doing business in Pihu<i>n</i><i>d</i>a. When she was big with child, he took her with him on his returning home. (3)</p>  
 <p>Now the wife of Pâlita was delivered of a child at sea; as the boy was born at sea (samudra), he was named Samudrapâla. (4)</p>  
 <p>Our merchant, the <i>S</i>râvaka, went leisurely to Kampâ, to his house; in his house the boy grew up surrounded by comfort. (5)</p>  
 <p>He studied the seventy-two arts, and acquired knowledge of the world <a name="fr_281"></a><a href="#fn_280"><font size="1">1</font></a>; he was in the bloom of</p>  
 <p>youth, and had a fine figure and good looks. (6) His father procured him a beautiful wife, Rûpi<i>n</i>î, with whom he amused himself in his pleasant palace, like a Dôgundaga god <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_281"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (7)</p>  
 <p>Once upon a time he saw from the window of his palace a man sentenced to death, dressed for execution, on his way to the place of execution. (8)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>Agitated by what he saw, Samudrapâla spoke thus: 'Of wicked actions this is the bad result.' (9)</p>  
 <p>He became enlightened at once, the venerable man, and he was immensely agitated; he took leave of his parents, and entered the state of houselessness. (10)</p>  
 <p>Abandoning the great distress to which the worldly <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">1</font></a> are liable, the great delusion, and whatever causes fear, one should adopt the Law of monks <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">2</font></a>, the vows, the virtues, and the (endurance of) calamities. (11)</p>  
 <p>One should keep the five great vows, viz. not to kill, to speak the truth, not to steal, to be chaste, to have no property whatever; a wise man should follow the Law taught by the <i>G</i>inas. (12)</p>  
 <p>A monk should have compassion on all beings, should be of a forbearing character, should be restrained and chaste, and abstaining from everything sinful; he should live with his senses under control. (13)</p>  
 <p>Now and then <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">3</font></a> he should travel in one country,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>taking into consideration its resources and his own ability; like a lion he should not be frightened by any noise; and whatever words he hears, he should not make an improper reply. (14)</p>  
 <p>In utter indifference he should walk about, and bear everything, be it pleasant or unpleasant; he should not approve of everything everywhere, nor care for <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">1</font></a> respectful treatment or blame. (15)</p>  
 <p>There are many opinions here among men, which a monk places in their true light; there will rise many dangerous and dreadful calamities, caused by gods, men, or animals, which are difficult to be borne and cause easily-discouraged men to sink under them; but a monk who comes in contact with them will not be afraid, like a stately elephant at the head of the battle. (16, 17)</p>  
 <p>Cold and heat, flies and gnats, unpleasant feelings, and many diseases attack the body; without flinching <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">2</font></a> he should bear them, and should</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>not recall to his memory the pleasures he once enjoyed. (18)</p>  
 <p>Giving up love, hatred, and delusion, a monk who is always careful and who is steadfast even as Mount Mêru cannot be shaken by the storm, should bear calamities, guarding himself. (19)</p>  
 <p>A great sage should be neither too elevated by pride nor too humble, he should not care for respectful treatment nor blame; an ascetic who has ceased (to act), will by means of his simplicity enter the path of Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. (20)</p>  
 <p>He is neither grieved nor pleased (by anything) <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he abandons his relations with men, he ceases (to act), is intent on the benefit of his soul, he strives for the highest good (viz. mukti), and uses the means to reach it, free from sorrow, egoism, and any kind of property. (21)</p>  
 <p>A merciful (monk) should use beds distant from others, which are not got ready for his sake <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">2</font></a> nor strewn (with leaves or things considered to be possessed of life); he should sustain such hardships as the sages are accustomed to. (22)</p>  
 <p>The great sage (Samudrapâla), understanding the sacred lore and practising completely the best Law, shone forth like the sun in the sky, being possessed of the highest knowledge and glory. (23)</p>  
 <p>Having annihilated his Karman both meritorious</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>and sinful, being steadfast <a name="fr_290"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and free from all fetters, Samudrapâla crossed the ocean-like Flood of worldly existence and obtained exemption from transmigration. (24)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_280"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_281">108:1</a> To render nîtikôvida.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_281"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_282">108:2</a> For Dôgundaga, see above, <a href="sbe4520.htm#page_88">p. 88</a>, note <a href="sbe4521.htm#fn_235">2</a>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_282"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_283">109:1</a> Saggantha = sagrantha, which is obviously the opposite of nirgrantha. The commentators correct sa<i>m</i>ga<i>m</i>tha in sa<i>m</i>ga<i>m</i> <i>k</i>a. The original reading is in MS. B. A. has sa<i>m</i>ga<i>m</i>tha, and so had C. originally, but it corrects the tha into <i>k</i>a. According to the commentators we should translate: abandoning worldly attachment which causes great distress, great delusion, black (Lê<i>s</i>yâ), and dangers, one should, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_283"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_284">109:2</a> Paryâya-dharma. Paryâya means a state under which a substance presents itself. Here is meant the state of the soul in pravra<i>g</i>yâ, i.e. <i>s</i>râma<i>n</i>ya-paryâya; compare the expressions <i>kh</i>admastha-paryâya and kêvali-paryâya. Paryâya-dharma is here equal to prayra<i>g</i>yâ-dharma, Law of the monks.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_284"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_285">109:3</a> Kâlê<i>n</i>a kâla<i>m</i>, the commentators supply kurvan, and explain the passage as follows: kâlêna, i.e. in a paurushî (four <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a> hours) less one quarter of it, kâlam, i.e. what is proper for the time. The meaning would be 'doing at every time what is proper or prescribed to do at it.' But this explanation looks very artificial; I think that the expression kalê<i>n</i>a kâla<i>m</i> is an adverb of the same type as ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>a<i>m</i> ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>ê<i>n</i>a and many others.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_285"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_286">110:1</a> Sa<i>m</i><i>g</i>ae. This word may be sa<i>m</i>yata in this place; but in verse 20, where the same line occurs again, it cannot be so interpreted, because there the word sa<i>m</i><i>g</i>ae occurs twice; once it has the meaning of sa<i>m</i><i>g</i>ata, but in the passage under discussion it must be a verb, and it is rendered there sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ayet = saṅga<i>m</i> kuryât by the commentators.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_286"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_287">110:2</a> Akukkuô, translated akukû<i>g</i>a, derived from the root kû<i>g</i> 'to warble, to groan;' it would therefore mean 'without complaint.' But in I, 30 we have appakukkuê, derived from the root ku<i>k</i> to bend, to be crooked,' and it is rendered alpaspandana. The same meaning applies in the present case.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_287"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_288">111:1</a> This is the meaning commonly given to the frequently occurring phrase arairaisahe. Another interpretation is: sa<i>m</i>yamâ-sa<i>m</i>yamavishayê, tâbhyâ<i>m</i> na bâdhatê.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_288"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_289">111:2</a> Nirôvalêvâi = nirupalipta. By upalêpa may be meant 'dirt,' but the author of the Ava<i>k</i>ûri explains upalêpa as consisting in abhishvaṅga affection: It is almost impossible to render satisfactorily so vague an expression.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_289"></a><a href="sbe4523.htm#fr_290">112:1</a> Niranga<i>n</i>a = sa<i>m</i>yamê ni<i>s</i><i>k</i>ala, immovable with regard to self-control.</p>
