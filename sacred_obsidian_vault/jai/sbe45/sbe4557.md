 <p>What is the Law that has been preached by the wise Brâhma<i>n</i>a <a name="fr_892"></a><a href="#fn_885"><font size="1">1</font></a> (i.e. Mahâvîra)? Learn from me the noble Law of the <i>G</i>inas as it is. (1)</p>  
 <p>Brâhma<i>n</i>as, Kshattriyas, Vai<i>s</i>yas, <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âlas, Vukkasas, hunters <a name="fr_893"></a><a href="#fn_886"><font size="1">2</font></a>, merchants <a name="fr_894"></a><a href="#fn_887"><font size="1">3</font></a>, <i>S</i>ûdras, and others who are accustomed to do acts; (2)</p>  
 <p>The iniquity <a name="fr_895"></a><a href="#fn_888"><font size="1">4</font></a> of all these men who cling to property goes on increasing; for those who procure themselves pleasures by sinful acts will not get rid of misery. (3)</p>  
 <p>After a man has done acts which cause the death of living beings, his pleasure-seeking relations take possession of his wealth, whilst the doer of the acts must suffer for them. (4)</p>  
 <p>'Mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and sons will not be able to help me, when I suffer for my own deeds <a name="fr_896"></a><a href="#fn_889"><font size="1">5</font></a>.' (5)</p>

 <p>Taking to heart this truth from which flow the most important truths, a monk, without property and without egoism, should follow the teaching of the <i>G</i>inas. (6)</p>  
 <p>Leaving his wealth, sons, relations, and property, leaving sorrow that never ceases, (a monk) should wander about without any worldly interests. (7)</p>  
 <p>Earth, water, fire, and wind; grass, trees, and corn; oviparous animals, the two kinds of viviparous <a name="fr_897"></a><a href="#fn_890"><font size="1">1</font></a> animals; beings engendered in fluids and in dirt, and plants; (8)</p>  
 <p>These six classes of living beings a wise man should know and treat tenderly, in thoughts, words, and acts; he should neither do actions nor desire property whereby he might do them any harm. (9)</p>  
 <p>Untrue speech, sexual intercourse, personal property, taking things that are not freely given: all these causes of injury to living beings a wise man should abstain from. (10)</p>  
 <p>Deceit <a name="fr_898"></a><a href="#fn_891"><font size="1">2</font></a>, greed <a name="fr_899"></a><a href="#fn_892"><font size="1">3</font></a>, anger <a name="fr_900"></a><a href="#fn_893"><font size="1">4</font></a>, and pride <a name="fr_901"></a><a href="#fn_894"><font size="1">5</font></a>: combat these causes of sin; a wise man should abstain from them. (11)</p>  
 <p>Washing, dyeing, making urine, evacuation of the bowels, vomiting, anointing of the eyes, and whatever is contrary to the rules of conduct <a name="fr_902"></a><a href="#fn_895"><font size="1">6</font></a>: from all this a wise man should abstain. (12)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>Perfumes, wreaths, bathing, cleansing of the teeth, property, actions referring to women: from all this a wise man should abstain. (13)</p>  
 <p>Alms that have been prepared, or bought, or stolen, or brought for the sake of a monk, or alms that contain particles of the above mentioned, or such alms as are unacceptable (for one cause or other), from all these a wise man should abstain. (14)</p>  
 <p>Invigorating food, anointing of the eyes, greed, damaging others, washing (one's limbs), (rubbing them with) Lôdhra-powder, &amp;c.: from all this a wise man should abstain. (15)</p>  
 <p>Deliberating with laymen, praising their work, answering their questions, eating the householder's meals: from all this a wise man should abstain. (16)</p>  
 <p>He should not learn to play chess <a name="fr_903"></a><a href="#fn_896"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he should not speak anything forbidden by the Law; a wise man should abstain from fights and quarrels. (17)</p>  
 <p>Shoes, an umbrella, dice, chowries, working for another, helping each other: from all this a wise man should abstain. (18)</p>  
 <p>A monk should not void his excrements or urine among plants; he should never rinse his mouth (even) with distilled water after having removed (everything endowed with life). (19)</p>  
 <p>He should never eat or drink out of a householder's vessel; nor wear his clothes, especially if he</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></a></p>  
 <p>is a naked monk: from all this a wise man should abstain. (20)</p>  
 <p>A stool or bed or a seat in a house, asking of news and recollection (of past sports): from all this a wise man should abstain. (21)</p>  
 <p>Fame, glory, and renown; honours and respectful treatment; all pleasures in the whole world: from all this a wise man should abstain. (22)</p>  
 <p>A monk (should be content) with such food and drink as will sustain his life; he should give a portion of it to others: [from all this a wise man should abstain <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_897"><font size="1">1</font></a>.] (23)</p>  
 <p>Thus spoke the Nirgrantha, the great sage Mahâvîra; he who possesses infinite knowledge and faith has taught the Law and the sacred texts <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_898"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (24)</p>  
 <p>In speaking (a monk) should use as few words as possible; he should not delight in another's foibles; he should avoid deceiving speech <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_899"><font size="1">3</font></a>, and should answer after ripe reflection. (25)</p>  
 <p>One will repent of having used the third kind of speech <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_900"><font size="1">4</font></a>; a secret should not be made known. This is the Nirgrantha's commandment. (26)</p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p>(A monk) should not call one names <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_901"><font size="1">1</font></a>, nor <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>friend,' nor by his Gôtra; 'thou, thou' is vulgar; never address one by 'thou!' (27)</p>  
 <p>A virtuous monk should never keep company (with the wicked); for thereby he incurs dangers (for his conduct) disguised as pleasures. A wise man should be aware of them. (28)</p>  
 <p>(A monk) should not stay in the house of a householder except by constraint; nor should he amuse himself too long (by looking) at the sports of the children of the village <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_902"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (29)</p>  
 <p>Not desirous of fine things, he should wander about, exerting himself; not careless in his conduct, he should bear whatever pains he has to suffer. (30)</p>  
 <p>If beaten, he should not be angry; if abused, he should not fly into a passion; with a placid mind he should bear everything and not make a great noise. (31)</p>  
 <p>He should not enjoy pleasures though they offer themselves; for thus he is said (to reach) discernment. He should always practise what is right to do in the presence of the enlightened ones. (32)</p>  
 <p>He should obey and serve a wise and pious teacher, (such teachers) as are heroes (of faith), who search for the benefit of their souls, are firm in control, and subdue their senses. (33)</p>  
 <p>These men, who do not see the light (as it were) in domestic life, are the beloved of the people; these heroes, free from bondage, do not desire life. (34)</p>  
 <p>

 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>They do not long for sensual pleasures, they do not engage in works. All that (the heretics) always talk about, is opposed to the right faith. (35)</p>  
 <p>Excessive pride and deceit, all worldly vanities: all this a wise man knows and renounces, and thus brings about his final Liberation. (36)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>
