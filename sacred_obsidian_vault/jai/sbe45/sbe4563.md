 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="green">p. 329</font></a></p>  <h2 align="center">FIFTEENTH LECTURE,</h2>  <h6 align="center">CALLED</h6>  <h6 align="center">THE YAMAKAS <a name="fr_968"></a><a href="#fn_961"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</h6>  
 <p>What is past, present, and to come, all this is known to the Leader, the Saviour, who annihilates the hindrances to right faith. (1)</p>  
 <p>The annihilator of doubt knows the incomparable (Law); he, the expounder of the incomparable (Law), is not inclined towards this or that (heretical doctrine). (2).</p>  
 <p>On this or that (article of the creed he has) the correct opinion; hence he is rightly called a true (man); he who always possesses the truth, is kind towards his fellow-creatures. (3)</p>  
 <p>Towards your fellow-creatures be not hostile: that is the Law of him who is rich in control; he who is rich in control renounces everything, and in this (world meditates on the) reflections on life <a name="fr_969"></a><a href="#fn_962"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (4)</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="green">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>He whose soul is purified by meditating on those reflections is compared to a ship in water; like a ship reaching the shore he gets beyond misery. (5)</p>  
 <p>A wise man gets beyond it who knows the sins of this world; sinful acts are got rid of by him who does not undertake any new acts. (6)</p>  
 <p>He who does not undertake new acts does not acquire Karman, and he verily understands (Karman); understanding it he becomes a Great Hero <a name="fr_970"></a><a href="#fn_963"><font size="1">1</font></a>, who is not born (again) and does not die. (7)</p>  
 <p>A Great Hero, who has no Karman, does not die.--As the wind extinguishes a light, (so he puts down) the lovely women in this world. (8)</p>  
 <p>Those men whom women do not seduce, value Môksha most; those men are free from bondage and do not desire life. (9)</p>  
 <p>Turning from worldly life, they reach the goal by pious acts; by their pious acts they are directed (towards Liberation), and they show the way to others. (10)</p>  
 <p>The preaching of the Law (has different effect) on different creatures; he who is rich in control, is. treated with honour <a name="fr_971"></a><a href="#fn_964"><font size="1">2</font></a>, but does not care for it; he exerts himself, subdues his senses, is firm, and abstains from sexual intercourse. (i1)</p>  
 <p>(He should not yield to temptations as a pig which) is decoyed by wild rice, being proof against sins, and free from faults. Being free from faults he always</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="green">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>subdues his senses, and has reached the incomparable cession of Karman <a name="fr_972"></a><a href="#fn_965"><font size="1">1</font></a>. (12)</p>  
 <p>Knowing the incomparable (control), he should not be hostile towards anybody, in thoughts, words, or deeds, having eyes (to see everything). (13)</p>  
 <p>He truly is the eye of men who (dwells so to speak) on the end <a name="fr_973"></a><a href="#fn_966"><font size="1">2</font></a> of desire; on its end (i.e. edge) glides the razor, on its end (i.e. rim) rolls the wheel. (14)</p>  
 <p>Because the wise use the ends (of things, i.e. bad food, &amp;c.), they are called 'makers of an end' here. Here in the world of men we are men to fulfil the Law. (15)</p>  
 <p>In this creed which surpasses the world, (men) become perfected saints or gods, as I have heard; and I have heard that outside the rank of men this is not so <a name="fr_974"></a><a href="#fn_967"><font size="1">3</font></a>. (16)</p>  
 <p>Some (heretics) have said that they (viz. the gods) put an end to misery <a name="fr_975"></a><a href="#fn_968"><font size="1">4</font></a>; but others (<i>G</i>ainas) have repeatedly said that this (human) body is not easily obtained. (17)</p>  
 <p>To one whose soul has left (human life), it is not easy again to obtain instruction (in the Law), nor is such a mental disposition which they declare appropriate for adopting the Law <a name="fr_976"></a><a href="#fn_969"><font size="1">5</font></a>. (18)</p>  
 <p>How can it even be imagined that he should</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>be born again, who professes the pure, complete, unparalleled Law, and is a receptacle of the unparalleled Law? (19)</p>  
 <p>How could the wise Tathâgatas be born again, the Tathâgatas who engage in no undertakings, the supreme, the eyes of the world? (20)</p>  
 <p>And there has been declared by the Kâ<i>s</i>yapa the supreme condition <a name="fr_977"></a><a href="#fn_970"><font size="1">1</font></a>, by realising which some happy and wise men reach excellence. (21)</p>  
 <p>A wise man who has gained strength (in control) which leads to the expiation of sins, annihilates his former works, and does not do new ones. (22)</p>  
 <p>The Great Hero does no actions which are the effects of former sins. By his actions he is directed (towards Môksha), abstaining from works which are entailed by birth <a name="fr_978"></a><a href="#fn_971"><font size="1">2</font></a>. (23)</p>  
 <p>That which all saints value highly (viz. control), destroys the thorn (viz. Karman); practising it some have been liberated, and others have become gods. (24)</p>  
 <p>There have been wise men, and there will be pious men, who having come to the end and made manifest the end of the incomprehensible path, have been liberated. (25)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_961"></a><a href="sbe4563.htm#fr_968">329:1</a> This lecture has been named from its opening words <i>g</i>amaîyam, which also means, consisting of yamakas (compare Journal of the German Oriental Society, vol. xl, p. 101). For in this lecture each verse or line opens with a word repeated from the end of the preceding one. This artifice is technically called <i>s</i><i>ri</i>ṅkhala-yamaka, or chain-yam aka, a term which seems to be contained in another name of our lecture, mentioned by the author of the Niryukti (verse 28), viz. âdâniya-saṅkaliyâ. For saṅkaliyâ is the Prâk<i>ri</i>t for <i>s</i><i>ri</i>ṅkhala (e.g. in our text I, 5, 2, 20), though <i>S</i>îlâṅka here renders it wrongly saṅkalita; and âdâniya by itself is used as a name of our lecture.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_966"></a><a href="sbe4563.htm#fr_973">331:2</a> There is a play on the word 'end' in this and the next verse which to a modern mind savours more of the absurd than the profound.</p>
