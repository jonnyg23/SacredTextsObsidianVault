 <p>There are some tender affections which monks cannot easily overcome. On their account some become disheartened, and are unable to practise control. (1)</p>  
 <p>His relations on seeing him will surround him and cry: 'Child, we have brought you up, (now) support us! O dear! why will you leave us? (2)</p>  
 <p>'Child, your father is an old man; your sister is still very young; (and here), O dear, are your own brothers from the same mother; why will you leave us? (3)</p>  
 <p>'Support your mother and father, thus you will win this world; it is a duty in this world to protect one's mother. (4)</p>  
 <p>'The old people are kind-spoken; your sons, child, are very young; you have married your wife; (take care) that she will not go to another man. (5)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p>'Come, child, let us go home; we can do all the work, you need not (do it); the next time we shall take care (that you will not be overburdened with work); child, let us meanwhile go to our house. (6)</p>  
 <p>'Afterwards you may go again; by this (visit of yours) you will not cease to be a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a; who will hinder you to practise control when you have done with worldly desires <a name="fr_778"></a><a href="#fn_772"><font size="1">1</font></a>? (7)</p>  
 <p>'All your outstanding debts we have divided between us, and we shall give you the money (required for) business.' (8)</p>  
 <p>In this way (his relations) come to him, lamenting, and try to persuade him. Held fast by his attachment for his relations, he quickly returns to his house. (9)</p>  
 <p>As a creeper encircles a tree growing in the forest, so his relations press him hard that he should leave off control. (10)</p>  
 <p>He is held fast by his attachment for his relations. So the keepers always follow a newly-caught elephant, and a cow which has just calved never goes far (from the calf). (11)</p>  
 <p>Men do not (easily) get over this attachment, as (they do not get over) the ocean <a name="fr_779"></a><a href="#fn_773"><font size="1">2</font></a>. For its sake the weak suffer pains, being engrossed by their attachment for their relations. (12)</p>  
 <p>But a monk should renounce it; for every attachment is but a cause of sin. He should not desire life, having been instructed in the best Law. (13)</p>  
 <p>There are these whirlpools which have been</p>

 <p>pointed out by <i>K</i>â<i>s</i>yapa: the wise keep clear of them, but the ignorant go down in them. (14)</p>  
 <p>Kings and ministers of kings, Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Kshattriyas try with pleasant things to seduce a monk who leads a holy life. (15)</p>  
 <p>(They try to seduce him) with elephants, horses, chariots, and cars, with pleasure-trips (saying to him): 'Enjoy these excellent pleasures, great sage, we worship you! (16)</p>  
 <p>'Clothes, perfumes, ornaments, women, and beds: enjoy these pleasures, friend, we worship you! (17)</p>  
 <p>'All the vows which you, holy man, have kept while a monk, are compatible with your living in a house. (18)</p>  
 <p>'It will be no sin, for you have wandered about long (enough).' In this way they try to tempt him, as men decoy a pig with wild rice. (19)</p>  
 <p>Weak men who are exhorted to live as monks, but who are unable to practise control, break down like weak (bullocks carrying a heavy burden) uphill. (20)</p>  
 <p>Unable to practise the rough (i.e. control), and harassed by the austerities, weak men break down, like old oxen in going uphill. (21)</p>  
 <p>When men who are greedy, attached to women, and who love pleasures, are tempted in the way described above, they return to their houses. (22)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>
