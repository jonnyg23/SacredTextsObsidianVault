 <p>Being contemptuously treated for the sake of his birth (as a <i>K</i>â<i>n</i><i>d</i>âla) Sambhûta took, in Hastinâpura,</p>

 <p>the sinful resolution (to become a universal monarch in some later birth); descending from the heavenly region Padmagulma, he was born of <i>K</i>ulanî in Kâmpilya as Brahmadatta; <i>K</i>itra, however, was born in the town Purimatâla in the great family of a merchant; when he had heard the Law, he entered the order. (1, 2)</p>  
 <p>In the town Kâmpilya, both Sambhûta and <i>K</i>itra (as they were called in a former birth) met again and told each other the reward they had realised for their good and bad actions. (3)</p>  
 <p>The universal monarch Brahmadatta, the powerful and glorious king, respectfully addressed the following words to him (who had been) his brother (in a former birth): (4)</p>  
 <p>We were brothers once, kind to each other, loving each other, wishing well to each other. (5)</p>  
 <p>'We were slaves in the country of the Da<i>s</i>âr<i>n</i>as, then antelopes on mount Kâla<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ara, then geese on the shore of M<i>ri</i>tagaṅgâ, and <i>S</i>vapâkas in the land of Kâ<i>s</i>i. (6)</p>  
 <p>'And we were gods having great power, in the regions of the gods. This is our sixth birth, in which we are separated from each other.' (7)</p>  
 <p>"Karman is produced by sinful thoughts, and you have entertained them, O king; it is by the influence of this Karman that we were separated." (8)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>'I had done actions derived from truth and purity, and now I enjoy their effect; is this also true in your case, <i>K</i>itra?' (9)</p>  
 <p>"Every good deed will bear its fruit to men; there is no escape from the effect of one's actions. Through riches and the highest pleasures my soul has got the reward for its virtues. (10)</p>  
 <p>"Know, Sambhûta, that you have got the reward of your virtues in the shape of great wealth and prosperity; but know, O king, that is just so with <i>K</i>itra; he also obtained prosperity and splendour. (11)</p>  
 <p>"A song of deep meaning condensed in words has been repeated in the midst of a crowd of men, (having heard) which monks of piety and virtues exert themselves in this (religion): I have become a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a." (12)</p>  
 <p>'Renowned are my beautiful palaces U<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, Udaya, Madhu, Karka, and Brahman: this house, full of treasures and containing the finest products of the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âlas, O <i>K</i>itra <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_170"><font size="1">1</font></a>, regard it as your own! (13)</p>  
 <p>'Surround yourself with women who dance, and sing, and make music; enjoy these pleasures, O monk; I deem renunciation a hard thing.' (14)</p>  
 <p>As the virtuous <i>K</i>itra, for old friendship's sake, loved the king who was attached to sensual pleasures, and as he had at heart his welfare, he spoke to him the following words: (is)</p>  
 <p>"All singing is but prattle, all dancing is but</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>mocking, all ornaments are but a burden, all pleasures produce but pains. (16)</p>  
 <p>"O king, pleasures which the ignorant like, but which produce pains, do not delight pious monks who care not for pleasure, but are intent on the virtues of right conduct. (17)</p>  
 <p>"Excellent king, the lowest caste of men is that of the <i>S</i>vapâkas, to which we twice belonged; as such we were loathed by all people, and we lived in the hamlets of <i>S</i>vapâkas. (18)</p>  
 <p>"In that miserable birth we lived in the hamlets of <i>S</i>vapâkas, detested by all people; then we acquired the Karman (the fruit of which we now enjoy). (19)</p>  
 <p>"You are now a king of great power and prosperity, enjoying the reward of your good actions; put from you the transitory pleasures, and enter the order for the sake of the highest good <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">1</font></a>! (20)</p>  
 <p>"He who in this life has done no good actions and has not practised the Law, repents of it in the next world when he has become a prey to Death. (21)</p>  
 <p>"As a lion takes hold of an antelope, so Death leads off a man in his last hour; neither mother, nor father, nor brother will, at that time, save a particle (of his life). (22)</p>  
 <p>"Neither his kinsmen, nor his friends, nor his sons, nor his relations will share his suffering, he alone has to bear it; for the Karman follows the doer. (23)</p>  
 <p>"Leaving behind bipeds and quadrupeds, his fields, his house, his wealth, his corn, and everything;</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>against his will, and accompanied only by his Karman <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">1</font></a>, he enters a new existence, either a good or a bad one. (24)</p>  
 <p>"When they have burned with fire on the funeral pile his forlorn, helpless corpse, his wife and sons and kinsfolk will choose another man to provide for them. (25)</p>  
 <p>"Life drags on (towards death) continuously <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">2</font></a>; old age carries off the vigour of man. King of the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âlas, mark my words: do no fearful actions." (26)</p>  
 <p>'I, too, know just as well as you, O saint, what you have told me in your speech: pleasures will get a hold on men and are not easily abandoned by such as we are, sir. (27)</p>  
 <p>'O <i>K</i>itra, in Hastinâpura <a name="fr_175"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">3</font></a> I saw the powerful king (Sanatkumâra), and I took that sinful resolution in my desire for sensual pleasures. (28)</p>  
 <p>And since I did not repent of it, this has come of it, that I still long for sensual pleasures, though I know the Law. (29)</p>  
 <p>'As an elephant, sinking down in a quagmire,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a></p>  
 <p>sees the raised ground but does not get to the shore, so do we who long for sensual pleasures, not follow the path of monks. (30)</p>  
 <p>'Time elapses and quickly pass the days; the pleasures of men are not permanent; they come to a man and leave him just as a bird leaves a tree void of fruit.' (31)</p>  
 <p>"If you are unable to abandon pleasure, then do noble actions, O king; following the Law, have compassion on all creatures: then you will become a god on entering a new existence. (32)</p>  
 <p>"If you have no intention of abandoning pleasure, and still long for undertakings and property, my long talk has been to no purpose. I go, king, farewell." (33)</p>  
 <p>And Brahmadatta, king of the Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>âlas, did not act on the counsel of the saint; he enjoyed the highest pleasure, and (afterwards) sank into the deepest hell. (34)</p>  
 <p>But <i>K</i>itra the great sage, of excellent conduct and penance, was indifferent to pleasure; after he had practised the highest self-control, he reached the highest place of perfection. (35)</p>  
 <p>Thus I say.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_169"></a><a href="sbe4515.htm#fr_170">56:3</a> The stories about <i>K</i>itra and Sambhûta and the fate they <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a> underwent in many births are common to Brahmans, <i>G</i>ainas, and Buddhists. The whole subject has been exhaustively dealt with by Prof. Leumann in two learned papers in the Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. v, pp. 1 ff., 111 ff., where an analysis of the various documents which relate this legend is given, and the Prâk<i>ri</i>t text of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Lectures together with a German translation is published. For all details, therefore, the reader is referred to Prof. Leumann's papers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="sbe4515.htm#fr_171">58:1</a> The commentator constructs <i>K</i>itra with dha<i>n</i>appabhûya: full of manifold treasures; but Prof. Leumann is probably right in taking it as a vocative.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="sbe4515.htm#fr_172">59:1</a> Âdâna, explained <i>k</i>aritradharma.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_172"></a><a href="sbe4515.htm#fr_173">60:1</a> This might be translated, as Professor Leumann suggests: possessing Karman as the germ (of his future destiny); still I prefer the meaning vouched for by the commentators, because karmabî<i>g</i>a generally means the germ, i.e. cause of Karman, see below, Thirty-second Lecture, verse 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_173"></a><a href="sbe4515.htm#fr_174">60:2</a> See Professor Leumann's remarks on this verse, l.c., p. 137 f.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_174"></a><a href="sbe4515.htm#fr_175">60:3</a> When Sunandâ, wife of Sanatkumâra, paid homage to Sambhûta, then a <i>G</i>aina monk, and touched his feet with the curls of her soft hair, he was possessed by the desire to become a universal monarch in reward for his penances. This is the nidâna of which the text speaks, and what I render in this connection by 'taking a resolution.' For the story itself, see my Ausgewählte Erzählungen in Mâhârâsh<i>t</i>rî, p. 5 f.</p>
