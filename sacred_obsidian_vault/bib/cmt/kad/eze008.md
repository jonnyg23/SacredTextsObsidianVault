 <p>Vision of the Destruction of Jerusalem - Ezekiel 8-11
 </p><p>A year and two months after his call, the glory of the Lord appeared to the prophet a second time, as he had seen it by the Chebar. He is transported in spirit to Jerusalem into the court of the temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1-4</a>), where the Lord causes him to see, first the idolatry of Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5-18</a>), and secondly, the judgment why, on account of this idolatry, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem are smitten (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001">Eze 9:1-11</a>), the city is burned with fire, and the sanctuary forsaken by God (Ezekiel 10). Lastly, after he has been charged to foretell to the representatives of the people more especially the coming judgment, and to those who are sent into exile a future salvation (Ezekiel 11:1-21), he describes how the gracious presence of God forsakes the city before his own eyes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#022">Eze 11:22-23</a>). After this has taken place, Ezekiel is carried back in the vision to Chaldea once more; and there, after the vision has come to an end, he announces to the exiles what he has seen and heard (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024">Eze 11:24-25</a>).

 <p>Abominations of the Idolatry of the House of Israel
 </p><p>Time and place of the divine revelation. - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</a>. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth (month), on the fifth (day) of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; there fell upon me the hand of the Lord Jehovah there. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002">Eze 8:2</a>. And I saw, and behold a figure like the look of fire, from the look of its loins downwards fire, and from its loins upwards like a look of brilliance, like the sight of red-hot brass. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003">Eze 8:3</a>. And he stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head, and wind carried me away between earth and heaven, and brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner court, which faces towards the north, where the image of jealousy exciting jealousy had its stand. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004">Eze 8:4</a>. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision which I have seen in the valley. - The place where Ezekiel received this new theophany agrees with the statements in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024">Eze 3:24</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004">Eze 4:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006">Eze 4:6</a>, that he was to shut himself up in his house, and lie 390 days upon the left side, and 40 days upon the right side - in all, 430 days. The use of the word יושׁב, "I sat," is not at variance with this, as ישׁב does not of necessity signify sitting as contrasted with lying, but may also be used in the more general sense of staying, or living, in the house. Nor is the presence of the elders of Judah opposed to the command, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024">Eze 3:24</a>, to shut himself up in the house, as we have already observed in the notes on that passage. The new revelation is made to him in the presence of these elders, because it is of the greatest importance to them. They are to be witnesses of his ecstasy; and after this has left the prophet, are to hear from his lips the substance of the divine revelation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025">Eze 11:25</a>). It is otherwise with the time of the revelation. If we compare the date given in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</a> with those mentioned before, this new vision apparently falls within the period required for carrying out the symbolical actions of the previous vision. Between <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001">Eze 1:1-2</a> (the fifth day of the fourth month in the fifth year) and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</a> (the fifth day of the sixth month in the sixth year) we have one year and two months, that is to say (reckoning the year as a lunar year at 354 days, and the two months at 59 days), 413 days; whereas the two events recorded in Ezekiel 1-7 require at least 437 days, namely 7 days for <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015">Eze 3:15</a>, and 390 + 40 = 430 days for <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005">Eze 4:5-6</a>. Consequently the new theophany would fall within the 40 days, during which Ezekiel was to lie upon the right side for Judah. To get rid of this difficulty, Hitzig conjectures that the fifth year of Jehoiachin (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002">Eze 1:2</a>) was a leap year of 13 months or 385 days, by which he obtains an interval of 444 days after adding 59 for the two months, - a period sufficient not only to include the 7 days (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015">Eze 3:15</a>) and 390 + 40 days (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005">Eze 4:5-6</a>), but to leave 7 days for the time that elapsed between Ezekiel 7 and 8. But however attractive this reckoning may appear, the assumption that the fifth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin was a leap year is purely conjectural; and there is nothing whatever to give it probability. Consequently the only thing that could lead us to adopt such a solution, would be the impossibility of reconciling the conclusion to be drawn from the chronological data, as to the time of the two theophanies, with the substance of these divine revelations.
 </p><p>If we assume that Ezekiel carried out the symbolical acts mentioned in Ezekiel 4 and 5 in all their entirety, we can hardly imagine that the vision described in the chapters before us, by which he was transported in spirit to Jerusalem, occurred within the period of forty days, during which he was to typify the siege of Jerusalem by lying upon his right side. Nevertheless, Kliefoth has decided in favour of this view, and argues in support of it, that the vision described in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</a>. took place in the prophet's own house, that it is identical in substance with what is contained in Ezekiel 3:22-7:27, and that there is no discrepancy, because all that occurred here was purely internal, and the prophet himself was to address the words contained in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#004">Eze 11:4-12</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#014">Eze 11:14-21</a> to the inhabitants of Jerusalem in his state of ecstasy. Moreover, when it is stated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025">Eze 11:25</a> that Ezekiel related to the exiles all that he had seen in the vision, it is perfectly open to us to assume that this took place at the same time as his report to them of the words of God in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001">Eze 6:1-14</a> and 7, and those which follow in Ezekiel 12. But. on the other hand, it may be replied that the impression produced by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#025">Eze 11:25</a> is not that the prophet waited several weeks after his visionary transport to Jerusalem before communicating to the elders what he saw in the vision. And even if the possibility of this cannot be disputed, we cannot imagine any reason why the vision should be shown to the prophet four weeks before it was to be related to the exiles. Again, there is not sufficient identity between the substance of the vision in Ezekiel 8-11 and the revelation in Ezekiel 4-7, to suggest any motive for the two to coincide. It is true that the burning of Jerusalem, which Ezekiel sees in Ezekiel 8-11, is consequent upon the siege and conquest of that city, which he has already predicted in Ezekiel 4-7 both in figure and word; but they are not so closely connected, that it was necessary on account of this connection for it to be shown to him before the completion of the symbolical siege of Jerusalem. And, lastly, although the ecstasy as a purely internal process is so far reconcilable with the prophet's lying upon his right side, that this posture did not preclude a state of ecstasy or render it impossible, yet this collision would ensue, that while the prophet was engaged in carrying out the former word of God, a new theophany would be received by him, which must necessarily abstract his mind from the execution of the previous command of God, and place him in a condition in which it would be impossible for him to set his face firmly upon the siege of Jerusalem, as he had been commanded to do in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007">Eze 4:7</a>. On account of this collision, we cannot subscribe to the assumption, that it was during the time that Ezekiel was lying bound by God upon his right side to bear the sin of Jerusalem, that he was transported in spirit to the temple at Jerusalem. On the contrary, the fact that this transport occurred, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</a>, at a time when he could not have ended the symbolical acts of Ezekiel 4, if he had been required to carry them out in all their external reality, furnishes us with conclusive evidence of the correctness of the view we have already expressed, that the symbolical acts of Ezekiel 4 and 5 did not lie within the sphere of outward reality (see comm. on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004">Eze 5:4</a>). - And if Ezekiel did not really lie for 430 days, there was nothing to hinder his having a fresh vision 14 months after the theophany in Ezekiel 1 and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022">Eze 3:22</a>. For 'תּפּל עלי יד , see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022">Eze 3:22</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003">Eze 1:3</a>.
 </p><p>The figure which Ezekiel sees in the vision is described in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002">Eze 8:2</a> in precisely the same terms as the appearance of God in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027">Eze 1:27</a>. The sameness of the two passages is a sufficient defence of the reading כּמראה־אשׁ against the arbitrary emendation אישׁ 'כם, after the Sept. rendering ὁμοίωμα ἀνδρός, in support of which Ewald and Hitzig appeal to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026">Eze 1:26</a>, though without any reason, as the reading there is not אישׁ, but אדם. It is not expressly stated here that the apparition was in human form - the fiery appearance is all that is mentioned; but this is taken for granted in the allusion to the מתנים (the loins), either as self-evident, or as well known from Ezekiel 1. זהר is synonymous with נגהּ in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004">Eze 1:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027">Eze 1:27</a>. What is new in the present theophany is the stretching out of the hand, which grasps the prophet by the front hair of his head, whereupon he is carried by wind between heaven and earth, i.e., through the air, to Jerusalem, not in the body, but in visions of God (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001">Eze 1:1</a>), that is to say, in spiritual ecstasy, and deposited at the entrance of the inner northern door of the temple. הפּנימית is not an adjective belonging to שׁער, for this is not a feminine noun, but is used as a substantive, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005">Eze 43:5</a> (= החצר הפּנימית: cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#040">Eze 40:40</a>): gate of the inner court, i.e., the gate on the north side of the inner court which led into the outer court. We are not informed whether Ezekiel was placed on the inner or outer side of this gate, i.e., in the inner or outer court; but it is evident from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5</a> that he was placed in the inner court, as his position commanded a view of the image which stood at the entrance of the gate towards the north. The further statement, "where the standing place of the image of jealousy was," anticipates what follows, and points out the reason why the prophet was placed just there. The expression "image of jealousy" is explained by המּקנה, which excites the jealousy of Jehovah (see the comm. on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Exo 20:5</a>). Consequently, we have not to think of any image of Jehovah, but of an image of a heathen idol (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021">Deu 32:21</a>); probably of Baal or Asherah, whose image had already been placed in the temple by Manasseh (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007">Kg2 21:7</a>); certainly not the image of the corpse of Adonis moulded in wax or clay. This opinion, which Hvernick advances, is connected with the erroneous assumption that all the idolatrous abominations mentioned in this chapter relate to the celebration of an Adonis-festival in the temple. There (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#004">Eze 8:4</a>) in the court of the temple Ezekiel saw once more the glory of the God of Israel, as he had seen it in the valley (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022">Eze 3:22</a>) by the Chaboras, i.e., the appearance of God upon the throne with the cherubim and wheels; whereas the divine figure, whose hand grasped him in his house, and transported him to the temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002">Eze 8:2</a>), showed neither throne nor cherubim. The expression "God of Israel," instead of Jehovah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023">Eze 3:23</a>), is chosen as an antithesis to the strange god, the heathen idol, whose image stood in the temple. As the God of Israel, Jehovah cannot tolerate the image and worship of another god in His temple. To set up such an image in the temple of Jehovah was a practical renunciation of the covenant, a rejection of Jehovah on the part of Israel as its covenant God.
 </p><p>Here, in the temple, Jehovah shows to the prophet the various kinds of idolatry which Israel is practising both publicly and privately, not merely in the temple, but throughout the whole land. The arrangement of these different forms of idolatry in four groups of abomination scenes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006">Eze 8:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007">Eze 8:7-12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013">Eze 8:13-15</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016">Eze 8:16-18</a>), which the prophet sees both in and from the court of the temple, belong to the visionary drapery of this divine revelation. It is altogether erroneous to interpret the vision as signifying that all these forms of idolatry were practised in the temple itself; an assumption which cannot be carried out without doing violence to the description, more especially of the second abomination in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007">Eze 8:7-12</a>. Still more untenable is Hvernick's view, that the four pictures of idolatrous practices shown to the prophet are only intended to represent different scenes of a festival of Adonis held in the temple. The selection of the courts of the temple for depicting the idolatrous worship, arises from the fact that the temple was the place where Israel was called to worship the Lord its God. Consequently the apostasy of Israel from the Lord could not be depicted more clearly and strikingly than by the following series of pictures of idolatrous abominations practised in the temple under the eyes of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005">Ezekiel 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 8:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>First Abomination-Picture
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now towards the north. And I lifted up my eyes towards the north, and, behold, to the north of the gate of the altar was this image of jealousy at the entrance. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006">Eze 8:6</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? great abominations, which the house of Israel doeth here, that I may go far away from my sanctuary; and thou shalt yet again see greater abominations still. - As Ezekiel had taken his stand in the inner court at the entrance of the north gate, and when looking thence towards the north saw the image of jealousy to the north of the altar gate, the image must have stood on the outer side of the entrance, so that the prophet saw it as he looked through the open doorway. The altar gate is the same as the northern gate of the inner court mentioned in Ezekiel 3. But it is impossible to state with certainty how it came to be called the altar gate. Possibly from the circumstance that the sacrificial animals were taken through this gate to the altar, to be slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004">Lev 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011">Lev 5:11</a>, etc. מהם, contracted from מה־הם, like מזּה from מה זה in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002">Exo 4:2</a>. The words "what they are doing here" do not force us to assume that at that very time they were worshipping the idol. They simply describe what was generally practised there. The setting up of the image involved the worship of it. The subject to לרחקה is not the house of Israel, but Jehovah. They perform great abominations, so that Jehovah is compelled to go to a distance from His sanctuary, i.e., to forsake it (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023">Eze 11:23</a>), because they make it an idol-temple. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007">Ezekiel 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 8:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Second Abomination: Worship of Beasts
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007">Eze 8:7</a>. And He brought me to the entrance of the court, and I saw, and behold there was a hole in the wall. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#008">Eze 8:8</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, break through the wall: and I broke through the wall, and behold there was a door. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#009">Eze 8:9</a>. And He said to me, Come and see the wicked abominations which they are doing here. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010">Eze 8:10</a>. And I came and saw, and behold there were all kinds of figures of reptiles, and beasts, abominations, and all kinds of idols of the house of Israel, drawn on the wall round about. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011">Eze 8:11</a>. And seventy men of the leaders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, stood in front, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of a cloud of incense arose. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012">Eze 8:12</a>. And He said to me, Seest thou, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in his image-chambers? For they say: Jehovah doth not see us; Jehovah hath forsaken the land. - The entrance of the court to which Ezekiel was now transported cannot be the principal entrance to the outer court towards the east (Ewald). This would be at variance with the context, as we not only find the prophet at the northern entrance in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003">Eze 8:3</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5</a>, but at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014">Eze 8:14</a> we find him there still. If he had been taken to the eastern gate in the meantime, this would certainly have been mentioned. As that is not the case, the reference must be to that entrance to the court which lay between the entrance-gate of the inner court (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003">Eze 8:3</a>) and the northern entrance-gate to the house of Jehovah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014">Eze 8:14</a>), or northern gate of the outer court, in other words, the northern entrance into the outer court. Thus the prophet was conducted out of the inner court through its northern gate into the outer court, and placed in front of the northern gate, which led out into the open air. There he saw a hole in the wall, and on breaking through the wall, by the command of God, he saw a door, and having entered it, he saw all kinds of figures of animals engraved on the wall round about, in front of which seventy of the elders of Israel were standing and paying reverence to the images of beasts with burning incense. According to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012">Eze 8:12</a>, the prophet was thereby shown what the elders of Israel did in the dark, every one in his image-chamber. From this explanation on the part of God concerning the picture shown to the prophet, it is very evident that it had no reference to any idolatrous worship practised by the elders in one or more of the cells of the outer court of the temple. For even though the objection raised by Kliefoth to this view, namely, that it cannot be proved that there were halls with recesses in the outer court, is neither valid nor correct, since the existence of such halls is placed beyond the reach of doubt by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004">Jer 35:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011">Kg2 23:11</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012">Ch1 28:12</a>; such a supposition is decidedly precluded by the fact, that the cells and recesses at the gates cannot have been large enough to allow of seventy-one men taking part in a festive idolatrous service. The supposition that the seventy-one men were distributed in different chambers is at variance with the distinct words of the text. The prophet not only sees the seventy elders standing along with Jaazaniah, but he could not look through one door into a number of chambers at once, and see the pictures draw all round upon their walls. The assembling of the seventy elders in a secret cell by the northern gate of the outer temple to worship the idolatrous images engraved on the walls of the cell, is one feature in the visionary form given to the revelation of what the elders of the people were doing secretly throughout the whole land. To bring out more strikingly the secrecy of this idolatrous worship, the cell is so completely hidden in the wall, that the prophet is obliged to enlarge the hole by breaking through the wall before he can see the door which leads to the cell and gain a view of them and of the things it contains, and the things that are done therein.
 </p><p>(Note: "Because the whole is exhibited pictorially and figuratively, he says that he saw one hole in a wall, and was directed to dig through and make it larger, that he might enter as if through an open door, and see the things which he could not possibly have seen while stationed outside." - Jerome.)
 </p><p>And the number of the persons assembled there suggests the idea of a symbolical representation, as well as the secrecy of the cell. The seventy elders represent the whole nation; and the number is taken from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001">Exo 24:1</a>. and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016">Num 11:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025">Num 24:25</a>, where Moses, by the command of God, chooses seventy of the elders to represent the whole congregation at the making of the covenant, and afterwards to support his authority. This representation of the congregation was not a permanent institution, as we may see from the fact that in Num 11 seventy other men are said to have been chosen for the purpose named. The high council, consisting of seventy members, the so-called Sanhedrim, was formed after the captivity on the basis of these Mosaic types. In the midst of the seventy was Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, a different man therefore from the Jaazaniah mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001">Eze 11:1</a>. Shaphan is probably the person mentioned as a man of distinction in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003">Kg2 22:3</a>.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003">Jer 29:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010">Jer 36:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014">Jer 39:14</a>. It is impossible to decide on what ground Jaazaniah is specially mentioned by name; but it can hardly be on account of the meaning of the name he bore, "Jehovah heard," as Hvernick supposes. It is probable that he held a prominent position among the elders of the nation, so that he is mentioned here by name as the leader of this national representation.
 </p><p>On the wall of the chamber round about there were drawn all kinds of figures of רמשׂ וּבהמה, reptiles and quadrupeds (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024">Gen 1:24</a>). שׁקץ is in apposition not only to בּהמה, but also to רמשׂ, and therefore, as belonging to both, is not to be connected with בּהמה in the construct state. The drawing of reptiles and quadrupeds became a sheqetz, or abomination, from the fact that the pictures had been drawn for the purpose of religious worship. The following clause, "and all the idols of the house of Israel," is co-ordinate with 'כּל־תּבנית וגו. Besides the animals drawn on the walls, there were idols of other kinds in the chamber. The drawing of reptiles and quadrupeds naturally suggests the thought of the animal-worship of Egypt. We must not limit the words to this, however, since the worship of animals is met with in the nature-worship of other heathen nations, and the expression כּל־תּבנית, "all kinds of figures," as well as the clause, "all kinds of idols of the house of Israel," points to every possible form of idol-worship as spread abroad in Israel. עתר, according to the Aramaean usage, signifies suffimentum, perfume, בּחשׁך, in the dark, i.e., in secret, like בּסּתר in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012">Sa2 12:12</a>; not in the sacred darkness of the cloud of incense (Hvernick). חדרי משׂכּית, image-chambers, is the term applied to the rooms or closets in the dwelling-houses of the people in which idolatrous images were set up and secretly worshipped. משׂכּית signifies idolatrous figures, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001">Lev 26:1</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052">Num 33:52</a>. This idolatry was justified by the elders, under the delusion that "Jehovah seeth us not;" that is to say, not: "He does not trouble Himself about us," but He does not see what we do, because He is not omniscient (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015">Isa 29:15</a>); and He has forsaken the land, withdrawn His presence and His help. Thus they deny both the omniscience and omnipresence of God (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009">Eze 9:9</a>).

 <p>Third Abomination: Worship of Thammuz
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#013">Eze 8:13</a>. And He said to me, Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations which they do. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014">Eze 8:14</a>. And He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which is towards the north, and behold there sat the women, weeping for Thammuz. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#015">Eze 8:15</a>. And He said to me, Dost thou see it, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still greater abominations than these. - The prophet is taken from the entrance into the court to the entrance of the gate of the temple, to see the women sitting there weeping for Thammuz. The article in הנּשׁים is used generically. Whilst the men of the nation, represented by the seventy elders, were secretly carrying on their idolatrous worship, the women were sitting at the temple gate, and indulging in public lamentation for Thammuz. Under the weeping for Thammuz, Jerome (with Melito of Sardis and all the Greek Fathers) has correctly recognised the worship of Adonis. "תּמּוּז, Θαμμούζ or Θαμμούς," says Jerome, "whom we have interpreted as Adonis, is called Thamuz both in Hebrew and Syriac; and because, according to the heathen legend, this lover of Venus and most beautiful youth is said to have been slain in the month of June and then restored to life again, they call this month of June by the same name, and keep an annual festival in his honour, at which he is lamented by women as though he were dead, and then afterwards celebrated in songs as having come to life again." This view has not been shaken even by the objections raised by Chwolson in his Ssaabins (II. 27. 202ff.), his relics of early Babylonian literature (p. 101), and his Tammuz and human-worship among the ancient Babylonians. For the myth of Thammuz, mentioned in the Nabataean writings as a man who was put to death by the king of Babylon, whom he had commanded to introduce the worship of the seven planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac, and who was exalted to a god after his death, and honoured with a mourning festival, is nothing more than a refined interpretation of the very ancient nature-worship which spread over the whole of Hither Asia, and in which the power of the sun over the vegetation of the year was celebrated. The etymology of the word Tammuz is doubtful. It is probably a contraction of תּמזוּז, from מזז = מסס, so that it denotes the decay of the force of nature, and corresponds to the Greek ἀφανισμὸς  ̓Αδώνιδος (see Hvernick in loc.).

 <p>Fourth Abomination: Worship of the Sun by the Priests
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016">Eze 8:16</a>. And He took me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and behold, at the entrance into the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, as it were five and twenty men,with their backs towards the temple of Jehovah and their faces towards the east; they were worshipping the sun towards the east. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017">Eze 8:17</a>. And He said to me, Seest thou this, son of Man? Is it too little for the house of Judah to perform the abominations which they are performing here, that they also fill the land with violence, and provoke me to anger again and again? For behold they stretch out the vine-branch to their nose. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018">Eze 8:18</a>. But I also will act in fury; my eye shall not look compassionately, and I will not spare; and if they cry with a loud voice in my ears, I will not hear them. - After Ezekiel has seen the idolatrous abominations in the outer court, or place for the people, he is taken back into the inner court, or court of the priests, to see still greater abominations there. Between the porch of the temple and the altar of burnt-offering, the most sacred spot therefore in the inner court, which the priests alone were permitted to tread (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017">Joe 2:17</a>), he sees as if twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple, were worshipping the sun in the east. כּ before עשׂרים is not a preposition, circa, about, but a particle of comparison (an appearance): as if twenty-five men; after the analogy of כּ before an accusative (vid., Ewald, 282d). For the number here is not an approximative one; but twenty-five is the exact number, namely, the twenty-four leaders of the classes of priests (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005">Ch1 24:5</a>.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014">Ch2 36:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#005">Ezr 10:5</a>), with the high priest at the head (see Lightfoot's Chronol. of O.T., Opp. I. 124). As the whole nation was seen in the seventy elders, so is the entire priesthood represented here in the twenty-five leaders as deeply sunk in disgraceful idolatry. Their apostasy from the Lord is shown in the fact that they turn their back upon the temple, and therefore upon Jehovah, who was enthroned in the temple, and worship the sun, with their faces turned towards the east. The worship of the sun does not refer to the worship of Adonis, as Hvernick supposes, although Adonis was a sun-god; but generally to the worship of the heavenly bodies, against which Moses had warned the people (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019">Deu 4:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003">Deu 17:3</a>), and which found its way in the time of Manasseh into the courts of the temple, whence it was afterwards expelled by Josiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005">Kg2 23:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011">Kg2 23:11</a>). The form משׁתתּויתם must be a copyist's error for משׁתּחוים; as the supposition that it is an unusual form, with a play upon השׁחית,
 </p><p>(Note: "An extraordinary form, invented for the purpose of more effectually expressing their extraordinary abomination." - Lightfoot.)
 </p><p>is precluded by the fact that it would in that case be a 2nd per. plur. perf., and such a construction is rendered impossible by the המּה which immediately precedes it (cf. Ewald, 118a).
 </p><p>To these idolatrous abominations Judah has added other sins, as if these abominations were not bad enough in themselves. This is the meaning of the question in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017">Eze 8:17</a>, 'הנּקל וגו: is it too little for the house of Judah, etc.? נקל with מן, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</a>. To indicate the fulness of the measure of guilt, reference is again briefly made to the moral corruption of Judah. חמס embraces all the injuries inflicted upon men; תּועבות, impiety towards God, i.e., idolatry. By violent deeds they provoke God repeatedly to anger (שׁוּב, followed by an infinitive, expresses the repetition of an action). The last clause of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017">Eze 8:17</a> ('והנּם שׁלחים וגו) is very obscure. The usual explanation, which has been adopted by J. D. Michaelis and Gesenius: "they hold the twig to their nose," namely, the sacred twig Barsom, which the Parsees held in their hands when praying (vid., Hyde, de relig. vet. Pars. p. 350, ed. 2; and Kleuker, Zend-Avesta, III. p. 204), suits neither the context nor the words. According to the position of the clause in the context, we do not expect an allusion to a new idolatrous rite, but an explanation of the way in which Judah had excited the wrath of God by its violent deeds. Moreover, זמורה is not a suitable word to apply to the Barsom - Zemōrâh is a shoot or tendril of the vine (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002">Eze 15:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#010">Isa 17:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023">Num 13:23</a>). The Barsom, on the other hand, consisted of bunches of twigs of the tree Gez or Hom, or of branches of the pomegranate, the tamarisk, or the date (cf. Kleuker l.c., and Strabo, XV. 733), and was not held to the nose, but kept in front of the mouth as a magical mode of driving demons away (vid., Hyde, l.c.). Lastly, שׁלח אל does not mean to hold anything, but to stretch out towards, to prepare to strike, to use violence. Of the other explanations given, only two deserve any consideration - namely, first, the supposition that it is a proverbial expression, "to apply the twig to anger," in the sense of adding fuel to the fire, which Doederlein (ad Grotii adnott.) applies in this way, "by these things they supply food, as it were, to my wrath, which burns against themselves," i.e., they bring fuel to the fire of my wrath. Lightfoot gives a similar explanation in his Hor. hebr. ad <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006">Joh 15:6</a>. The second is that of Hitzig: "they apply the sickle to their nose," i.e., by seeking to injure me, they injure themselves. In this case זמורה must be taken in the sense of מזמּרה, a sickle or pruning-knife, and pointed זמורה. The saying does appear to be a proverbial one, but the origin and meaning of the proverb have not yet been satisfactorily explained. - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018">Eze 8:18</a>. Therefore will the Lord punish unsparingly (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#004">Eze 7:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#009">Eze 7:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011">Eze 5:11</a>). This judgment he shows to the prophet in the two following chapters.
