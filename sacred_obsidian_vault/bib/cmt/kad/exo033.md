 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001">Exodus 33:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">exo 33:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Moses' negotiations with the people, for the purpose of bringing them to sorrow and repentance, commenced with the announcement of what Jehovah had said. The words of Jehovah in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001">Exo 33:1-3</a>, which are only a still further expansion of the assurance contained in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034">Exo 32:34</a>, commence in a similar manner to the covenant promise in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020">Exo 23:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#023">Exo 23:23</a>; but there is this great difference, that whereas the name, i.e., the presence of Jehovah Himself, was to have gone before the Israelites in the angel promised to the people as a leader in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020">Exo 23:20</a>, now, though Jehovah would still send an angel before Moses and Israel, He Himself would not go up to Canaan (a land flowing, etc., see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008">Exo 3:8</a>) in the midst of Israel, lest He should destroy the people by the way, because they were stiff-necked (אכלך for אכלך, see Ges. 27, 3, Anm. 2). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#004">Exodus 33:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">exo 33:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The people were so overwhelmed with sorrow by this evil word, that they all put off their ornaments, and showed by this outward sign the trouble of their heart, 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#005">Exodus 33:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">exo 33:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That this good beginning of repentance might lead to a true and permanent change of heart, Jehovah repeated His threat in a most emphatic manner: "Thou art a stiff-necked people; if I go a moment in the midst of thee, I destroy thee:" i.e., if I were to go up in the midst of thee for only a single moment, I should be compelled to destroy thee because of thine obduracy. He then issued this command: "Throw thine ornament away from thee, and I shall know (by that) what to do to thee." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#006">Exodus 33:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">exo 33:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And the people obeyed this commandment, renouncing all that pleased the eye. "The children of Israel spoiled themselves (see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#036">Exo 12:36</a>) of their ornament from Mount Horeb onwards." Thus they entered formally into a penitential condition. The expression, "from Mount Horeb onwards," can hardly be paraphrased as it is by Seb. Schmidt, viz., "going from Mount Horeb into the camp," but in all probability expresses this idea, that from that time forward, i.e., after the occurrence of this event at Horeb, they laid aside the ornaments which they had hitherto worn, and assumed the outward appearance of perpetual penitence. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007">Exodus 33:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">exo 33:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Moses then took a tent, and pitched it outside the camp, at some distance off, and called it "tent of meeting." The "tent" is neither the sanctuary of the tabernacle described in Ex 25., which was not made till after the perfect restoration of the covenant (Ex 35.), nor another sanctuary that had come down from their forefathers and was used before the tabernacle was built, as Clericus, J. D. Michaelis, Rosenmller, and others suppose; but a tent belonging to Moses, which was made into a temporary sanctuary by the fact that the pillar of cloud came down upon it, and Jehovah talked with Moses there, and which was called by the same name as the tabernacle, viz., מועד אחל (see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021">Exo 27:21</a>), because Jehovah revealed Himself there, and every one who sought Him had to go to this tent outside the camp. There were two reasons for this: in the first place, Moses desired thereby to lead the people to a fuller recognition of their separation from their God, that their penitence might be deepened in consequence; and in the second place, he wished to provide such means of intercourse with Jehovah as would not only awaken in the minds of the people a longing for the renewal of the covenant, but render the restoration of the covenant possible. And this end was answered. Not only did every one who sought Jehovah go out to the tent, but the whole nation looked with the deepest reverence when Moses went out to the tent, and bowed in adoration before the Lord, every one in front of his tent, when they saw the pillar of cloud come down upon the tent and stand before the door. Out of this cloud Jehovah talked with Moses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007">Exo 33:7-10</a>) "face to face, as a man talks with his friend" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011">Exo 33:11</a>); that is to say, not from the distance of heaven, through any kind of medium whatever, but "mouth to mouth," as it is called in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008">Num 12:8</a>, as closely and directly as friends talk to one another. "These words indicate, therefore, a familiar conversation, just as much as if it had been said, that God appeared to Moses in some peculiar form of manifestation. If any one objects to this, that it is at variance with the assertion which we shall come to presently, 'Thou canst not see My face,' the answer is a very simple one. Although Jehovah showed Himself to Moses in some peculiar form of manifestation, He never appeared in His own essential glory, but only in such a mode as human weakness could bear. This solution contains a tacit comparison, viz., that there never was any one equal to Moses, or who had attained to the same dignity as he" (Calvin). When Moses returned to the tent, his servant Joshua remained behind as guard. - This condescension on the part of Jehovah towards Moses could not fail to strengthen the people in their reliance upon their leader, as the confidant of Jehovah. And Moses himself was encouraged thereby to endeavour to effect a perfect restoration of the covenant bond that had been destroyed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012">Exodus 33:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">exo 33:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Jehovah had commanded Moses to lead the people to Canaan, and promised him the guidance of an angel; but He had expressly distinguished this angel from His own personal presence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001">Exo 33:1-3</a>). Moreover, though it has not been mentioned before, Jehovah had said to Moses, "I have known thee by name," - i.e., I have recognised thee as Mine, and chosen and called thee to execute My will (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001">Isa 43:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001">Isa 49:1</a>), or put thee into "a specifically personal relation to God, which was peculiar to Moses, and therefore was associated with his name" (Oehler); - "and thou hast also found grace in My eyes," inasmuch as God had granted a hearing to his former intercession. Moses now reminded the Lord of this divine assurance with such courage as can only be produced by faith, which wrestles with God and will not let Him go without a blessing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#027">Gen 32:27</a>); and upon the strength of this he presented the petition (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013">Exo 33:13</a>), "Let me know Thy way (the way which Thou wilt take with me and with this people), that I may know Thee, in order that I may find grace in Thine eyes, and see that this people is Thy people." The meaning is this: If I have found grace in Thy sight, and Thou hast recognised me as Thy servant, and called me to be the leader of this people, do not leave me in uncertainty as to Thine intentions concerning the people, or as to the angel whom Thou wilt give as a guide to me and the nation, that I may know Thee, that is to say, that my finding grace in Thine eyes may become a reality; 
 </p><p>(Note: Domine fac ut verbis tuis respondeat eventus. Calvin.)
 </p><p>and if Thou wilt lead the people up to Canaan, consider that it is Thine own people, to whom Thou must acknowledge Thyself as its God. Such boldness of undoubting faith presses to the heart of God, and brings away the blessing. Jehovah replied (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014">Exo 33:14</a>), "My face will go, and I shall give thee rest," - that is to say, shall bring thee and all this people into the land, where ye will find rest (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020">Deu 3:20</a>). The "face" of Jehovah is Jehovah in His own personal presence, and is identical with the "angel" in whom the name of Jehovah was (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020">Exo 23:20-21</a>), and who is therefore called in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009">Isa 63:9</a> "the angel of His face."
 </p><p>With this assurance on the part of God, the covenant bond was completely restored. But to make more sure of it. Moses replied (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015">Exo 33:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016">Exo 33:16</a>), "If Thy face is not going (with us), lead us not up hence. And whereby shall it be known that I have found grace in thine eyes, I and Thy people, if not (lit., is it not known) in Thy going with us, that we, I and Thy people, are distinguished (see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018">Exo 8:18</a>) before every nation upon the face of the earth?" These words do not express any doubt as to the truth of the divine assurance, "but a certain feeling of the insufficiency of the assurance," inasmuch as even with the restoration of the former condition of things there still remained "the fear lest the evil root of the people's rebellion, which had once manifested itself, should bread forth again at any moment" (Baumgarten). For this reason Jehovah assured him that this request also should be granted (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017">Exo 33:17</a>). "There was nothing extraordinary in the fact that Moses desired for himself and his people that they might be distinguished before every nation upon the face of the earth; this was merely the firm hold of faith upon the calling and election of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5-6</a>)." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018">Exodus 33:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">exo 33:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Moses was emboldened by this, and now prayed to the Lord, "Let me see Thy glory." What Moses desired to see, as the answer of God clearly shows, must have been something surpassing all former revelations of the glory of Jehovah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#007">Exo 16:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010">Exo 16:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016">Exo 24:16-17</a>), and even going beyond Jehovah's talking with him face to face (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011">Exo 33:11</a>). When God talked with him face to face, or mouth to mouth, he merely saw a "similitude of Jehovah" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008">Num 12:8</a>), a form which rendered the invisible being of God visible to the human eye, i.e., a manifestation of the divine glory in a certain form, and not the direct or essential glory of Jehovah, whilst the people saw this glory under the veil of a dark cloud, rendered luminous by fire, that is to say, they only saw its splendour as it shone through the cloud; and even the elders, at the time when the covenant was made, only saw the God of Israel in a certain form which hid from their eyes the essential being of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010">Exo 24:10-11</a>). What Moses desired, therefore, was a sight of the glory or essential being of God, without any figure, and without a veil.
 </p><p>Moses was urged to offer this prayer, as Calvin truly says, not by "stulta curiositas, quae ut plurimum titillat hominum mentes, ut audacter penetrare tentent usque ad ultima caelorum arcana," but by "a desire to cross the chasm which had been made by the apostasy of the nation, that for the future he might have a firmer footing than the previous history had given him. As so great a stress had been laid upon his own person in his present task of mediation between the offended Jehovah and the apostate nation, he felt that the separation, which existed between himself and Jehovah, introduced a disturbing element into his office. For if his own personal fellowship with Jehovah was not fully established, and raised above all possibility of disturbance, there could be no eternal foundation for the perpetuity of his mediation" (Baumgarten). As a man called by God to be His servant, he was not yet the perfect mediator; but although he was faithful in all his house, it was only as a servant, called εἰς μαρτύριον τῶν λαληθησομένων (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005">Heb 3:5</a>), i.e., as a herald of the saving revelations of God, preparing the way for the coming of the perfect Mediator. Jehovah therefore granted his request, but only so far as the limit existing between the infinite and holy God and finite and sinful man allowed. "I will make all My goodness pass before thy face, and proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee (בּשׁם קרא see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026">Gen 4:26</a>), and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. Thou canst not see My face, for man cannot see Me and live." The words וגו וחנּתי, although only connected with the previous clause by the cop. ו, are to be understood in a causative sense, as expressing the reason why Moses' request was granted, viz., that it was an act of unconditional grace and compassion on the part of God, to which no man, not even Moses, could lay any just claim. The apostle Paul uses the words in the same sense in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015">Rom 9:15</a>, for the purpose of overthrowing the claims of self-righteous Jews to participate in the Messianic salvation. - No mortal man can see the face of God and remain alive; for not only is the holy God a consuming fire to unholy man, but a limit has been set, in and with the σῶμα χοΐκόν and ψυχικόν (the earthly and psychical body) of man, between the infinite God, the absolute Spirit, and the human spirit clothed in an earthly body, which will only be removed by the "redemption of our body," and our being clothed in a "spiritual body," and which, so long as it lasts, renders a direct sight of the glory of God impossible. As our bodily eye is dazzled, and its power of vision destroyed, by looking directly at the brightness of the sun, so would our whole nature be destroyed by an unveiled sight of the brilliancy of the glory of God. So long as we are clothed with this body, which was destined, indeed, from the very first to be transformed into the glorified state of the immortality of the spirit, but has become through the fall a prey to the corruption of death, we can only walk in faith, and only see God with the eye of faith, so far as He has revealed His glory to us in His works and His word. When we have become like God, and have been transformed into the "divine nature" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004">Pe2 1:4</a>), then, and not till then, shall we see Him as He is; then we shall see His glory without a veil, and live before Him for ever. For this reason Moses had to content himself with the passing by of the glory of God before his face, and with the revelation of the name of Jehovah through the medium of the word, in which God discloses His inmost being, and, so to speak, His whole heart to faith. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022">Exo 33:22</a> "My glory" is used for "all My goodness," and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006">Exo 34:6</a> it is stated that Jehovah passed by before the face of Moses. טוּב is not to be understood in the sense of beautiful, or beauty, but signifies goodness; not the brilliancy which strikes the senses, but the spiritual and ethical nature of the Divine Being. For the manifestation of Jehovah, which passed before Moses, was intended unquestionably to reveal nothing else than what Jehovah expressed in the proclamation of His name.
 </p><p>The manifested glory of the Lord would so surely be followed by the destruction of man, that even Moses needed to be protected before it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021">Exo 33:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022">Exo 33:22</a>). Whilst Jehovah, therefore, allowed him to come to a place upon the rock near Him, i.e., upon the summit of Sinai (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002">Exo 34:2</a>), He said that He would put him in a cleft of the rock whilst He was passing by, and cover him with His hand when He had gone by, that he might see His back, because His face could not be seen. The back, as contrasted with the face, signifies the reflection of the glory of God that had just passed by. The words are transferred anthropomorphically from man to God, because human language and human thought can only conceive of the nature of the absolute Spirit according to the analogy of the human form. As the inward nature of man manifests itself in his face, and the sight of his back gives only an imperfect and outward view of him, so Moses saw only the back and not the face of Jehovah. It is impossible to put more into human words concerning this unparalleled vision, which far surpasses all human thought and comprehension. According to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#002">Exo 34:2</a>, the place where Moses stood by the Lord was at the top (the head) of Sinai, and no more can be determined with certainty concerning it. The cleft in the rock (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022">Exo 33:22</a>) has been supposed by some to be the same place as the "cave" in which Elijah lodged at Horeb, and where the Lord appeared to him in the still small voice (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009">Kg1 19:9</a>.). The real summit of the Jebel Musa consists of "a small area of huge rocks, about 80 feet in diameter," upon which there is now a chapel that has almost fallen down, and about 40 feet to the south-west a dilapidated mosque (Robinson, Palestine, vol. i. p. 153). Below this mosque, according to Seetzen (Reise iii. pp. 83, 84), there is a very small grotto, into which you descend by several steps, and to which a large block of granite, about a fathom and a half long and six spans in height, serves as a roof. According to the Mussulman tradition, which the Greek monks also accept, it was in this small grotto that Moses received the law; though other monks point out a "hole, just large enough for a man," near the altar of the Elijah chapel, on the small plain upon the ridge of Sinai, above which the loftier peak rises about 700 feet, as the cave in which Elijah lodged on Horeb (Robinson, Pal. ut supra).
