 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#002">Job 12:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 12:2</a></font></span></p>No doubt but ye [are] the people, and (a) wisdom shall die with you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because you do not feel what you speak, you think the whole stands in words, and so flatter yourselves as though no one else knew anything, or could know except you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004">Job 12:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 12:4</a></font></span></p>I am (b) [as] one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he (c) answereth him: the just upright [man is] laughed to scorn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He reproves his friends for two faults: one, that they thought they had better knowledge than they did: and the other, that instead of true consolation, they derided and despised their friend in his adversity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Who being a mocker and a wicked man, thinks that no man is in God's favour but he, because he has all things that he desires.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#005">Job 12:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 12:5</a></font></span></p>(d) He that is ready to slip with [his] feet [is as] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) As the rich do not esteem a light or torch that goes out, so he despised he that falls from prosperity to adversity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007">Job 12:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 12:7</a></font></span></p>But ask now the beasts, (e) and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He declares to them that disputed against him, that their wisdom is common to all, and such as the very brute beasts teach daily.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011">Job 12:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 12:11</a></font></span></p>Doth not the ear (f) try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He exhorts them to be wise in judging, and as well to know the right use of their God-given ears, as well as their mouths.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#012">Job 12:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 12:12</a></font></span></p>With the (g) ancient [is] wisdom; and in length of days understanding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though men by age and continuance of time attain wisdom, yet it is not comparable to God's wisdom, nor able to comprehend his judgments, in which he answers to that which was alleged, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008">Job 8:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016">Job 12:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 12:16</a></font></span></p>With him [is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the (h) deceiver [are] his. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He shows that there is nothing done in this world without God's will and ordinance, else he would not be Almighty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018">Job 12:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 12:18</a></font></span></p>(i) He looseth (k) the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He takes wisdom from them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) He abates the humour of princes, and brings them into the subjection of others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020">Job 12:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 12:20</a></font></span></p>He removeth away the speech of the (l) trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) He causes their words to have no credit, which is when he will punish sin.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#023">Job 12:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 12:23</a></font></span></p>He (m) increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them [again]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) In this discourse of God's wonderful works, Job shows that whatever is done in this world both in the order and change of things, is by God's will and appointment, in which he declares that he thinks well of God, and is able to set forth his power in words as they that reasoned against him were.
