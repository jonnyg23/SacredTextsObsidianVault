 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The Lord, who is Christ, will have all power given to him. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) That they may acknowledge their sins, and turn to him.

 <p>
 </p><p>(m) The prophet seeing the small hope that the Jews would convert, complains to God as though he had utterly forsaken them for their sins.
