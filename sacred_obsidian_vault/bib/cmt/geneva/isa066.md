 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001">Isaiah 66:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 66:1</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, The (a) heaven [is] my throne, and the earth [is] my footstool: where [is] the house that ye build to me? and where [is] the place of my rest? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) My majesty is so great, that it fills both heaven and earth, and therefore cannot be included in a temple like an idol, condemning by this their main confidence which trusted in the temple and sacrifices.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">Isaiah 66:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 66:2</a></font></span></p>For all these [things] hath my hand made, (b) and all these [things] have been, saith the LORD: but to this [man] will I look, [even] to [him that is] poor and of (c) a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Seeing that both the temple and the things in it, with the sacrifices were made and done by his appointment, he shows that he has no need of it, and that he can be without them, See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010">Psa 50:10</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) To him that is humble and pure in heart, who receives my doctrine with reverence and fear.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003">Isaiah 66:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 66:3</a></font></span></p>He that killeth an ox [is as if] he (d) slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, [as if] he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, [as if he offered] swine's blood; he that burneth incense, [as if] he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Because the Jews thought themselves holy by offering their sacrifices, and in the mean season had neither faith or repentance, God shows that he no less detests these ceremonies than he does the sacrifices of the heathen, who offered men, dogs and swine to their idols, which things were expressly forbidden in the law.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004">Isaiah 66:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 66:4</a></font></span></p>I also will (e) choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose [that] in which I delighted not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) I will discover their wickedness and hypocrisy, with which they think to blind my eyes to all the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005">Isaiah 66:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 66:5</a></font></span></p>Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his (f) word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He encourages the faithful by promising to destroy their enemies, who pretended to be as brethren, but were hypocrites, and hated them that feared God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#006">Isaiah 66:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 66:6</a></font></span></p>(g) A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The enemies will shortly hear a more terrible voice, even fire and slaughter, seeing they would not hear the gentle voice of the prophets, who called them to repentance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007">Isaiah 66:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 66:7</a></font></span></p>Before (h) she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning, that the restoration of the church would be so sudden and contrary to all men's opinions as when a woman is delivered before she looked for it, and without pain in travail.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008">Isaiah 66:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 66:8</a></font></span></p>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one (i) day? [or] shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) This will pass the capacity of man to see such a multitude that will come up at once, meaning under the preaching of the gospel of which they who came out of Babylon were a sign.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#009">Isaiah 66:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 66:9</a></font></span></p>Shall I (k) bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut [the womb]? saith thy God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Declaring by this that as by his power and providence women travailed and delivered so he gives power to bring forth the Church at his appointed time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011">Isaiah 66:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 66:11</a></font></span></p>That ye may nurse, (l) and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may draw milk, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 66:12</a></font></span></p>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend (m) peace to her like a river, and the glory of the (n) Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye be nursed, ye shall be (o) borne upon [her] sides, and be dandled upon [her] knees. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) I will give her happiness and prosperity in great abundance. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016">Isa 60:16</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) You will be cherished as her dearly beloved children.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 66:14</a></font></span></p>And when ye see [this], your heart shall rejoice, and your (p) bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and [his] indignation toward his enemies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) You will have new strength and new beauty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015">Isaiah 66:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">isa 66:15</a></font></span></p>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to (q) render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) This vengeance God began to execute at the destruction of Babylon and has always continued it against the enemies of his Church, and will do till the last day, which will be the accomplishment of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017">Isaiah 66:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">isa 66:17</a></font></span></p>They that sanctify (r) themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one [tree] in the midst, eating (s) swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Meaning, the hypocrites.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">isa 66:18</a></font></span></p>For I [know] their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my (t) glory. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) The Gentiles will be partakers of that glory, which before I showed to the Jews.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019">Isaiah 66:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 66:19</a></font></span></p>And I will set a (u) sign among them, and I will send those that (x) escape of them to the nations, [to] (y) Tarshish, (z) Pul, and (a) Lud, that draw the (b) bow, [to] (c) Tubal, and (d) Javan, [to] the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and (e) they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) I will make these that I chose, that they perish not with the rest of the infidels: by which he alludes to the marking of the posts of his people, whom he preserved, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007">Exo 12:7</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 66:20</a></font></span></p>And they shall bring all your (f) brethren [for] an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon (g) horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 66:21</a></font></span></p>And I will also take of them for (h) priests [and] for Levites, saith the LORD.
