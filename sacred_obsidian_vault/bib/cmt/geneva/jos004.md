 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God commands that not only we ourselves profit by this wonderful work, but that our posterity may know the cause of it, and glorify his Name.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Because the ark testified God's presence, and the tables of the Law contained in it signified God's will toward his people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019">Joshua 4:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jos 4:19</a></font></span></p>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth [day] of the (h) first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) God's benefits serve as a further condemnation to the wicked, and stir up his own to reverence and obey him.
