 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 127:1</a></font></span></p>"A Song of degrees for Solomon." Except the LORD (a) build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the (b) city, the watchman waketh [but] in vain. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, govern and dispose all things pertaining to the family. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) The public estate of the commonwealth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002">Psalms 127:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 127:2</a></font></span></p>[It is] vain for (c) you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread (d) of sorrows: [for] so he giveth his beloved (e) sleep. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Who watch and ward and are also magistrates and rulers of the city. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Either that which is gained by hard labour, or eaten with grief of mind. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Not exempting them from labour, but making their labours comfortable and as it were a rest.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004">Psalms 127:4</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, endued with strength and virtues from God: for these are signs of God's blessings, and not the number.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005">Psalms 127:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 127:5</a></font></span></p>Happy [is] the man that hath his quiver full of them: they (g) shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Such children will be able to stop their adversaries mouths, when their godly life is maliciously accused before judges.
