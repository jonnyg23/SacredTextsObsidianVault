 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001">Matthew 25:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mat 25:1</a></font></span></p>Then (1) shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and (a) went forth to meet the bridegroom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) We must desire strength from God's hand which may serve us as a torch while we walk through this darkness, to bring us to our desired end: otherwise, if we become slothful and negligent because we are weary of our pains and travail, we shall be kept from entering the doors. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) The pomp of weddings was usually preferred to be done at night, and that by young unmarried women.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005">Matthew 25:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mat 25:5</a></font></span></p>While the bridegroom tarried, they all (b) slumbered and slept. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Their eyes being heavy with sleep.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014">Matthew 25:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mat 25:14</a></font></span></p>(2) For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Christ witnesses that there will be a long time between his departure to his Father and his coming again to us, but yet notwithstanding that, he will at that day take an account not only of the rebellious and obstinate, how they have made use of that which they received from him, but also of his household servants, who have because of slothfulness not employed those gifts which he bestowed upon them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015">Matthew 25:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">mat 25:15</a></font></span></p>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several (c) ability; and straightway took his journey. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) According to the wisdom and skill in dealing which was given to them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021">Matthew 25:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mat 25:21</a></font></span></p>His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: (d) enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Come and receive the fruit of my goodness: now the Lord's joy is doubled; see (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011">Joh 15:11</a>): that my joy may remain in you, and your joy be fulfilled.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027">Matthew 25:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">mat 25:27</a></font></span></p>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the (e) exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Bankers who have their shops or tables set up abroad, where they lend money at interest. Usury or loaning money at interest is strictly forbidden by the Bible, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025">Exo 22:25-27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019">Deu 23:19-20</a>). Even a rate as low as one per cent interest was disallowed, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#011">Neh 5:11</a>). This servant had already told two lies. First he said the master was an austere or harsh man. This is a lie for the Lord is merciful and gracious. Next he called his master a thief because he reaped where he did not sow. Finally the master said to him sarcastically why did you not add insult to injury and loan the money out at interest so you could call your master a "usurer" too! If the servant had done this, his master would have been responsible for his servant's actions and guilty of usury.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031">Matthew 25:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">mat 25:31</a></font></span></p>(3) When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) A graphic setting forth of the everlasting judgment which is to come.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034">Matthew 25:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">mat 25:34</a></font></span></p>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye (f) blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Blessed and happy, upon whom my Father has most abundantly bestowed his benefits.
