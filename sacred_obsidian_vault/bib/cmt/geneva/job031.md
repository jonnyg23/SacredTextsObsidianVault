 <p>
 </p><p>(a) I kept my eyes from all wanton looks. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Would not God then have punished me?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#003">Job 31:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 31:3</a></font></span></p>[Is] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to (c) the workers of iniquity? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Job declares that the fear of God was a bridle to stay him from all wickedness.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 31:6</a></font></span></p>Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine (d) integrity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He shows what his uprightness stands in, in as much as he was blameless before men and did not sin against the second table.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007">Job 31:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 31:7</a></font></span></p>If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart (e) walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, has accomplished the lust of my eyes.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#008">Job 31:8</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) If I had oppressed others, how would I have escaped God's judgment.

 <p>
 </p><p>(q) I did not refrain from sin for fear of men, but because I feared God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026">Job 31:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 31:26</a></font></span></p>If I beheld the (r) sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) If I was proud of my worldly prosperity and happiness, which is meant by the shining of the sun, and brightness of the moon.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#027">Job 31:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">job 31:27</a></font></span></p>And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my (s) hand:

 </p><p>(s) If my own doings delighted me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#028">Job 31:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 31:28</a></font></span></p>This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] (t) above. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) By putting confidence in anything but in him alone.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031">Job 31:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">job 31:31</a></font></span></p>If the men of my (u) tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

 </p><p>(x) Not confessed it freely, by which it is evident that he justified himself before men, and not before God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034">Job 31:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">job 31:34</a></font></span></p>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families (y) terrify me, that I kept (z) silence, [and] went not out of the door? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) That is, I reverenced the most weak and contemned and was afraid to offend them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(z) I suffered them to speak evil of me, and went not out of my house to avenge it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035">Job 31:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">job 31:35</a></font></span></p>Oh that one would hear me! behold, my (a) desire [is, that] the Almighty would answer me, and [that] mine adversary had written a book. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This is a sufficient token of my righteousness, that God is my witness and will justify my cause.

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Should not this book of his accusations be a praise and commendation to me?

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">job 31:37</a></font></span></p>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a (c) prince would I go near unto him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) I will make him account of all my life, without fear.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) As though I had withheld their wages that laboured in it.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, the talk which he had with his three friends.
