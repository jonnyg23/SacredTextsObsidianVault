 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001">Acts 11:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">act 11:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Peter, being reprehended without reason by the unskilful and ignorant, does not object and say that he should not be judged by any, but openly gives an account of his actions.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018">Acts 11:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 11:18</a></font></span></p>(2) When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Those who ask a question of the truth which they do not know, ought to be quietly heard, and must also quietly yield to the declaration of the truth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019">Acts 11:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">act 11:19</a></font></span></p>(3) Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and (a) Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The scattering abroad of Jerusalem is the cause of the gathering together of many other churches. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) He speaks of Antioch which was in Syria and bordered upon Cilicia.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020">Acts 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">act 11:20</a></font></span></p>(4) And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The church of Antioch, the new Jerusalem of the Gentiles, was extraordinarily called.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#022">Acts 11:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">act 11:22</a></font></span></p>(5) Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The apostles do not rashly condemn an extraordinary calling, but instead they judge it by the effects.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025">Acts 11:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">act 11:25</a></font></span></p>(6) Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) There was no contention amongst the apostles, either with regard to usurping, or with regard to holding places of degree.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027">Acts 11:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">act 11:27</a></font></span></p>(7) And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) God punishes his Church when he punishes the wicked, in his scourges and plagues which he sends upon the earth, in such a way that he nonetheless conveniently provides for it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029">Acts 11:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">act 11:29</a></font></span></p>(8) Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send (b) relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) All congregations or churches make one body. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, that the deacons might help the poor with it: for it was appropriate and helpful to have all these things done orderly and decently, and therefore it is said that they sent these things to the elders, that is, to the governors of the Church.
