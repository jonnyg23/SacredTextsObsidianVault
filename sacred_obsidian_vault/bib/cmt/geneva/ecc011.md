 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ecc 11:1</a></font></span></p>Cast thy bread upon the (a) waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, be liberal to the poor, and though it seems to be as a thing ventured on the sea, yet it will bring you profit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ecc 11:3</a></font></span></p>If the (b) clouds are full of rain, they empty [themselves] upon the earth: and if the (c) tree falleth toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As the clouds that are full pour out rain, so the rich that have abundance must distribute it liberally. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) He exhorts to be liberal while we live: for after, there is no power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004">Ecclesiastes 11:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ecc 11:4</a></font></span></p>He that observeth the (d) wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He who fears inconveniences when need requires will never do his duty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ecc 11:6</a></font></span></p>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening (e) withhold not thy hand: for thou knowest not which shall prosper, either this or (f) that, or whether they both [shall be] alike good. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Be not weary of well doing. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, which of your works are most agreeable to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 11:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ecc 11:8</a></font></span></p>But if a man shall live many years, [and] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of (g) darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh [is] vanity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, of affliction and trouble.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He derides them who set their desire in worldly pleasures as though God would not call count.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, anger and envy. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) Meaning, carnal lusts to which youth is given.
