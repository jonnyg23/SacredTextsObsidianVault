 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 10:1</a></font></span></p>Then Samuel took a vial of (a) oil, and poured [it] upon his head, and kissed him, and said, [Is it] not because the LORD hath anointed thee [to be] captain over his inheritance? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) In the Law this anointing signified the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which were necessary for those who would rule. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 10:2</a></font></span></p>When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The (b) asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Samuel confirms him by these signs, that God has appointed him king. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa1 10:5</a></font></span></p>After that thou shalt come to the (c) hill of God, where [is] the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was a high place in the city Kirjath-jearim, where the ark was, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002">Sa1 7:2</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 10:9</a></font></span></p>And it was [so], that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another (d) heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He gave him such virtues as were fitting for a king. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa1 10:12</a></font></span></p>And one of the same place answered and said, But who [is] their (e) father? Therefore it became a proverb, [Is] Saul also among the (f) prophets? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning, that prophecy comes not by succession, but is given to whom it pleases God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Noting by it him that from low degree comes suddenly to honour. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#017">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sa1 10:17</a></font></span></p>And Samuel (g) called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Both to declare to them their fault in asking a king, and also to show God's sentence in it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#020">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">sa1 10:20</a></font></span></p>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was (h) taken. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, by casting of lot. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#022">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">sa1 10:22</a></font></span></p>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he (i) hath hid himself among the stuff. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) As though he were unworthy and unwilling. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#025">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">sa1 10:25</a></font></span></p>Then Samuel told the people (k) the manner of the kingdom, and wrote [it] in a book, and laid [it] up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) As it is written in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015">Deu 17:15</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#027">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 10:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">sa1 10:27</a></font></span></p>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he (l) held his peace. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Both to avoid disputing and also to win them by patience.
