 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Reuben came from Leah, and Gad from Zilpah her handmaid. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Which was named for the heap of stones that Jacob made as a sign of the covenant between him and Laban in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#047">Gen 31:47</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Because they complained and would not believe their report, which told the truth concerning the land.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#015">Numbers 32:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">num 32:15</a></font></span></p>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and (d) ye shall destroy all this people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By your occasion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#017">Numbers 32:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">num 32:17</a></font></span></p>But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their (e) place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In the land of Canaan.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, the inhabitants of the land.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#022">Numbers 32:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">num 32:22</a></font></span></p>And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession (h) before the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The Lord will grant you this land which you request, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#015">Jos 1:15</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#023">Numbers 32:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">num 32:23</a></font></span></p>But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin (i) will find you out.
