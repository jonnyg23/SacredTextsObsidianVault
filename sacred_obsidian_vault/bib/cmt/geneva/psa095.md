 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001">Psalms 95:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 95:1</a></font></span></p>O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a (a) joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows that God's service stands not in dead ceremonies, but chiefly in the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003">Psalms 95:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 95:3</a></font></span></p>For the LORD [is] a great God, and a great King above all (b) gods. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Even the angels (who in respect to men are thought as gods) are nothing in his sight, much less the idols, which man's brain invents.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#004">Psalms 95:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 95:4</a></font></span></p>In his hand [are] the deep places of the earth: the (c) strength of the hills [is] his also. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) All things are governed by his providence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006">Psalms 95:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 95:6</a></font></span></p>O come, let us (d) worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By these three words he signifies one thing: meaning that they must wholly give themselves to serve God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007">Psalms 95:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 95:7</a></font></span></p>For he [is] our God; and we [are] the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his (e) hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, the flock whom he governs with his own hand. He shows how they are God's flock, that is, if they hear his voice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008">Psalms 95:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 95:8</a></font></span></p>(f) Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, [and] as [in] the day of temptation in the wilderness: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) By the contemning of God's word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010">Psalms 95:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 95:10</a></font></span></p>Forty years long was I grieved with [this] generation, and said, It [is] a people that do (g) err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) They were without judgment and reason.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011">Psalms 95:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 95:11</a></font></span></p>Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into (h) my rest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, into the land of Canaan, where he promised them rest.
