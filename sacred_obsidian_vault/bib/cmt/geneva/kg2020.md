 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#002">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg2 20:2</a></font></span></p>Then he turned his face to the (a) wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That his mind might not be troubled. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#003">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">kg2 20:3</a></font></span></p>I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a (b) perfect heart, and have done [that which is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah (c) wept sore. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, without all hypocrisy. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Not so much for his own death, as for fear that idolatry would be restored which he had destroyed, and so God's Name be dishonoured. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#005">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg2 20:5</a></font></span></p>Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy (d) prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the (e) house of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Because of his true repentance and prayer, God turned away his wrath. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) To give thanks for your deliverance. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#007">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">kg2 20:7</a></font></span></p>And Isaiah said, Take a (f) lump of figs. And they took and laid [it] on the boil, and he recovered. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He declares that though God can heal without other medicines, he will not have these inferior means contemned. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#010">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg2 20:10</a></font></span></p>And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow (g) return backward ten degrees. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Let the sun go so many degrees back, that the hours may be fewer in the king's dial. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">kg2 20:11</a></font></span></p>And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the (h) dial of Ahaz. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Which was set at the top of the stairs that Ahaz had made. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">kg2 20:12</a></font></span></p>At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a (i) present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Moved by the favour that God showed to Hezekiah, and also because he had declared himself an enemy of Sennacherib who was now destroyed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">kg2 20:13</a></font></span></p>And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and [all] the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his (k) dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Being moved by ambition and vain glory, and also because he seemed to rejoice in the friendship of him who was God's enemy and an infidel. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#019">4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">kg2 20:19</a></font></span></p>Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good [is] the word of the LORD which thou hast (l) spoken. And he said, [Is it] not [good], if (m) peace and truth be in my days? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) He acknowledges Isaiah to be the true prophet of God and therefore humbles himself to his word. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Seeing that God has shown me this favour to grant me quietness during my life: for he was afraid lest the enemies would have had opportunity to rejoice if the Church had decayed in his time, because he had restored religion.
