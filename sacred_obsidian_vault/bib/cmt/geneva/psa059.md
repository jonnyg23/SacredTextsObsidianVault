 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Or, a certain tune. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Though his enemies were even at hand to destroy him, yet he assures himself that God had ways to deliver him.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 59:3</a></font></span></p>For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not [for] my (c) transgression, nor [for] my sin, O LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) For I am innocent toward them, and have not offended them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005">Psalms 59:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 59:5</a></font></span></p>Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not (d) merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He compares their cruelty to hungry dogs showing that they are never weary in doing evil.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) They boast openly in their wicked devises, and every word is as a sword: for they neither fear God nor are ashamed of men.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though Saul has great power, yet I know that you bridle him: therefore I will patiently hope in you.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 59:10</a></font></span></p>The God of my mercy shall (h) prevent me: God shall let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He will not fail to help me when need requires.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011">Psalms 59:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 59:11</a></font></span></p>Slay them (i) not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Altogether, but little by little, that the people seeing your judgments often, may be mindful of you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012">Psalms 59:12</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That in their misery and shame they may be as glasses and examples of God's vengeance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#013">Psalms 59:13</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) When your time will come, and when they have sufficiently served for an example of your vengeance to others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014">Psalms 59:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 59:14</a></font></span></p>And at evening let them (m) return; [and] let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Who used the policy of a weak woman to confound the enemies strength, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#012">Sa1 19:12</a>).
