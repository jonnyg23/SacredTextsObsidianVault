 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#002">Job 39:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 39:2</a></font></span></p>Canst thou number the months [that] they (d) fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, how long they go with young?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#003">Job 39:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 39:3</a></font></span></p>They bow themselves, they (e) bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) They bring forth with great difficulty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#006">Job 39:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 39:6</a></font></span></p>Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the (f) barren land his dwellings.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Is it possible to make the unicorn tame? signifying that if man cannot rule a creature, that it is much more impossible that he should appoint the wisdom of God, by which he governs all the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014">Job 39:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 39:14</a></font></span></p>Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and (h) warmeth them in dust, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) They write that the ostrich covers her eggs in the sand, and because the country is hot and the sun still keeps them warm, they are hatched.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#016">Job 39:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 39:16</a></font></span></p>She is hardened against her young ones, as though [they were] not hers: her labour is (i) in vain without fear; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) If he should take care of them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017">Job 39:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 39:17</a></font></span></p>Because God hath deprived her of (k) wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, to have a care and natural affection toward his young.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#018">Job 39:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 39:18</a></font></span></p>What (l) time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) When the young ostrich is grown up, he outruns the horse.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019">Job 39:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 39:19</a></font></span></p>Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with (m) thunder? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, given him courage? which is meant by neighing and shaking his neck.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#021">Job 39:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 39:21</a></font></span></p>He (n) paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) He beats with his hoof.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#024">Job 39:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 39:24</a></font></span></p>He (o) swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that [it is] the sound of the trumpet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He so rides the ground that it seems nothing under him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#026">Job 39:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 39:26</a></font></span></p>Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, [and] stretch her wings toward the (p) south?
