 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, Christ, who in respect to his manhood is called here servant. The prophets used to make mention of Christ after they declared any great promise, because he is the foundation on which all the promises are made and ratified.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Only he is acceptable to me and they that come to me by him: for there is no other means of reconciliation, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018">Mat 12:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001">Eph 4:1</a>)

 <p>
 </p><p>(t) That is, my poor people, who are in perplexity and care.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019">Isaiah 42:19</a></p>
