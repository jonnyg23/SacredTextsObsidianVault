 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 24:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David [is] in the wilderness of (b) Engedi. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) A city of Judah, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062">Jos 15:62</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 24:4</a></font></span></p>And the men of David said unto him, (c) Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Here we see how ready we are to hasten God's promise, if the occasion serve never so little. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#005">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa1 24:5</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart (d) smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For seeing it was his own private cause, he repented that he had touched his enemy. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 24:9</a></font></span></p>And David said to Saul, (e) Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Contrary to the report of those who said David was Saul's enemy, he proves himself to be his friend. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">sa1 24:16</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, (f) [Is] this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though he was a cruel enemy to David, yet by his great gentleness his conscience compelled him to yield. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#020">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">sa1 24:20</a></font></span></p>And now, behold, I (g) know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though this tyrant saw and confessed the favour of God toward David, yet he did not cease to persecute him against his own conscience.
