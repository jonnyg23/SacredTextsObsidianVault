 <p>
 </p><p>(a) After they had passed Jordan. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Thus ambition envies God's work in others as they did against Gideon, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001">Jdg 8:1</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jdg 12:3</a></font></span></p>And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not, (c) I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, I ventured my life, and when man's help failed, I put my trust only in God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004">Judges 12:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jdg 12:4</a></font></span></p>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim (d) among the Ephraimites, [and] among the Manassites. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) You ran from us, and chose Gilead, and now in respect to us you are nothing.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006">Judges 12:6</a></p>

Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which signifies the fall of waters, or an ear of corn.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jdg 12:8</a></font></span></p>And after him (f) Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Some think that this was Boaz the husband of Ruth.
