 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001">Psalms 27:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 27:1</a></font></span></p>"[A Psalm] of David." The LORD [is] my (a) light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD [is] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because he was assured of good success in all his dangers and that his salvation was surely laid up in God, he did not fear the tyranny of his enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003">Psalms 27:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 27:3</a></font></span></p>Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in (b) this [will] I [be] confident. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That God will deliver me and give my faith the victory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004">Psalms 27:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 27:4</a></font></span></p>(c) One [thing] have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The loss of country, wife and all worldly conveniences would not grieve me as much as this one thing, that I may not praise your name in the midst of the congregation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006">Psalms 27:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 27:6</a></font></span></p>(d) And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) David assured himself by the Spirit of prophecy that he should overcome his enemies and serve God in his tabernacle.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008">Psalms 27:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 27:8</a></font></span></p>[When thou saidst], (e) Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He grounds on God's promise and shows that he is most willing to obey his commandment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010">Psalms 27:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 27:10</a></font></span></p>(f) When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He magnifies God's love toward his, which far passes the most tender love of parents towards their children.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012">Psalms 27:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 27:12</a></font></span></p>Deliver me not over unto the (g) will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) But either pacify their wrath, or bridle their rage.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013">Psalms 27:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 27:13</a></font></span></p>[I had fainted], unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD (h) in the land of the living. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In this present life before I die, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011">Isa 38:11</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014">Psalms 27:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 27:14</a></font></span></p>(i) Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He exhorts himself to depend on the Lord seeing he never failed in his promises.
