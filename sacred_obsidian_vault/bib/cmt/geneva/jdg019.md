 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#006">Judges 19:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jdg 19:6</a></font></span></p>And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the (a) damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, his concubines father.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#008">Judges 19:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jdg 19:8</a></font></span></p>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, (b) Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, that he should refresh himself with food, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#005">Jdg 19:5</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#009">Judges 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jdg 19:9</a></font></span></p>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go (c) home. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, to the town or city where he lived.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#012">Judges 19:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jdg 19:12</a></font></span></p>And his master said unto him, (d) We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that [is] not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Though in these days there were most horrible corruptions, even necessity could not compel them to associate with those who did not profess the true God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016">Judges 19:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jdg 19:16</a></font></span></p>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which [was] also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place [were] (e) Benjamites. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Or, the children of Jamini.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#018">Judges 19:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jdg 19:18</a></font></span></p>And he said unto him, We [are] passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence [am] I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I [am now] going to the (f) house of the LORD; and there [is] no man that receiveth me to house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) To Shiloh of Mizpeh where the ark was.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022">Judges 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jdg 19:22</a></font></span></p>[Now] as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, [and] (g) beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) In an attempt to break it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#024">Judges 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">jdg 19:24</a></font></span></p>Behold, [here is] my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, (h) and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, abuse them, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008">Gen 19:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#026">Judges 19:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">jdg 19:26</a></font></span></p>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and (i) fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord [was], till it was light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) She fell down dead, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#027">Jdg 19:27</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#028">Judges 19:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">jdg 19:28</a></font></span></p>And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her [up] upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his (k) place. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Meaning, home to mount Ephraim.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#030">Judges 19:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">jdg 19:30</a></font></span></p>And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no (l) such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak [your minds]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) For this was like the sin of Sodom for which God rained down fire and brimstone from heaven.
