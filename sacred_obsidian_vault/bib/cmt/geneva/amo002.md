 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001">Amos 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">amo 2:1</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he burned the (a) bones of the king of Edom into lime: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) For the Moabites were so cruel against the King of Edom, that they burnt his bones after he was dead: which declared their barbarous rage, that they would avenge themselves upon the dead.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004">Amos 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">amo 2:4</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, (b) I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Seeing that the Gentiles who did have as much knowledge were punished in this way, Judah which was so fully instructed by the Lord's will, should not think that they would escape.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006">Amos 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">amo 2:6</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of (c) Israel, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of (d) shoes; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) If he did not spare Judah unto whom his promises were made, much more he will not spare this degenerate kingdom. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) They esteemed most vile bribes more than men's lives.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007">Amos 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">amo 2:7</a></font></span></p>That pant after the (e) dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the [same] maid, to profane my holy name: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) When they have robbed him and thrown him to the ground, they open wide their mouths for his life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008">Amos 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">amo 2:8</a></font></span></p>And they lay [themselves] down upon clothes laid to pledge (f) by every altar, and they (g) drink the wine of the condemned [in] the house of their god. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Thinking that by these ceremonies, that is, by sacrificing, and by being near my altar, they may excuse all of their other wickedness. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) They rob others and offer it to God, thinking that he will exempt them, when he is made partaker of their iniquity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009">Amos 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">amo 2:9</a></font></span></p>Yet destroyed I the (h) Amorite before them, whose height [was] like the height of the cedars, and he [was] strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The destruction of their enemies and his mercy toward them, should have caused their hearts to melt because of love toward him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011">Amos 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">amo 2:11</a></font></span></p>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of (i) your young men for Nazarites. [Is it] not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) You condemned my benefits, and abused my graces, and craftily went about to stop the mouths of my Prophets.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013">Amos 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">amo 2:13</a></font></span></p>Behold, I am (k) pressed under you, as a cart is pressed [that is] full of sheaves. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) You have wearied me with your sins; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014">Isa 1:14</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014">Amos 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">amo 2:14</a></font></span></p>Therefore the flight shall perish from the (l) swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) None will be delivered by any means.
