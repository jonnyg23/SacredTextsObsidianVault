 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001">Isaiah 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 16:1</a></font></span></p>Send (a) ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, offer a sacrifice, by which he derides their long delay, who would not repent when the Lord called them, showing them that it is now too late seeing the vengeance of God is on them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002">Isaiah 16:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 16:2</a></font></span></p>For it shall be, [that], as a (b) wandering bird cast out of the nest, [so] the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) There is no remedy but that you must flee.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003">Isaiah 16:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 16:3</a></font></span></p>Take counsel, execute judgment; (c) make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; discover not him that wandereth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He shows what Moab would have done, when Israel their neighbour was in affliction, to whom because they would give no shadow or comfort, they are now left comfortless.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004">Isaiah 16:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 16:4</a></font></span></p>Let my outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner (d) is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The Assyrians will oppress the Israelites but for a while.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005">Isaiah 16:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 16:5</a></font></span></p>And in mercy shall the throne be established: (e) and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and swiftly executing righteousness.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Their vain confidence and proud bragging will deceive them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002">Jer 48:2</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 16:7</a></font></span></p>Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely [they are] (g) stricken. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For all your mourning, yet the city will be destroyed even to the foundation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008">Isaiah 16:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 16:8</a></font></span></p>For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah: (h) the lords of the nations have broken down her principal plants, they have come [even] to (i) Jazer, they wandered [through] the wilderness: her branches are extended, they have gone over the sea. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, the Assyrians and other enemies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning that the country of Moab was now destroyed, and all the precious things of it were carried into the borders yea into other countries and over the sea.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009">Isaiah 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 16:9</a></font></span></p>Therefore I will (k) bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy (l) harvest is fallen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He shows that their plague was so great that it would have moved any man to lament with them, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005">Psa 141:5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) The enemies are come upon you, and shout for joy when they carry your conveniences from you as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#033">Jer 48:33</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011">Isaiah 16:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 16:11</a></font></span></p>Wherefore my (m) heart shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) For sorrow and compassion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012">Isaiah 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 16:12</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his (n) sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) They will use all means to seek help for their idols, and all in vain: for Chemosh their great god will not be able to help them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014">Isaiah 16:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 16:14</a></font></span></p>But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, (o) Within three years, as the years of an (p) hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be despised, with all that great multitude; and the remnant [shall be] very small [and] feeble. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He appointed a certain time to punish the enemies in. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) Who will observe justly the time for which he is hired and serve no longer but will ever long for it.
