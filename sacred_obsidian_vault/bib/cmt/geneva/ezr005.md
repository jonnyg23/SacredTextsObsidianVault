 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ezr 5:2</a></font></span></p>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which [is] at Jerusalem: and with them [were] the prophets of God (a) helping them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who encouraged them to go forward, and cursed them because they were more careful to build their own houses, than zealous to build the temple of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004">Ezra 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ezr 5:4</a></font></span></p>(b) Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, the enemies asked this, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#010">Ezr 5:10</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005">Ezra 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ezr 5:5</a></font></span></p>But the (c) eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this [matter]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) His favour and the spirit of strength.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011">Ezra 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ezr 5:11</a></font></span></p>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a (d) great king of Israel builded and set up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, Solomon.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#013">Ezra 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ezr 5:13</a></font></span></p>But in the (e) first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon [the same] king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1,2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#014">Ezra 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ezr 5:14</a></font></span></p>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that [was] in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto [one], whose name [was] (f) Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008">Ezr 1:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017">Ezra 5:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ezr 5:17</a></font></span></p>Now therefore, if [it seem] good to the king, let there be search made in the king's (g) treasure house, which [is] there at Babylon, whether it be [so], that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
