 <p>
 </p><p>(f) You will instruct him what to say.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) By which he wrought the miracles.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021">Exodus 4:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">exo 4:21</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will (i) harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) By receiving my spirit and delivering him to Satan to increase his anger.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022">Exodus 4:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">exo 4:22</a></font></span></p>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel [is] my son, [even] my (k) firstborn:
