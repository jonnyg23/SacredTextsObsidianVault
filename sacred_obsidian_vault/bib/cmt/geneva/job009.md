 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002">Job 9:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 9:2</a></font></span></p>I know [it is] so of a truth: but how should man be (a) just with God? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Job here answers Eliphaz and Bildad's oration, touching the justice of God, and his innocency, confessing God to be infinite in justice and man to be nothing in respect.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003">Job 9:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 9:3</a></font></span></p>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a (b) thousand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Of a thousand things, which God could lay to his charge, man cannot answer him one.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006">Job 9:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 9:6</a></font></span></p>Which (c) shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He declares the infirmity of man, by the mighty and incomprehensible power that is in God, showing what he could do if he would set forth his power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009">Job 9:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 9:9</a></font></span></p>Which maketh (d) Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) These are the names of certain stars by which he means that all stars both known and unknown are at his appointment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011">Job 9:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 9:11</a></font></span></p>Lo, he goeth (e) by me, and I see [him] not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) I am not able to comprehend his works, which are common and daily before my eyes, much less in those things, which are hid and secret.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012">Job 9:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 9:12</a></font></span></p>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? (f) who will say unto him, What doest thou? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He shows that when God executes his power, he does it justly, as no one can control him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013">Job 9:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 9:13</a></font></span></p>[If] God (g) will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers (h) do stoop under him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God will not be appeased for anything that man can say for himself for his justification. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, all the reasons that men can lay to approve their cause.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014">Job 9:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 9:14</a></font></span></p>How much less shall I answer him, [and] choose out (i) my words [to reason] with him? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) How should I be able to answer him by eloquence? By which he notes his friends, who although they were eloquent in talk, did not believe in their hearts, that which they spoke.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015">Job 9:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 9:15</a></font></span></p>Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I (k) not answer, [but] I would make supplication to my judge. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Meaning, in his own opinion, signifying that man will sometimes flatter himself to be righteous which before God is an abomination.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016">Job 9:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 9:16</a></font></span></p>If I (l) had called, and he had answered me; [yet] would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) While I am in pain I cannot break forth into many inconveniences although I still know that God is just.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017">Job 9:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 9:17</a></font></span></p>For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds (m) without cause. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) I am not able to feel my sins so great, as I feel the weight of his plagues; and this he speaks to condemn his dullness and to justify God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019">Job 9:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 9:19</a></font></span></p>If [I speak] of strength, lo, [he is] (n) strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time [to plead]? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) After he has accused his own weakness, he continues to justify God and his power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020">Job 9:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 9:20</a></font></span></p>If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: (o) [if I say], I [am] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) If I stood in my own defence yet God would have just cause to condemn me if he examined my heart and conscience.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022">Job 9:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 9:22</a></font></span></p>This [is] one [thing], therefore I said [it], He destroyeth the (p) perfect and the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) If God punishes according to his justice, he will destroy them who are counted perfect as well as them that are wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023">Job 9:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 9:23</a></font></span></p>If the scourge (q) slay suddenly, he will (r) laugh at the trial of the innocent. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) That is, the wicked. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(r) This is spoken according to our apprehension, as though he would say, If God destroyed only the wicked, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#003">Job 5:3</a>), why would he allow the innocent to be so long tormented by them?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024">Job 9:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 9:24</a></font></span></p>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: (s) he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, [and] who (t) [is] he? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) That they cannot see to do justice. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(t) That can show the contrary?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027">Job 9:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">job 9:27</a></font></span></p>If (u) I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort [myself]: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) I think not to fall into these afflictions, but my sorrows bring me to these manifold infirmities, and my conscience condemns me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#029">Job 9:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">job 9:29</a></font></span></p>[If] I be wicked, why then (x) labour I in vain? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) Why does God not destroy me at once? thus he speaks according to the infirmity of the flesh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030">Job 9:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">job 9:30</a></font></span></p>If I wash (y) myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) Though I seem pure in my own eyes, yet all is but corruption before God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#031">Job 9:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">job 9:31</a></font></span></p>Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own (z) clothes shall abhor me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) Whatever I would use to cover my filthiness with, it would disclose me even more.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033">Job 9:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">job 9:33</a></font></span></p>Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, (a) [that] might lay his hand upon us both. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who might make an accord between God and me, speaking of impatience, and yet confessing God to be just in punishing him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035">Job 9:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">job 9:35</a></font></span></p>[Then] would I speak, and not fear him; (b) but [it is] not so with me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Signifying that God's judgments keep him in awe.
