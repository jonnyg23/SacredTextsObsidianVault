 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001">Psalms 47:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 47:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." O (a) clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Here is figured Christ to whom all his should give willing obedience, and who would show himself terrible to the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003">Psalms 47:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 47:3</a></font></span></p>He shall (b) subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He has made the Jews who were the keepers of the law and prophets, schoolmasters to the Gentiles, that they would with gladness obey them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004">Psalms 47:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 47:4</a></font></span></p>He shall choose (c) our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God has chosen us above all other nations, to enjoy a most glorious inheritance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005">Psalms 47:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 47:5</a></font></span></p>God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the (d) sound of a trumpet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He alludes to the trumpets that were blown at solemn feasts: but he further signifies the triumph of Christ and his glorious ascension into the heavens.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007">Psalms 47:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 47:7</a></font></span></p>For God [is] the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with (e) understanding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He requires that understanding be joined with singing, lest the Name of God be profaned with vain crying.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009">Psalms 47:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 47:9</a></font></span></p>The princes of the people are gathered together, [even] the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth [belong] unto God: he (f) is greatly exalted. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He praises God's highness, for that he joins the great princes of the world (whom he calls shields) to the fellowship of his Church.
