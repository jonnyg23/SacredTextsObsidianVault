 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001">Judges 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jdg 16:1</a></font></span></p>Then went Samson to (a) Gaza, and saw there an harlot, (b) and went in unto her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) One of the five chief cities of the Philistines. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, he lodged with her.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#005">Judges 16:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jdg 16:5</a></font></span></p>And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred (c) [pieces] of silver. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Of the value of a shekel, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015">Gen 23:15</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#009">Judges 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jdg 16:9</a></font></span></p>Now [there were] (d) men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when (e) it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Certain Philistines in a secret chamber. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) When fire comes near it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#010">Judges 16:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jdg 16:10</a></font></span></p>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now (f) tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though her deceit threatened his life, yet his affection so blinded him, that he could not beware.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#013">Judges 16:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jdg 16:13</a></font></span></p>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. (g) And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) It is impossible if we give place to our wicked affections, for eventually we will be destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#015">Judges 16:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jdg 16:15</a></font></span></p>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, (h) I love thee, when thine heart [is] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength [lieth]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) For Samson used to say "I love you".  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017">Judges 16:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jdg 16:17</a></font></span></p>That he told her all his (i) heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I [have been] a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Thus his immoderate affections toward a wicked woman caused him to lose God's excellent gifts, and become a slave to those whom he should have ruled.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#019">Judges 16:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jdg 16:19</a></font></span></p>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went (k) from him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Not for the loss of his hair, but for the contempt of the ordinance of God, which was the reason God departed from him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#022">Judges 16:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jdg 16:22</a></font></span></p>Howbeit the hair of his head began to (l) grow again after he was shaven. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Yet he did not regain his strength, till he had called on God and reconciled himself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025">Judges 16:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">jdg 16:25</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he (m) made them sport: and they set him between the pillars. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Thus by God's just judgments they are made slaves to infidels if they neglect their calling to defend the faithful.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028">Judges 16:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">jdg 16:28</a></font></span></p>And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once (n) avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) According to my calling which is to execute God's judgments on the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#030">Judges 16:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">jdg 16:30</a></font></span></p>And Samson said, (o) Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than [they] which he slew in his life. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He does not speak out of despair, but humbling himself for neglecting his office and the offence thereby given.
