This [shall be] a sign to the house of Israel.

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) By this he represented the idolatry and sin of the ten tribes (for Samaria was on his left hand from Babylon) and how they had remained in it three hundred and ninety years.

 <p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014">Ezekiel 4:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eze 4:14</a></font></span></p>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither hath (l) abominable flesh come into my mouth.
