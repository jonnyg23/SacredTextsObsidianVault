 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001">Titus 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">tit 3:1</a></font></span></p>Put (1) them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) He declares particularly and separately that which he said before generally, noting out certain main and principal duties which men owe to men, and especially subjects to their magistrates.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003">Titus 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">tit 3:3</a></font></span></p>(2) For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) He confirms again the former exhortation by propounding the free benefit of our regeneration, the symbol of which is our baptism. (Ed.)  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005">Titus 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">tit 3:5</a></font></span></p>Not by works of (a) righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the (b) Holy Ghost; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Literally, "of works which are done in righteousness": and this passage fully refutes the doctrine of meritorious works. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Which the power of the Holy Spirit works.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008">Titus 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">tit 3:8</a></font></span></p>(3) [This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain (c) good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Again with great earnestness emphasises how we ought to give ourselves to true godliness and avoid all vain questions, which serve to nothing but to cause strife and debate. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Give themselves earnestly to good works.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010">Titus 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">tit 3:10</a></font></span></p>(4) A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The ministers of the word must at once cast off heretics, that is, those who stubbornly and seditiously disquiet the Church, and will pay no attention to ecclesiastical admonitions.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012">Titus 3:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">tit 3:12</a></font></span></p>(5) When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) Last of all, he writes a word or two regarding personal matters, and commends certain men.
