 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001">Matthew 28:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mat 28:1</a></font></span></p>In (1) the (a) end of the sabbath, as it (b) began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Christ, having routed death in the tomb, rises by his own power, as the angel immediately witnesses. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) At the going out of the sabbath, that is, about daybreak after the Roman manner of telling time, which considers the natural day to be from the rising of the sun to the next sunrise: and not as the Hebrews, which count from evening to evening. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) When the morning of the first day after the sabbath began to dawn: and that first day is the same as that which we now call Sunday, or the Lord's day.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003">Matthew 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mat 28:3</a></font></span></p>His (c) countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The beams of his eyes, and by the figure of speech called synecdoche, this is understood as the countenance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005">Matthew 28:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mat 28:5</a></font></span></p>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not (d) ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The word "ye" is spoken with force to indicate that it was the women to whom he was speaking, as the soldiers were also afraid.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009">Matthew 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mat 28:9</a></font></span></p>(2) And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Christ himself appears after his resurrection, and sending the women to his disciples, shows that he has not forgotten them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#011">Matthew 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mat 28:11</a></font></span></p>(3) Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The more that the sun shines, the more that the wicked are blinded.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014">Matthew 28:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mat 28:14</a></font></span></p>And if this (e) come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For it was to be feared that it would be brought to the governor's ears.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016">Matthew 28:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">mat 28:16</a></font></span></p>(4) Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) Christ appears also to his disciples, whom he makes apostles.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019">Matthew 28:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mat 28:19</a></font></span></p>(5) Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them (f) in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The sum of the apostleship is the proclaiming of the doctrine received from Christ throughout all the world, and the ministering of the sacraments: the efficacy of which things depends not on the minsters but on the Lord. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Calling upon the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Matthew 28:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mat 28:20</a></font></span></p>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you (g) alway, [even] unto the end of the world. Amen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Forever: and this refers to the manner of the presence of his Spirit, by means of which he makes us partakers both of himself and of all his benefits, even though he is absent from us in body.
