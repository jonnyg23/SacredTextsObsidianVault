 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch1 18:1</a></font></span></p>Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took (a) Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001">Sa2 8:1</a>) calls the bridle of bondage, because it was a strong town and kept the country around it in subjection. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#006">1 Chronicles 18:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ch1 18:6</a></font></span></p>Then David put [garrisons] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the LORD (b) preserved David whithersoever he went. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is in all things that he attempted.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ch1 18:8</a></font></span></p>Likewise from (c) Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008">Sa2 8:8</a>) is called Betah and Berothai.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch1 18:10</a></font></span></p>He sent (d) Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and [with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Called also Joram (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010">Sa2 8:10</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Because the Edomites and the Syrians joined their power together, it is said, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012">Sa2 8:12</a>) that the Amramites were spoiled. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012">1 Chronicles 18:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch1 18:12</a></font></span></p>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt (f) eighteen thousand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which is understood that Joab slew 12,000 as is in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001">Psa 60:1</a>) and Abishai the rest.
