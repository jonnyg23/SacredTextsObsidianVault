 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 35:8</a></font></span></p>Let destruction come upon (f) him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into (g) that very destruction let him fall. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) When he promises peace to himself. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) Which he prepared against the children of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010">Psalms 35:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 35:10</a></font></span></p>All my (h) bones shall say, LORD, who [is] like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He attributes his deliverance only to God, praising him therefore both in soul and body.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#011">Psalms 35:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 35:11</a></font></span></p>(i) False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge [things] that I knew not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That would not permit me to purge myself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012">Psalms 35:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 35:12</a></font></span></p>They rewarded me evil for good [to] the (k) spoiling of my soul. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) To have taken from me all comfort and brought me into despair.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013">Psalms 35:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 35:13</a></font></span></p>But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing [was] sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and (l) my prayer returned into mine own bosom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) I prayed for them with inward affection, as I would have done for myself: or, I declared my affection with bowing down my head.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015">Psalms 35:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 35:15</a></font></span></p>But in mine (m) adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: [yea], the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew [it] not; they did tear (n) [me], and ceased not: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) When they thought me ready to slip and as one that limped for infirmity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) With their railing words.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#016">Psalms 35:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 35:16</a></font></span></p>With hypocritical mockers in (o) feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) The word signifies cakes: meaning that the proud courtiers at their dainty feasts scoff, rail, and conspire his death.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019">Psalms 35:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 35:19</a></font></span></p>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: [neither] let them (p) wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) In token of contempt and mocking.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021">Psalms 35:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">psa 35:21</a></font></span></p>Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, [and] said, Aha, aha, (q) our eye hath seen [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) They rejoiced as though they had now seen David overthrown.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024">Psalms 35:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">psa 35:24</a></font></span></p>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy (r) righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) It is the justice of God to give to the oppressors affliction and torment, and to the oppressed aid and relief, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006">Th2 1:6</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025">Psalms 35:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">psa 35:25</a></font></span></p>Let them not say in their hearts, (s) Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Because we have that which we sought for, seeing he is destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026">Psalms 35:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">psa 35:26</a></font></span></p>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion (t) together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed (u) with shame and dishonour that magnify [themselves] against me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) That is, at once, were they never so many or mighty. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(u) This prayer will always be verified against them who persecute the faithful.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027">Psalms 35:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">psa 35:27</a></font></span></p>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, (x) that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the (y) prosperity of his servant. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) That at least favour my right, though they are not able to help me. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(y) He exhorts the Church to praise God for the deliverance of his servants, and for the destruction of his adversaries.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001">Psalms 35:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 35:1</a></font></span></p>"[A Psalm] of David." Plead [my (a) cause], O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He desires God to undertake his cause against them who persecute him and slander him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#002">Psalms 35:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 35:2</a></font></span></p>(b) Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Even though God can with his breath destroy all his enemies, yet the Holy Spirit attributes to him these outward weapons to assure us of his patient power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003">Psalms 35:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 35:3</a></font></span></p>Draw out also the spear, and stop [the way] against them that persecute me: say unto my (c) soul, I [am] thy salvation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Assure me against these temptations, that you are the author of my salvation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#005">Psalms 35:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 35:5</a></font></span></p>Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD (d) chase [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Smite them with the spirit of giddiness that their enterprises may be foolish, and they received just reward.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#007">Psalms 35:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 35:7</a></font></span></p>For (e) without cause have they hid for me their net [in] a pit, [which] without cause they have digged for my soul. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Showing that we may not call God to be a revenger but only for his glory, and when our cause is just.
