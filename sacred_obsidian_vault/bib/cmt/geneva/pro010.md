 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 10:2</a></font></span></p>Treasures of (a) wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, wickedly gotten.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003">Proverbs 10:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pro 10:3</a></font></span></p>The LORD will (b) not allow the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Though he permits the just to want for a time, yet he will send him comfort in due season.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006">Proverbs 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">pro 10:6</a></font></span></p>Blessings [are] upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of (c) the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) When their wickedness is discovered, they will be as dumb and not know what to say.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007">Proverbs 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">pro 10:7</a></font></span></p>The memory of the just [is] blessed: but the name of the wicked shall (d) perish. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Shall be vile and abhorred both by God and man, contrary to their own expectation, who think to make their name immortal.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010">Proverbs 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 10:10</a></font></span></p>He that (e) winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a (f) prating fool shall fall. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That bears a fair countenance and imagines mischief in his heart, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013">Pro 6:13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) For the corruption of his heart is known by his talk.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 10:13</a></font></span></p>In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but (g) a rod [is] for the back of him that is void of understanding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, God will find him out to punish him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015">Proverbs 10:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pro 10:15</a></font></span></p>The rich man's wealth [is] his (h) strong city: the destruction of the poor [is] their poverty. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) And so makes him bold to do evil, while poverty bridles the poor from many evil things.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021">Proverbs 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 10:21</a></font></span></p>The lips of the righteous (i) feed many: but fools die for lack of wisdom.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026">Proverbs 10:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">pro 10:26</a></font></span></p>As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so [is] the sluggard to them that (l) send him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) He is trouble and grief to him about any business.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027">Proverbs 10:27</a></p>
