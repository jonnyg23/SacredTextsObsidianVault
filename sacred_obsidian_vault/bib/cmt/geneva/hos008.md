 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001">Hosea 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 8:1</a></font></span></p>[Set] the trumpet to thy (a) mouth. [He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) God encourages the Prophet to signify the speedy coming of the enemy against Israel, which was once the people of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002">Hosea 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 8:2</a></font></span></p>Israel shall (b) cry unto me, My God, we know thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) They will cry like hypocrites, but not from the heart, as their deeds declare.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004">Hosea 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">hos 8:4</a></font></span></p>They have set up (c) kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, Jeroboam, by whom they sought their own liberty, and to obey my will.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005">Hosea 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">hos 8:5</a></font></span></p>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long [will it be] ere they attain to (d) innocency? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, upright judgment and a godly life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006">Hosea 8:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">hos 8:6</a></font></span></p>(e) For from Israel [was] it also: the workman made it; therefore it [is] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning the calf was invented by themselves, and by their fathers in the wilderness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007">Hosea 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">hos 8:7</a></font></span></p>For they have (f) sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Showing that their religion has but a show, and in itself is but vanity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009">Hosea 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">hos 8:9</a></font></span></p>For they are gone up to Assyria, a (g) wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) They never cease, but run to and fro to seek help.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010">Hosea 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">hos 8:10</a></font></span></p>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the (h) burden of the king of princes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, for the king and the princes will lay upon them: and by this means the Lord brings them to repentance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012">Hosea 8:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">hos 8:12</a></font></span></p>I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as a (i) strange thing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) In this way the idolaters consider the word of God as strange with regard to their own invention.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013">Hosea 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">hos 8:13</a></font></span></p>They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat [it; but] the (k) LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Saying that they offer it to the Lord, but he accepts no service which he himself has not appointed.
