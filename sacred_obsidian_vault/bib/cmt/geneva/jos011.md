 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 11:2</a></font></span></p>And to the kings that [were] on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of (b) Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Which the evangelists call the lake of Gennesaret, or Tiberias.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was mount Sion, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#048">Deu 4:48</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jos 11:6</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt (d) hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That neither they should serve to the use of war, nor the Israelites should put their trust in them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008">Joshua 11:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jos 11:8</a></font></span></p>And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto (e) Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which signifies hot waters, or according to some, brine pits.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jos 11:11</a></font></span></p>And they smote all the (f) souls that [were] therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them]: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Both men, women and children.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jos 11:13</a></font></span></p>But [as for] the cities that stood still in their (g) strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; [that] did Joshua burn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Which were strong by situation and not hurt by war.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#014">Joshua 11:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jos 11:14</a></font></span></p>And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every (h) man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) All mankind.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, Samaria.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017">Joshua 11:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 11:17</a></font></span></p>[Even] from the mount (k) Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) So called, because it was bare and without trees.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#020">Joshua 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jos 11:20</a></font></span></p>For it was of the LORD to (l) harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, [and] that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, to give them over to themselves: and therefore they could not but rebel against God and seek their own destruction.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jos 11:22</a></font></span></p>There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, (m) in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
