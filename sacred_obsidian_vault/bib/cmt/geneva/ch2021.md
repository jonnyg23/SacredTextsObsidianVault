 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002">2 Chronicles 21:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch2 21:2</a></font></span></p>And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these [were] the sons of Jehoshaphat king of (a) Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017">Ch2 15:17</a>) how by Israel he meant Judah. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004">2 Chronicles 21:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch2 21:4</a></font></span></p>Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and (b) slew all his brethren with the sword, and [divers] also of the princes of (c) Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Because the wicked always live in fear, and also are ambitious, they become cruel and spare not to murder them, whom by nature they ought most to cherish and defend. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning, of Judah and Benjamin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006">2 Chronicles 21:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ch2 21:6</a></font></span></p>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to (d) wife: and he wrought [that which was] evil in the eyes of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) So that we see how it cannot be that we should join with the wicked and serve God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#010">2 Chronicles 21:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch2 21:10</a></font></span></p>So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time [also] did (e) Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#022">Kg2 8:22</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011">2 Chronicles 21:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ch2 21:11</a></font></span></p>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit (f) fornication, and compelled Judah [thereto]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning, idolatry because the idolater breaks promise with God as the adulteress does to her husband. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012">2 Chronicles 21:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch2 21:12</a></font></span></p>And there came a writing to him from (g) Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Some think that this was Elisha so called because he had the Spirit in abundance, as had Elijah. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#015">2 Chronicles 21:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ch2 21:15</a></font></span></p>And thou [shalt have] great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until (h) thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) We see this example daily practised on them who fall away from God, and become idolaters and murderers of their brethren. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016">2 Chronicles 21:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ch2 21:16</a></font></span></p>Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that [were] near the (l) Ethiopians: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) There were other Arabians in Africa southward toward Egypt. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017">2 Chronicles 21:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ch2 21:17</a></font></span></p>And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save (k) Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Called also Ahaziah, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001">Ch2 22:1</a>) or Azariah in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#006">Ch2 22:6</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020">2 Chronicles 21:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">ch2 21:20</a></font></span></p>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, (l) and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, as some write, he was not regarded but deposed for his wickedness and idolatry so that his son reigned 22 years (his father yet living) without honour, and after his father's death he was confirmed to reign still, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002">Ch2 22:2</a>).
