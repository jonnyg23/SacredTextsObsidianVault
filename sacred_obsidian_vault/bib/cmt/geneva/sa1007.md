 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 7:1</a></font></span></p>And the men of (a) Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) A city in the tribe of Judah, called also Kirjathbaal, in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060">Jos 15:60</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 7:2</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented (b) after the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Lamented for their sins, and followed the Lord.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 7:6</a></font></span></p>And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and (d) drew water, and poured [it] out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 7:8</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to (e) cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) According to the prophecy of Hannah Samuel's mother, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010">Sa1 2:10</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa1 7:12</a></font></span></p>Then Samuel took a stone, and set [it] between Mizpeh and (g) Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us. 
 <p>

And there was peace between Israel and the (h) Amorites. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning, the Philistines. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sa1 7:17</a></font></span></p>And his return [was] to Ramah; for there [was] his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an (i) altar unto the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Which was not contrary to the Law: for as yet a certain place was not appointed.
