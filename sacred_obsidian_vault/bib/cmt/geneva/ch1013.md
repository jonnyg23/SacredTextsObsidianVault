 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003">1 Chronicles 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch1 13:3</a></font></span></p>And let us bring again the (a) ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) His first concern was to restore religion, which had in Saul's day been corrupted and neglected. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005">1 Chronicles 13:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch1 13:5</a></font></span></p>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from (b) Kirjathjearim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, from Gibea, where the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim had placed it in the house of Abinadab, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003">Sa2 6:3</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#007">1 Chronicles 13:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ch1 13:7</a></font></span></p>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio (c) drave the cart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The sons of Abinadab. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008">1 Chronicles 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ch1 13:8</a></font></span></p>And David and all Israel played before (d) God with all [their] might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, before the Ark, where God showed himself: so that the sign is taken for the thing signified, which is common to all sacraments both in the old and new testaments. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#009">1 Chronicles 13:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch1 13:9</a></font></span></p>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of (e) Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Called also Nachon, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006">Sa2 6:6</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010">1 Chronicles 13:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch1 13:10</a></font></span></p>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died (f) before God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Before the Ark for usurping that which did not belong to his calling: for this charge was given to the priests, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015">Num 4:15</a>), so that here all good intentions are condemned, unless they are commanded by the word of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#013">1 Chronicles 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ch1 13:13</a></font></span></p>So David brought not the ark [home] to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of (g) Obededom the Gittite. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Who was a Levite, and called Gittite, because he dwelt at Gath.
