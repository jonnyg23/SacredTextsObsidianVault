 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg1 15:2</a></font></span></p>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of (a) Abishalom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Some think that this was Absalom Solomon's son. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg1 15:4</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a (b) lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, a son to reign over Judah. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg1 15:10</a></font></span></p>And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his (c) mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, his grandmother, as David is often called the father of those who are his grandchildren. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">kg1 15:13</a></font></span></p>And also Maachah his mother, even her he (d) removed from [being] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt [it] by the brook Kidron. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Neither kindred nor authority should be regarded when they blaspheme God and become idolaters, but must be punished. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg1 15:14</a></font></span></p>But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was (e) perfect with the LORD all his days. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Though he permitted them to worship God in other places than he had appointed it came from ignorance, and not from malice. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg1 15:17</a></font></span></p>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built (f) Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For the same reason that Jeroboam did, because the people should not go up to Jerusalem, least they follow Asa. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">kg1 15:19</a></font></span></p>[There is] a league between me and thee, [and] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may (g) depart from me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) And vex me no longer. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">kg1 15:23</a></font></span></p>The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his (h) feet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He had gout and put his trust physicians rather than in the Lord, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012">Ch2 16:12</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">kg1 15:24</a></font></span></p>And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his (i) father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) His great-grandfather. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">kg1 15:29</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when he reigned, [that] he (k) smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) So God stirred up one tyrant to punish the wickedness of another. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#030">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">kg1 15:30</a></font></span></p>Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his (l) provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) By causing the people to commit idolatry with his calves, and so provoking God to anger. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033">3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">kg1 15:33</a></font></span></p>In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in (m) Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Which was the place where the kings of Israel remained.
