 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011">Jeremiah 20:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 20:11</a></font></span></p>(g) But the LORD [is] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: [their] everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Here he shows how his faith strove against temptation and sought the Lord for strength.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014">Jeremiah 20:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 20:14</a></font></span></p>(h) Cursed [be] the day in which I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) How the children of God are overcome in this battle of the flesh and the Spirit, and into what inconveniences they fall till God raises them up again: read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001">Job 3:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010">Jer 15:10</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016">Jeremiah 20:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jer 20:16</a></font></span></p>And let that man be as the (i) cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Alluding to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025">Gen 19:25</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017">Jeremiah 20:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jer 20:17</a></font></span></p>Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my grave, and she had not been (k) delivered. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Meaning that the fruit of it might never come to profit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002">Jeremiah 20:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 20:2</a></font></span></p>Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the (a) stocks that [were] in the high gate of Benjamin, which [was] by the house of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Thus we see that the thing which neither the king nor the princes nor the people dared to undertake against the prophet of God, this priest as a chief instrument of Satan first attempted, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018">Jer 18:18</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006">Jeremiah 20:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 20:6</a></font></span></p>And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy (b) friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Who have allowed themselves to be abused by your false prophecies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007">Jeremiah 20:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 20:7</a></font></span></p>O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was (c) deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast (d) prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) In this appears the impatiency which often overcomes the servants of God when they do not see their labours profit, and also feel their own weakness. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018">Jer 15:18</a> 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) You thrust me forth to this work against my will.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008">Jeremiah 20:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 20:8</a></font></span></p>For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and (e) spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows that he did his office in that he reproved the people of their vices and threatened them with God's judgments: but because he was derided and persecuted for this, he was discouraged, and would have stopped preaching, except that God's spirit forced him to it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010">Jeremiah 20:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 20:10</a></font></span></p>For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. (f) Report, [say they], and we will report it. All my friends watched for my fall, [saying], Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Thus the enemies conferred together to know what they had heard him say, that they might accuse him of it, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021">Isa 29:21</a>).
