 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001">Psalms 111:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 111:1</a></font></span></p>(a) Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with [my] whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and [in] the congregation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The prophet declares that he will praise God both privately and openly, and that from the heart, as he who consecrates himself wholly and only to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002">Psalms 111:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 111:2</a></font></span></p>The works of the LORD [are] (b) great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He shows that God's works are a sufficient reason for us to praise him, but chiefly his benefits toward his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005">Psalms 111:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 111:5</a></font></span></p>He hath given (c) meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God has given to his people all that was necessary for them and will do so even for his covenant's sake, and in this sense the Hebrew word is taken in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008">Pro 30:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#015">Pro 31:15</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007">Psalms 111:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 111:7</a></font></span></p>The (d) works of his hands [are] verity and judgment; all his commandments [are] sure. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) As God proposed to take care of his Church so in effect does he declare himself just and true in the government of the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010">Psalms 111:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 111:10</a></font></span></p>(e) The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that (f) do [his commandments]: his praise endureth for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) They only are wise who fear God and none have understanding but they who obey the word. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, his commandment as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007">Psa 111:7</a>).
