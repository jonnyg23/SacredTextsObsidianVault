 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 141:5</a></font></span></p>Let the righteous smite me; [it shall be] a kindness: and let (e) him reprove me; [it shall be] an excellent oil, [which] shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also [shall be] in their calamities. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He could abide all corrections that came from a loving heart.
