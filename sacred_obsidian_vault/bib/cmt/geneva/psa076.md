 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001">Psalms 76:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 76:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm [or] Song of Asaph." In Judah [is] God (a) known: his name [is] great in Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He declares that God's power is evidently seen in preserving his people and destroying his enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002">Psalms 76:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 76:2</a></font></span></p>In (b) Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Which later was called Jerusalem.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004">Psalms 76:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 76:4</a></font></span></p>Thou [art] more glorious [and] excellent than (c) the mountains of prey. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He compares the kingdom full of extortion and rapine to the mountains that are full of ravening beasts.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005">Psalms 76:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 76:5</a></font></span></p>The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have (d) found their hands. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) God has taken their spirits and strength from them as though their hands were cut off.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007">Psalms 76:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 76:7</a></font></span></p>Thou, [even] thou, [art] to be feared: and who may stand in thy (e) sight when once thou art angry? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) God with a look is able to destroy all the power and activity of the enemies, no matter how many or mighty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#009">Psalms 76:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 76:9</a></font></span></p>When God arose to judgment, to (f) save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) To avenge the wrongs done to your Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010">Psalms 76:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 76:10</a></font></span></p>Surely the (g) wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For the end will show that the enemy was able to bring nothing to pass: also you will bridle their rage that they will not accomplish their purpose.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011">Psalms 76:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 76:11</a></font></span></p>Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be (h) round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, the Levites who dwell about the Tabernacle, or the people among whom he dwells.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012">Psalms 76:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 76:12</a></font></span></p>He shall (i) cut off the spirit of princes: [he is] terrible to the kings of the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) The Hebrew word signifies "to vintage or gather grapes" meaning that he will make the counsels and enterprises of the wicked tyrants foolish and vain.
