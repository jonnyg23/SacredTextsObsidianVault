 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004">Numbers 11:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 11:4</a></font></span></p>And the mixt (a) multitude that [was] among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which were of those strangers that came out of Egypt with them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038">Exo 12:38</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005">Numbers 11:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 11:5</a></font></span></p>We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt (c) freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) For a final price, or good cheap.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006">Numbers 11:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 11:6</a></font></span></p>But now our soul [is] (d) dried away: [there is] nothing at all, beside this manna, [before] our eyes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For the greedy lust of flesh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#007">Numbers 11:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 11:7</a></font></span></p>And the manna [was] as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of (e) bdellium. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which is a white pearl, or precious stone.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#011">Numbers 11:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">num 11:11</a></font></span></p>And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found (f) favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Or, how have I displeased you?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012">Numbers 11:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 11:12</a></font></span></p>Have I (g) conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the (h) land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Am I their father, that no one may have charge of them but I? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) Of Canaan promised by another to our fathers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#015">Numbers 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">num 11:15</a></font></span></p>And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy (i) sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) I would rather die than see my grief and misery daily increased by their rebellion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017">Numbers 11:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">num 11:17</a></font></span></p>And I will come down and talk with thee there: (k) and I will take of the spirit which [is] upon thee, and will put [it] upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear [it] not thyself alone. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) I will distribute my spirit among them, as I have done to you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#018">Numbers 11:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">num 11:18</a></font></span></p>And say thou unto the people, (l) Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for [it was] well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Prepare yourselves that you may be clean.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#020">Numbers 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">num 11:20</a></font></span></p>[But] even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have (m) despised the LORD which [is] (n) among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Or, cast him off, because you refused manna, which he appointed as most suitable for you. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Who leads and governs you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#021">Numbers 11:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">num 11:21</a></font></span></p>And Moses said, The people, (o) among whom I [am], [are] six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Of whom I have charge.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025">Numbers 11:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">num 11:25</a></font></span></p>And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that [was] upon him, and gave [it] unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, [that], when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not (p) cease. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) From that day the spirit of prophecy did not settle them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028">Numbers 11:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">num 11:28</a></font></span></p>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, [one] of his (q) young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, (r) forbid them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Or, a young man whom he had chosen from his youth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(r) Such blind zeal was in the apostles, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038">Mar 9:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044">Luk 9:44</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#032">Numbers 11:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">num 11:32</a></font></span></p>And the people stood up all that day, and all [that] night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten (s) homers: and they spread [them] all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Of Homer, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016">Lev 27:16</a>) also it signifies a heap, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#014">Exo 8:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#016">Jdg 15:16</a>).
