 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">deu 5:3</a></font></span></p>The LORD (a) made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, [even] us, who [are] all of us here alive this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Some read, God made not this covenant, that is, in such ample forth and with such signs and wonders.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#004">Deuteronomy 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">deu 5:4</a></font></span></p>The LORD talked with you (b) face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) So plainly that you do not need to doubt it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#007">Deuteronomy 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">deu 5:7</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt have none (c) other gods before me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God binds us to serve him only without superstition and idolatry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009">Deuteronomy 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 5:9</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a (d) jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, of his honour, not permitting it to be given to others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#010">Deuteronomy 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 5:10</a></font></span></p>And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that (e) love me and keep my commandments. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The first degree to keep the commandments, is to love God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#013">Deuteronomy 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">deu 5:13</a></font></span></p>Six days (f) thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning, since God permits six days for our labours, we should willingly dedicate the seventh to serve him wholly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016">Deuteronomy 5:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">deu 5:16</a></font></span></p>(g) Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Not for a show, but with true obedience, and due reverence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#021">Deuteronomy 5:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">deu 5:21</a></font></span></p>Neither shalt (h) thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or any [thing] that [is] thy neighbour's. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He not only speaks of that resolute will, but that there should be no motion or affection.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022">Deuteronomy 5:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">deu 5:22</a></font></span></p>These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he (i) added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Teaching us by his example to be content with his word, and add nothing to it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#029">Deuteronomy 5:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">deu 5:29</a></font></span></p>O (k) that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He requires nothing but obedience from us, showing also that we ourselves are the unveiling of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#032">Deuteronomy 5:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">deu 5:32</a></font></span></p>Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not (l) turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) You shall neither add nor take away, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002">Deu 4:2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#033">Deuteronomy 5:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">deu 5:33</a></font></span></p>Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may (m) live, and [that it may be] well with you, and [that] ye may prolong [your] days in the land which ye shall possess. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) In the same way that God, by way of our obedience, gives us all happiness: so from disobeying God proceed all our miseries.
