 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lev 18:3</a></font></span></p>After the (a) doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) You shall preserve yourselves from these abominations following, which the Egyptians and Canaanites use.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Leviticus 18:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">lev 18:5</a></font></span></p>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: (b) I [am] the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) And therefore you ought to serve me alone, as my people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006">Leviticus 18:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">lev 18:6</a></font></span></p>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to (c) uncover [their] nakedness: I [am] the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, to lie with her, though it be under title of marriage.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008">Leviticus 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">lev 18:8</a></font></span></p>The nakedness of thy father's (d) wife shalt thou not uncover: it [is] thy father's nakedness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Which is your stepmother.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009">Leviticus 18:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">lev 18:9</a></font></span></p>The nakedness of thy (e) sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, [whether she be] born at home, or born abroad, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Either by father or mother, born in marriage or otherwise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#010">Leviticus 18:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">lev 18:10</a></font></span></p>The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs [is] thine own (f) nakedness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) They are her children whose shame you have uncovered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#014">Leviticus 18:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lev 18:14</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy (g) father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she [is] thine aunt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Which your uncle discovers.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">lev 18:16</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy (h) brother's wife: it [is] thy brother's nakedness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Because the idolaters, among whom God's people had dwelt and would dwell, were given to these horrible incests, God charges his own to beware of them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018">Leviticus 18:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">lev 18:18</a></font></span></p>Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to (i) vex [her], to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life [time]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) By seeing your affection more bent to her sister than to her.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019">Leviticus 18:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">lev 18:19</a></font></span></p>Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put (k) apart for her uncleanness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Or while she has her period.

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which was an idol of the Ammonites, to whom they burned and sacrificed their children, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010">Kg2 23:10</a>). This seemed to be the chief and principal of all idols: and as the Jews write, was of a great stature, and hollow within, having seven places or chambers within him: one was to receive meal that was offered: another turtle doves: the third, a sheep: the fourth, a ram: the fifth a calf: the sixth an ox: the seventh a child. This idols face was like a calf: his hands were ever stretched out to receive gifts: his priests were called Chemarims, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005">Kg2 23:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005">Hos 10:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004">Zep 1:4</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">lev 18:25</a></font></span></p>And the land is defiled: therefore I do (m) visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself (n) vomiteth out her inhabitants. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) I will punish the land where such incestuous marriages and pollutions are tolerated. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) He compares the wicked to evil humours and overeating, which corrupt the stomach, and oppress nature, and therefore must be cast out by vomit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028">Leviticus 18:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">lev 18:28</a></font></span></p>That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it (o) spued out the nations that [were] before you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Both for their wicked marriages, unnatural copulations, idolatry or spiritual whoredom with Molech and such like abominations.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029">Leviticus 18:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">lev 18:29</a></font></span></p>For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit [them] shall (p) be cut off from among their people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Either by the civil sword or by some plague that God will send upon such.
