 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">deu 22:1</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and (a) hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Showing that brotherly affection must be shown, not only to those who dwell near to us, but also to those who are far off.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For that alters the order of nature, and shows that you despise God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006">Deuteronomy 22:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 22:6</a></font></span></p>If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, [whether they be] young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, (e) thou shalt not take the dam with the young: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) If God detests cruelty done to little birds, how much more to man, made according to his image?

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 22:9</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not (f) sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The tenor of this law is to walk in simplicity and not to be curious about new fads.

And they shall spread the (h) cloth before the elders of the city.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) For the fault of the child becomes the shame of the parents: therefore he was recompensed when she was faultless.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#026">Deuteronomy 22:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">deu 22:26</a></font></span></p>But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; [there is] in the damsel no sin [worthy] of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so (k) [is] this matter:
