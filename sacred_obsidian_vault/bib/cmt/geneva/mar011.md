 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#009">Mark 11:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mar 11:9</a></font></span></p>And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; (a) Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord:

 </p><p>(a) Let it be well to him that comes to us from God, or that is sent from God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#010">Mark 11:10</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mar 11:13</a></font></span></p>(2) And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not [yet]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) An example of that vengeance which hangs over the heads of hypocrites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015">Mark 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">mar 11:15</a></font></span></p>(3) And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Christ shows that he is indeed the true King and high Priest, and therefore the one who takes revenge upon those who do not show proper reverence for the holy function of the temple.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, any profane instrument (of which those men had many) that made the court of the temple a marketplace.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017">Mark 11:17</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Will openly be considered and taken to be so.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020">Mark 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mar 11:20</a></font></span></p>(4) And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The power of faith is exceedingly great, and charity is always joined with it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022">Mark 11:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mar 11:22</a></font></span></p>And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have (e) faith in God.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mar 11:24</a></font></span></p>Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that (f) ye receive [them], and ye shall have [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Literally, "that you receive it", speaking in the present tense, to show the certainty of the thing, and that it will indeed be performed.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mar 11:25</a></font></span></p>And when (g) ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) When you will appear before the altar.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027">Mark 11:27</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The gospel has been assaulted long since then by those in positions of human authority.
