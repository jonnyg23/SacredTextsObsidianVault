 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001">Psalms 42:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 42:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, Maschil, (a) for the sons of Korah." As the hart (b) panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) As a treasure to be kept by them, who were of the number of the Levites. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) By these comparisons of the thirst and panting, he shows his fervent desire to serve God in his temple.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003">Psalms 42:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 42:3</a></font></span></p>(c) My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where [is] thy God? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) As others take pleasure in eating and drinking, so he was altogether given to weeping.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004">Psalms 42:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 42:4</a></font></span></p>When I remember (d) these [things], I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, how I led the people to serve you in your tabernacle, and now seeing my contrary estate, I die for sorrow.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005">Psalms 42:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 42:5</a></font></span></p>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and [why] art thou disquieted in me? (e) hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him [for] the help of his countenance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Though he sustained grievous assaults of the flesh to cast him into despair, yet his faith grounded on God's accustomed mercies gets the victory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006">Psalms 42:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 42:6</a></font></span></p>O my God, my soul is cast down within me: (f) therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, when I remember you in this land of my banishment among the mountains.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007">Psalms 42:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 42:7</a></font></span></p>(g) Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Afflictions came so thick upon me that I felt overwhelmed: by which he shows there is no end to our misery till God is pacified and sends help.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008">Psalms 42:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 42:8</a></font></span></p>[Yet] the LORD (h) will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song [shall be] with me, [and] my prayer unto the God of my life. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He assures himself of God's help in time to come.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010">Psalms 42:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 42:10</a></font></span></p>[As] with a sword in my (i) bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where [is] thy God? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, I am most grievously tormented.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011">Psalms 42:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 42:11</a></font></span></p>(k) Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the health of my countenance, and my God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) This repetition declares that David did not overcome at once, to teach us to be constant, for as much as God will certainly deliver his.
