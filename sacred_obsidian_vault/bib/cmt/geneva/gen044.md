 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#002">Genesis 44:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 44:2</a></font></span></p>And (a) put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) We may not use this example to justify any unlawful practices, seeing God has commanded us to walk in simplicity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#005">Genesis 44:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 44:5</a></font></span></p>[Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and (b) whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Because the people thought he could divine, he attributes to himself that knowledge: or else he pretends that he consults with soothsayers: which deceit is worthy to be reproved.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#013">Genesis 44:13</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) To show how greatly the thing displeased them and how sorry they were for it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 44:16</a></font></span></p>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? (d) God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) If we see no obvious cause for our affliction, let us look to the secret counsel of God, who punishes us justly for our sins.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018">Genesis 44:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">gen 44:18</a></font></span></p>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even (e) as Pharaoh. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Equal in authority or, next to the king.

 </p><p>(f) Rachel bore to Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) You will cause me to die for sorrow.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#034">Genesis 44:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">gen 44:34</a></font></span></p>For (h) how shall I go up to my father, and the lad [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning, he would rather remain as their prisoner, than to return and see his father in sorrow.
