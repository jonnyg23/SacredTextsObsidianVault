 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001">Exodus 32:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">exo 32:1</a></font></span></p>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto 
 <p>
 </p><p>Aaron, and said unto him, Up, (a) make us gods, which shall go before us; for [as for] this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) The root of Idolatry is when men think that God is not present, unless they see him physically.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002">Exodus 32:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">exo 32:2</a></font></span></p>And Aaron said unto them, (b) Break off the golden earrings, which [are] in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] unto me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Thinking that they would rather abandon idolatry, than give up their most precious jewels.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#003">Exodus 32:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">exo 32:3</a></font></span></p>And all the people brake off the (c) golden earrings which [were] in their ears, and brought [them] unto Aaron. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Such is the rage of idolaters, that they spare no cost to satisfy their wicked desires.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004">Exodus 32:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">exo 32:4</a></font></span></p>And he received [them] at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a (d) molten calf: and they said, These [be] thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) They remembered the sins of Egypt, where they saw calves, oxen and serpents worshipped.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008">Exodus 32:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">exo 32:8</a></font></span></p>They (e) have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These [be] thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By which we see the need we have to pray earnestly to God, to keep us in his true obedience, and to send us good guides.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010">Exodus 32:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">exo 32:10</a></font></span></p>Now (f) therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) God shows that the prayers of the godly hold back his punishment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013">Exodus 32:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">exo 32:13</a></font></span></p>Remember (g) Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit [it] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, your promise made to Abraham.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016">Exodus 32:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">exo 32:16</a></font></span></p>And the tables [were] the work of God, and (h) the writing [was] the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) All these repetitions show how excellent a thing they defrauded themselves of by their idolatry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020">Exodus 32:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">exo 32:20</a></font></span></p>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and strawed [it] upon the water, and made the children of Israel (i) drink [of it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Partly to despise them for their idolatry, and partly so they would have no opportunity to remember the calf later.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025">Exodus 32:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">exo 32:25</a></font></span></p>And when Moses saw that the people [were] (k) naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto [their] shame among their enemies:) 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Both destitute of God's favour, and an occasion for their enemies to speak evil of their God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027">Exodus 32:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">exo 32:27</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and (l) slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) This fact did so please God, that he turned the curse of Jacob against Levi to a blessing, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009">Deu 33:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#029">Exodus 32:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">exo 32:29</a></font></span></p>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his (m) son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) In revenging God's glory we must have no partiality to person, but lay aside all carnal affection.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Exodus 32:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">exo 32:32</a></font></span></p>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, (n) out of thy book which thou hast written. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) He esteemed the glory of God so much, that he preferred it even to his own salvation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033">Exodus 32:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">exo 32:33</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my (o) book. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) I will make it known that he was never predestined in my eternal counsel to life everlasting.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034">Exodus 32:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">exo 32:34</a></font></span></p>(p) Therefore now go, lead the people unto [the place] of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) This demonstrates how grievous a sin idolatry is, seeing that at Moses prayer God would not fully remit it.
