 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 10:1</a></font></span></p>My soul is (a) weary of my life; I will leave my (b) complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) I am more like a dead man, than to one that lives. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) I will make an ample declaration of my torments, accusing myself and not God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#002">Job 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 10:2</a></font></span></p>I will say unto God, Do not (c) condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He would not that God would proceed against him by his secret justice, but by the ordinary means that he punishes others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#003">Job 10:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 10:3</a></font></span></p>[Is it] (d) good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the (e) work of thine hands, and shine upon the (f) counsel of the wicked? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Is it agreeable to your justice to do me wrong? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Will you be without compassions? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Will you gratify the wicked and condemn me?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#004">Job 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 10:4</a></font></span></p>Hast thou eyes of (g) flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Do you do this of ignorance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#005">Job 10:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 10:5</a></font></span></p>[Are] thy days as the (h) days of man? [are] thy years as man's days, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Are you inconstant and changeable as the times, today a friend, tomorrow an enemy?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#007">Job 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 10:7</a></font></span></p>Thou knowest that I am not (i) wicked; and [there is] none that can deliver out of thine hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) By affliction you keep me as in a prison, and restrain me from doing evil, neither can any set me free.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008">Job 10:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 10:8</a></font></span></p>Thine (k) hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) In these eight verses following he describes the mercy of God, in the wonderful creation of man: and on it grounds that God should not show himself rigorous against him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#009">Job 10:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 10:9</a></font></span></p>Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as (l) the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) As brittle as a pot of clay.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#012">Job 10:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 10:12</a></font></span></p>Thou hast granted me life and (m) favour, and thy (n) visitation hath preserved my spirit. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, reason and understanding, and many other gifts, by which man excels all earthly creatures. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, the fatherly care and providence by which you preserved me, and without which I would perish immediately.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013">Job 10:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 10:13</a></font></span></p>And these [things] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know (o) that this [is] with thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Though I am not fully able to comprehend these things, yet I must confess that it is so.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015">Job 10:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 10:15</a></font></span></p>If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not (p) lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) I will always walk in fear and humility, knowing that no one is just before you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#016">Job 10:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 10:16</a></font></span></p>For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself (q) marvellous upon me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Job being sore assaulted in this battle between the flesh and the spirit, breaks out into these affections, wishing rather for short days than long pain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017">Job 10:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 10:17</a></font></span></p>Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; (r) changes and war [are] against me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) That is, diversity of diseases and in great abundance; showing that God has infinite means to punish man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020">Job 10:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 10:20</a></font></span></p>[Are] not my days few? (s) cease [then, and] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) He wishes that God would leave off his affliction, considering his great misery and the shortness of his life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021">Job 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 10:21</a></font></span></p>Before I go [whence] I shall not (t) return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) He speaks this in the person of a sinner, that is overcome with passions and with the feeling of God's judgments and therefore cannot apprehend in that state the mercies of God, and the comfort of the resurrection.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022">Job 10:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 10:22</a></font></span></p>A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of the shadow of death, without any (u) order, and [where] the light [is] as darkness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) No distinction between light and darkness but where there is very darkness itself.
