 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 57:1</a></font></span></p>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth [it] to heart: and merciful men [are] taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away (a) from the evil [to come]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) From the plague that is at hand, and also because God will punish the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002">Isaiah 57:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 57:2</a></font></span></p>(b) He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, [each one] walking [in] his uprightness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The soul of the righteous will be in joy, and their body will rest in the grave to the time of the resurrection, because they walked before the Lord.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He threatens the wicked hypocrites, who under the pretence of the name of God's people, derided God's word and his promises: boasting openly that they were the children of Abraham, but because they were not faithful and obedient as Abraham was, he calls them bastards and the children of sorcerers, who forsook God, and fled to wicked means for comfort.

 <p>
