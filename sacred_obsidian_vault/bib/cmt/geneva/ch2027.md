And the people did yet (b) corruptly. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, to offer incense against the word of God, which is spoken of in the commendation of Jotham.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was 60 cubits high and was for the height called Ophel: it was at the east gate and mention is made of it in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004">Ch2 3:4</a>).
