 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001">Zechariah 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 6:1</a></font></span></p>And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four (a) chariots out from between (b) two mountains; and the mountains [were] mountains of brass. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By chariots here, as by horses before, he means the swift messengers of God to execute and declare his will. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) By the mountains he means the external counsel and providence of God, by which he has from before all eternity declared what will come to pass, and that which neither Satan nor all the world can alter.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002">Zechariah 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">zac 6:2</a></font></span></p>In the first chariot [were] (c) red horses; and in the second chariot (d) black horses; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which signifies the great cruelty and persecution that the Church had endured under different enemies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Signifying that they had endured great afflictions under the Babylonians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003">Zechariah 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zac 6:3</a></font></span></p>And in the third chariot (e) white horses; and in the fourth chariot (f) spotted and bay horses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) These represented their state under the Persians, who restored them to their liberty. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Which signified that God would sometimes give his Church rest, and pour his plagues upon their enemies, as he did in destroying Nineveh and Babylon, and other of their enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005">Zechariah 6:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 6:5</a></font></span></p>And the angel answered and said to me, These [are] the four (g) spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Meaning, all the actions and motions of God's Spirit, whom according to his unchangeable counsel he causes to appear through all the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zechariah 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 6:6</a></font></span></p>The black horses which [are] in it go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth toward the (h) south country. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, towards Egypt, and other countries there about.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zechariah 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 6:7</a></font></span></p>And the (i) bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Go from here, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, those of different colours, which ask permission, to signify that Satan has no power to hurt or afflict, until God gives it to him; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012">Job 1:12</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008">Zechariah 6:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 6:8</a></font></span></p>Then he cried upon me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my (k) spirit in the north country. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) By punishing the Chaldeans my anger ceased, and you were delivered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010">Zechariah 6:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zac 6:10</a></font></span></p>Take of [them of] the captivity, [even] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, who are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of (l) Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) To receive from him and the other three, money to make the two crowns: who were men of great authority among the Jews, and doubted of the restitution of the kingdom, and of the priesthood, and hurt others by their example.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zechariah 6:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">zac 6:11</a></font></span></p>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set [them] upon the (m) head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Because this could not be attributed to any one according to the Law, therefore it follows that Joshua must represent the Messiah, who was both Priest and King.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zechariah 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">zac 6:12</a></font></span></p>And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name [is] The (n) BRANCH; and he shall grow (o) up out of his place, and he shall (p) build the temple of the LORD: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Meaning Christ, of whom Joshua was the figure: for in Greek they were both called Jesus. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, of himself without the help of man. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) Which declares that no one could build this temple of which Haggai speaks, but only Christ: and therefore it was spiritual, and not material; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Hag 2:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zechariah 6:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">zac 6:13</a></font></span></p>Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the (q) glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between (r) them both. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Of which Joshua had but a shadow. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(r) The two offices of the kingdom and priesthood, will be joined together in such a way, that they will no longer be separated.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zechariah 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">zac 6:14</a></font></span></p>And the crowns shall be to (s) Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to (t) Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a (u) memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Who was also called Heldai. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(t) He was also called Joshias. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(u) That they may acknowledge their infirmity, who thought that all things would be restored immediately: and of this their infidelity these two crowns will remain as tokens; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006">Act 1:6</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015">Zechariah 6:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">zac 6:15</a></font></span></p>And they [that are] (x) far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently (y) obey the voice of the LORD your God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) That is, the Gentiles by the preaching of the Gospel, will help toward the building of the spiritual temple. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(y) If you will believe and remain in the obedience of faith.
