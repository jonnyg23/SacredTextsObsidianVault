 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001">Amos 9:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">amo 9:1</a></font></span></p>I saw the Lord standing upon the (a) altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the (b) head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which was at Jerusalem: for he did not appear in the idolatrous places of Israel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Both the most important of them, and also the common people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003">Amos 9:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">amo 9:3</a></font></span></p>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the (c) serpent, and he shall bite them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He shows that God will declare himself as an enemy to them in all places, and that his elements and all his creatures will be enemies to destroy them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006">Amos 9:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">amo 9:6</a></font></span></p>[It is] he that buildeth his (d) stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD [is] his name. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He declares by the wonderful power of God, by the making of the heavens and the elements, that it is not possible for man to escape his judgments when he punishes.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007">Amos 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">amo 9:7</a></font></span></p>[Are] ye not as children of the Ethiopians (e) unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from (f) Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Am I more bound to you than to the Ethiopians, or other people? Yet I have bestowed upon you greater benefits. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004">Jer 47:4</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008">Amos 9:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">amo 9:8</a></font></span></p>Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD [are] upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly (g) destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though he destroys the rebellious multitude, yet he will always reserve the remnant of his Church to call upon his name.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009">Amos 9:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">amo 9:9</a></font></span></p>For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as [corn] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the (h) least grain fall upon the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning that none of his own would perish in his wrath.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011">Amos 9:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">amo 9:11</a></font></span></p>In that day will I raise up the (i) tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) I will send the promised Messiah, and restore by him the spiritual Israel; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016">Act 15:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012">Amos 9:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">amo 9:12</a></font></span></p>That they may possess the remnant of (k) Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Meaning, the very enemies (as were the Edomites) and others would be united with the Jews in one society and body, of which Christ would be the head.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013">Amos 9:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">amo 9:13</a></font></span></p>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall (l) overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall (m) drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Signifying, that there will be great abundance of all things, so that when one type of fruit is ripe, another would follow, and every one in order; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005">Lev 26:5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018">Joe 3:18</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014">Amos 9:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">amo 9:14</a></font></span></p>(n) And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) The accomplishment of this is under Christ, when they are planted in this Church, out of which they can never be pulled, after they have once been grafted into it.
