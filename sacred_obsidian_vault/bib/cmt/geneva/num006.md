 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">num 6:2</a></font></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate [themselves] to vow a vow of a (a) Nazarite, to separate [themselves] unto the LORD: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who separated themselves from the world, and dedicated themselves to God: a figure which was accomplished in Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#006">Numbers 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 6:6</a></font></span></p>All the days that he separateth [himself] unto the LORD he shall come at no (b) dead body. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As at burials, or mournings.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#007">Numbers 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 6:7</a></font></span></p>He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God [is] upon (c) his head. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) In that he allowed his hair to grow, he signified that he was consecrated to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#009">Numbers 6:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 6:9</a></font></span></p>And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the (d) head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Whose long hair is a sign that he is dedicated to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#011">Numbers 6:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">num 6:11</a></font></span></p>And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by (e) the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By being present where the deceased was.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#012">Numbers 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 6:12</a></font></span></p>And he shall (f) consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the (g) days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Beginning at the eighth day, when he is purified. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) So that he shall begin his vow anew.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#018">Numbers 6:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">num 6:18</a></font></span></p>And the Nazarite shall shave the head (h) of his separation [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and (i) put [it] in the fire which [is] under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) In token that his vow is ended. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) For the hair which was consecrated to the Lord, might not be cast into any profane place.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#021">Numbers 6:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">num 6:21</a></font></span></p>This [is] the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, [and of] his offering unto the LORD for his separation, (k) beside [that] that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) At the least he shall do this, if he is not able to offer more.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023">Numbers 6:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">num 6:23</a></font></span></p>Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall (l) bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, pray for them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#027">Numbers 6:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">num 6:27</a></font></span></p>And they shall put my (m) name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) They shall pray in my Name for them.
