 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001">Psalms 49:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 49:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." Hear (a) this, all [ye] people; give ear, all [ye] inhabitants of the world: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He will intreat how God governs the world by his providence which cannot be perceived by the judgment of the flesh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005">Psalms 49:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 49:5</a></font></span></p>Wherefore should I (b) fear in the days of evil, [when] the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Though wickedness reigns and enemies rage, seeing God will execute his judgments against the wicked at a suitable time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006">Psalms 49:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 49:6</a></font></span></p>They that trust in their (c) wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) To trust in riches is madness, seeing they can neither restore life, nor prolong it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008">Psalms 49:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 49:8</a></font></span></p>(For the redemption of their soul [is] (d) precious, (e) and it ceaseth for ever:) 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, so rare or not to be found, as prophecy was precious in the days of Eli, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001">Sa1 3:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning it is impossible to live for ever: also that life and death are only in God's hands.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010">Psalms 49:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 49:10</a></font></span></p>For he seeth [that] wise men (f) die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to (g) others. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) In that that death makes no difference between the persons. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, not to their children, but to strangers. Yet the wicked profit not by these examples, but still dream of immortality on earth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012">Psalms 49:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 49:12</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless man [being] in honour abideth not: he is like the (h) beasts [that] perish. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Concerning the death of the body.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013">Psalms 49:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 49:13</a></font></span></p>This their way [is] their folly: yet their posterity (i) approve their sayings. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) They speak and do the same thing that their fathers did.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014">Psalms 49:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 49:14</a></font></span></p>(k) Like sheep they are laid in the grave; (l) death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the (m) morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) As sheep are gathered into the fold, so shall they be brought to the grave. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) Because they have no part of life everlasting. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Christ's coming is as the morning, when the elect will reign with Christ their head over the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018">Psalms 49:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 49:18</a></font></span></p>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and (n) [men] will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) The flatterers praise them who live in delight and pleasures.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019">Psalms 49:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 49:19</a></font></span></p>(o) He shall go to the generation of his fathers; (p) they shall never see light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) And not pass the term appointed for life. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) Both they and their fathers will live here but a while and at length die forever.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020">Psalms 49:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">psa 49:20</a></font></span></p>Man [that is] in honour, and (q) understandeth not, is like the beasts [that] perish. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) He condemns man's ingratitude, who having received excellent gifts from God, abuses them like a beast to his own condemnation.
