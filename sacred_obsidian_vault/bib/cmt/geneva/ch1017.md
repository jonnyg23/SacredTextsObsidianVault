 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch1 17:3</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass the same (d) night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, in a tent which moved to and fro. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#006">1 Chronicles 17:6</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Of a shepherd of sheep I made you a shepherd of men: so that you did not come to this dignity through your own merits, but by my pure grace.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Make them sure that they will not move. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#010">1 Chronicles 17:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch1 17:10</a></font></span></p>And since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will (i) build thee an house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Will give you great posterity.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ch1 17:13</a></font></span></p>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took [it] from [him] that was before (l) thee:

 <p>
 </p><p>(o) You have promised a kingdom that will continue to me and my posterity and that Christ will proceed from me.
