 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The siege had continued from the time of Nadab Jeroboam's son.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg1 16:21</a></font></span></p>Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: (i) half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 
 <p>
