 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This city Beeroth was in the tribe of Benjamin, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025">Jos 18:25</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) They disguised themselves as merchants, who came to buy wheat. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) There is nothing so vile and dangerous, which the wicked will not undertake in hope of money and favour.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) In that neither the example of him that slew Saul, nor duty to their master, nor the innocency of the person, nor reverence for the place, nor time moved them, they deserved most grievous punishment.
