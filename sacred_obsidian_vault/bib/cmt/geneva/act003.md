 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001">Acts 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">act 3:1</a></font></span></p>Now (1) Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Christ, in healing a man that was born lame and well known to all men, both in a famous place and at a popular time, by the hands of his apostles partly strengthens and encourages those who believed, and partly also calls others to believe.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005">Acts 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 3:5</a></font></span></p>And he (a) gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Both with heart and eyes.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011">Acts 3:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">act 3:11</a></font></span></p>And as the lame man which was healed (b) held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Either because he loved them who had healed him, or because he feared that if he let them go out of his sight that he would become lame again.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012">Acts 3:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">act 3:12</a></font></span></p>(2) And when Peter saw [it], he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Miracles are appointed to convince the unbelievers, and therefore they wickedly abuse the miracles who, standing amazed, either at the miracles themselves or at the instruments and means which is pleases God to use, take an occasion to establish idolatry and superstition by that which God has provided for the knowledge of his true worship, that is, Christianity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015">Acts 3:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">act 3:15</a></font></span></p>And killed the Prince (c) of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Who has life in himself, and gives life to others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016">Acts 3:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">act 3:16</a></font></span></p>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: (d) yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Because he believed on him who was raised from the dead, whose name he heard about from us.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017">Acts 3:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">act 3:17</a></font></span></p>(3) And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did [it], as [did] also your rulers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) It is best of all to receive Christ as soon as he is offered to us: but those who have neglected so great a benefit through man's weakness, yet have repentance as a means. As for the shame of the cross, we have to set against that the decree and purpose of God for Christ, foretold by the Prophets, how that first of all he would be crucified here upon the earth, and then he would appear from heaven the judge and restorer of all things, that all believers might be saved, and all unbelievers utterly perish.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018">Acts 3:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 3:18</a></font></span></p>But those things, which God before had shewed (e) by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Though there were many Prophets, yet he speaks only of one mouth, to show us the consent and agreement of the Prophets.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021">Acts 3:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">act 3:21</a></font></span></p>(f) Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Or, be taken up into heaven.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022">Acts 3:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">act 3:22</a></font></span></p>For Moses truly said unto the fathers, (g) A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This promise referred to an excellent and singular Prophet.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024">Acts 3:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">act 3:24</a></font></span></p>Yea, and all the prophets (h) from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) At which time the kingdom of Israel was established.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025">Acts 3:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">act 3:25</a></font></span></p>(4) Ye are the (i) children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The Jews that believed are the first begotten in the kingdom of God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) For whom the Prophets were especially appointed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026">Acts 3:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">act 3:26</a></font></span></p>Unto you first God, having (k) raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Given to the world, or raised from the dead, and advanced to his kingdom.
