 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa2 9:1</a></font></span></p>And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for (a) Jonathan's sake? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because of my oath and promise made to Jonathan, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#015">Sa1 20:15</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa2 9:3</a></font></span></p>And the king said, [Is] there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the (b) kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, [which is] lame on [his] feet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Such mercy as shall be acceptable to God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#005">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa2 9:5</a></font></span></p>Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of (c) Ammiel, from Lodebar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Who was also called Eliam the father of Bathsheba, David's wife. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa2 9:8</a></font></span></p>And he bowed himself, and said, What [is] thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such (d) a dead dog as I [am]? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Meaning, a despised person. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#010">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 9:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">sa2 9:10</a></font></span></p>Thou therefore, and (e) thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in [the fruits], that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Be ye provident overseers and governors of his lands, that they may be profitable.

(f) As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That Mephibosheth may have all things at commandment, as becomes a king's son.
