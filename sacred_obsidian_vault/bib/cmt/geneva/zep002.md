 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001">Zephaniah 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zep 2:1</a></font></span></p>Gather (a) yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He exhorts them to repentance, and wills them to descend into themselves and gather themselves, lest they be scattered like chaff.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003">Zephaniah 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zep 2:3</a></font></span></p>Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which (b) have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, who have lived uprightly and godly according as he prescribes by his word.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004">Zephaniah 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">zep 2:4</a></font></span></p>For (c) Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He comforts the faithful in that God would change his punishments from them to the Philistines their enemies, and other nations.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005">Zephaniah 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zep 2:5</a></font></span></p>Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea (d) coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, Galilee: by these nations he means the people that dwelt near to the Jews, and instead of friendship were their enemies: therefore he calls them Canaanites, whom the Lord appointed to be slain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007">Zephaniah 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zep 2:7</a></font></span></p>And the coast shall be for the (e) remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows why God would destroy their enemies, because their country would be a resting place for his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008">Zephaniah 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zep 2:8</a></font></span></p>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and (f) magnified [themselves] against their border. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) These nations presumed to take from the Jews that country which the Lord had given them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011">Zephaniah 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">zep 2:11</a></font></span></p>The LORD [will be] terrible unto them: (g) for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and [men] shall worship him, every one from his place, [even] all the isles of the heathen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) When he will deliver his people and destroy their enemies and idols, his glory will shine throughout all the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014">Zephaniah 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">zep 2:14</a></font></span></p>And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the (h) cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation [shall be] in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011">Isa 34:11</a>)  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015">Zephaniah 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">zep 2:15</a></font></span></p>This [is] the (i) rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I [am], and [there is] none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning, Nineveh, which rejoicing so much of her strength and prosperity, should be thus made waste, and God's people delivered.
