 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001">Judges 21:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jdg 21:1</a></font></span></p>Now the men of Israel had (a) sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This was a rash oath, and not from judgment: for they later broke it, showing secretly the means to marry certain of their daughters.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#004">Judges 21:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jdg 21:4</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an (b) altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) According to their custom, when they would consult the Lord.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#006">Judges 21:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jdg 21:6</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel (c) repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Or, were sorry that they had destroyed their brethren, as it appears in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015">Jdg 21:15</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008">Judges 21:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jdg 21:8</a></font></span></p>And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Israel that (d) came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Condemning them as lovers of evil, who would not punish it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#013">Judges 21:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jdg 21:13</a></font></span></p>And the whole congregation (e) sent [some] to speak to the children of Benjamin that [were] in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, about four months after the punishment, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#047">Jdg 20:47</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#014">Judges 21:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jdg 21:14</a></font></span></p>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet (f) so they sufficed them not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For they were short two hundred.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#017">Judges 21:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jdg 21:17</a></font></span></p>And they said, [There must be] (g) an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Benjamin must be preserved to have the twelfth portion in the inheritance of Jacob.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019">Judges 21:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jdg 21:19</a></font></span></p>Then they said, Behold, [there is] a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly [in a place] which [is] on the (h) north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He describes the place where the maids used to dance yearly, and sing psalms and songs of God's works among them, as the custom was then.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#022">Judges 21:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">jdg 21:22</a></font></span></p>And it shall be, (i) when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, [that] ye should be guilty. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Though they attempted to convince man that they had kept their oath, before God it was broken.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#023">Judges 21:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">jdg 21:23</a></font></span></p>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took [them] wives, according to their (k) number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Meaning, two hundred.
