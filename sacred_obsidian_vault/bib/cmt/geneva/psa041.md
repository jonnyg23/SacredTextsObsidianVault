 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001">Psalms 41:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 41:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Blessed [is] he that (a) considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Not condemning him as accused whom God visits, knowing that there are various reasons why God lays his hand on us, yea and afterwards he restores us.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003">Psalms 41:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 41:3</a></font></span></p>The LORD will strengthen him upon the (b) bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his (c) bed in his sickness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When for sorrow and grief of mind he calls himself on his bed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) You have restored him in his sick bed and sent him comfort.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005">Psalms 41:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 41:5</a></font></span></p>Mine enemies (d) speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, curse me and cannot have their cruel hate quenched but with my shameful death.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006">Psalms 41:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 41:6</a></font></span></p>And if he come to see [me], he speaketh (e) vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; [when] he goeth abroad, he telleth [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For pretending to comfort me, he conspires my death in his heart, and brags of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008">Psalms 41:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 41:8</a></font></span></p>(f) An evil disease, [say they], cleaveth fast unto him: and [now] that he lieth he shall rise up no more. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The enemies thought by his sharp punishments that God had become his mortal enemy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009">Psalms 41:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 41:9</a></font></span></p>Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, (g) hath lifted up [his] heel against me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As David felt this falsehood, and as it was chiefly accomplished in Christ, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018">Joh 13:18</a>) so shall his members continually prove the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012">Psalms 41:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 41:12</a></font></span></p>And as for me, thou upholdest me (h) in mine integrity, and settest me before thy (i) face for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning, either in prosperity of life or in the true fear of God against all temptation. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Showing me evident signs of your fatherly providence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013">Psalms 41:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 41:13</a></font></span></p>Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. (k) Amen, and Amen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) By this repetition he stirs up the faithful to praise God.
