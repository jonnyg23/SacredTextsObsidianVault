 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 39:2</a></font></span></p>[And] in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth [day] of the month, the city was broken (a) up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The gates and walls were broken down.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004">Jeremiah 39:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jer 39:4</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the (b) gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Which was a postern door, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004">Kg2 25:4</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005">Jeremiah 39:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 39:5</a></font></span></p>But the Chaldeans' army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to (c) Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which is called Antioch in Syria.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010">Jeremiah 39:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 39:10</a></font></span></p>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the (d) poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For the rich and the mighty who put their trust in their shifts and means, were by God's just judgments most rigorously handled.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012">Jeremiah 39:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 39:12</a></font></span></p>Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him (e) even as he shall say to thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Thus God preserved his prophet by his means, whom he made the scourge to punish the king, and them that were his enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014">Jeremiah 39:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 39:14</a></font></span></p>Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to (f) Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Whom the king of Babel had now appointed governor over the rest of the Jews that he left behind.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018">Jeremiah 39:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jer 39:18</a></font></span></p>For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prize to thee: because thou (g) hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Thus God recompensed his zeal and favour which he showed to his prophet in his troubles.
