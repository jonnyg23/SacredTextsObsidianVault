 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Is this the way for a man that will learn, to strive with God? which he reproves in Job.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004">Job 40:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 40:4</a></font></span></p>Behold, I am (r) vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008">Job 40:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 40:8</a></font></span></p>Wilt thou also disannul (a) my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Signifying that they who justify themselves condemn God as unjust.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010">Job 40:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 40:10</a></font></span></p>Deck thyself now [with] (b) majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.

 </p><p>(b) Meaning, that these were proper to God, and belonged to no man.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#013">Job 40:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 40:13</a></font></span></p>Hide them in the dust together; [and] bind (c) their faces in secret.

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) This beast is thought to be the elephant, or some other, which is unknown. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Whom I made as well as you. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) This commends the providence of God toward man: for if he were given to devour as a lion, nothing would be able to resist him, or content him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019">Job 40:19</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He is one of the chief works of God among the beasts. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Though man dare not come near him, yet God can kill him.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 40:23</a></font></span></p>Behold, he drinketh up a river, (k) [and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He drinks at leisure, and fears nobody.
