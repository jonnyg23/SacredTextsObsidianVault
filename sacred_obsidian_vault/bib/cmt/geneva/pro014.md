 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#001">Proverbs 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 14:1</a></font></span></p>Every wise woman (a) buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, takes pains to profit her family, and to do that which concerns her duty in her house.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#002">Proverbs 14:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 14:2</a></font></span></p>He that walketh in his (b) uprightness feareth the LORD: but [he that is] perverse in his ways despiseth him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, in uprightness of heart, and without hypocrisy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003">Proverbs 14:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pro 14:3</a></font></span></p>In the mouth of the foolish [is] a (c) rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) His proud tongue will cause him to be punished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004">Proverbs 14:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">pro 14:4</a></font></span></p>Where no (d) oxen [are], the crib [is] clean: but much increase [is] by the strength of the ox. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By the ox is meant labour, and by the crib the barn, meaning, without labour there is no profit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#005">Proverbs 14:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">pro 14:5</a></font></span></p>A faithful witness will not lie: but (e) a false witness will utter lies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For the maintenance of his own ambition, and not for God's glory, as Simon Magus.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#009">Proverbs 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">pro 14:9</a></font></span></p>Fools make a mock at (f) sin: but among the righteous [there is] favour. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Does not know the grievousness of it, nor God's judgments against the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#010">Proverbs 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 14:10</a></font></span></p>The heart knoweth its own (g) bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As a man's conscience is witness to his own grief, so another cannot feel the joy and comfort which a man feels in himself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013">Proverbs 14:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 14:13</a></font></span></p>Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; (h) and the end of that mirth [is] heaviness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He shows the allurement to sin, that it seems sweet, but the end of it is destruction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#014">Proverbs 14:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">pro 14:14</a></font></span></p>The backslider in heart (i) shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man [shall be satisfied] from himself. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He who forsakes God will be punished, and made weary of his sins, in which he delighted.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#019">Proverbs 14:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">pro 14:19</a></font></span></p>The evil bow before the good; and the wicked (k) at the gates of the righteous. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) If this come not daily to pass, we must consider that it is because of our sins, which hinder God's workings.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#028">Proverbs 14:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">pro 14:28</a></font></span></p>In the multitude of (l) people [is] the king's honour: but in the lack of people [is] the destruction of the prince. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, the strength of a king stands in many people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#033">Proverbs 14:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">pro 14:33</a></font></span></p>Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but [that which is] (m) in the midst of fools is made known. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Forasmuch as they are convicted by it, and silenced.
