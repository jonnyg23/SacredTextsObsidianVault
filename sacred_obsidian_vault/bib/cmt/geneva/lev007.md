 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">lev 7:1</a></font></span></p>Likewise this [is] the law of the (a) trespass offering: it [is] most holy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which is for the smaller sins, and such as are committed by ignorance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002">Leviticus 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lev 7:2</a></font></span></p>In the place (b) where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) At the court gate.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#003">Leviticus 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lev 7:3</a></font></span></p>And (c) he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) the high priest.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007">Leviticus 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">lev 7:7</a></font></span></p>As the sin offering [is], so [is] the trespass offering: [there is] one (d) law for them: the priest that maketh atonement (e) therewith shall have [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The same ceremonies, even though this word trespass signifies less then sin. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning, the rest which is left and not burnt.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010">Leviticus 7:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">lev 7:10</a></font></span></p>And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and (f) dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one [as much] as another. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Because it had no oil or liquor.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012">Leviticus 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">lev 7:12</a></font></span></p>If he offer it for a (g) thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Peace offerings contain a confession and thanksgiving for a benefit received, and also a vow, and free offering to receive a benefit.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">lev 7:16</a></font></span></p>But if the sacrifice of his offering [be] a (h) vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) If he makes a vow to offer: or else the flesh of the peace offerings must be eaten the same day.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018">Leviticus 7:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">lev 7:18</a></font></span></p>And if [any] of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall (i) bear his iniquity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) The sin for which he offered shall remain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019">Leviticus 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">lev 7:19</a></font></span></p>And the flesh that toucheth any unclean (k) [thing] shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and (l) as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) After it is sacrificed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) Of the peace offering that is clean.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">lev 7:30</a></font></span></p>His own (m) hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) And should not send it by another.

 <p>
 </p><p>(n) that is, his privilege, reward and portion.
