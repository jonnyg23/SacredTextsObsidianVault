 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001">Deuteronomy 33:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">deu 33:1</a></font></span></p>And this [is] the (a) blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This blessing contains not only a simple prayer, but an assurance of the effect of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002">Deuteronomy 33:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">deu 33:2</a></font></span></p>And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten (b) thousands of saints: from his right hand [went] a fiery law for them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, infinite angels.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003">Deuteronomy 33:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">deu 33:3</a></font></span></p>Yea, he loved the people; (c) all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at (d) thy feet; [every one] shall receive of thy words. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Hebrew, his saints, that is, the children of Israel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) As thy disciples.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#004">Deuteronomy 33:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">deu 33:4</a></font></span></p>Moses commanded us a law, [even] the (e) inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) To us and our successors.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006">Deuteronomy 33:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 33:6</a></font></span></p>Let (f) Reuben live, and not die; and let [not] his men be few. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Reuben will be one of the tribes of God's people, though for his sin his honour is diminished, and his family but small.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007">Deuteronomy 33:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">deu 33:7</a></font></span></p>And this [is the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be (g) sufficient for him; and be thou an help [to him] from his enemies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Signifying, that he would barely obtain Jacob's promise, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008">Gen 49:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009">Deuteronomy 33:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 33:9</a></font></span></p>Who said unto his father and to his mother, (h) I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He preferred God's glory to all natural affection, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030">Exo 28:30</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011">Deuteronomy 33:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">deu 33:11</a></font></span></p>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite (i) through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He declares that the ministers of God have many enemies, and therefore need to be prayed for.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012">Deuteronomy 33:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">deu 33:12</a></font></span></p>[And] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall (k) dwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Because the temple would be built in Zion, which was in the tribe of Benjamin, he shows that God would dwell with him there.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016">Deuteronomy 33:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">deu 33:16</a></font></span></p>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt in the (l) bush: let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which was God appearing to Moses, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002">Exo 3:2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018">Deuteronomy 33:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">deu 33:18</a></font></span></p>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy (m) going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) In thy prosperous voyages on the sea, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013">Gen 49:13</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019">Deuteronomy 33:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">deu 33:19</a></font></span></p>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for (n) they shall suck [of] the abundance of the seas, and [of] treasures hid in the sand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) The tribe of Zebulun.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021">Deuteronomy 33:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">deu 33:21</a></font></span></p>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, [in] a portion of the (o) lawgiver, [was he] seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) So the portion of the Gadites, and others on this side of the Jordan was God's, though it was not so known.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023">Deuteronomy 33:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">deu 33:23</a></font></span></p>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou (p) the west and the south. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Meaning, near the sea.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025">Deuteronomy 33:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">deu 33:25</a></font></span></p>Thy shoes [shall be] (q) iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) You will be strong or, your country full of metal. It seems that Simeon is left out, because he was under Judah, and his portion of his inheritance, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009">Jos 19:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028">Deuteronomy 33:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">deu 33:28</a></font></span></p>Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: (r) the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Who was plentiful in issue as a fountain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029">Deuteronomy 33:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">deu 33:29</a></font></span></p>Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency! and (s) thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Your enemies for fear shall lie and pretend to be in subjection.
