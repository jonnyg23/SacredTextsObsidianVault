 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 3:1</a></font></span></p>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD (a) before Eli. And the word of the LORD was (b) precious in those days; [there was] no open vision. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The Chaldee text reads "while Eli lived". 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Because there were very few prophets to declare it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 3:2</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laid down in his (c) place, and his eyes began to wax dim, [that] he could not see; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) In the court next to the tabernacle. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa1 3:3</a></font></span></p>And ere the (d) lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was], and Samuel was laid down [to sleep]; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, the lamps which burnt in the night. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 3:4</a></font></span></p>That the LORD (e) called Samuel: and he answered, Here [am] I. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Josephus writes that Samuel was 12 years old when the Lord appeared to him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#007">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sa1 3:7</a></font></span></p>Now Samuel did not yet know (f) the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) By vision. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 3:8</a></font></span></p>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli (g) perceived that the LORD had called the child. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Such was the corruption of those times that the chief priest had become dull and negligent to understand the Lord's appearing. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 3:11</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall (h) tingle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) God declares that sudden fear will come on men when they hear that the ark is taken, and see Eli's house destroyed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa1 3:14</a></font></span></p>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for (i) ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning that his posterity would never enjoy the chief priests office. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sa1 3:17</a></font></span></p>And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God (k) do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) God punish you after this and that sort, unless you tell me the truth, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#017">Rut 1:17</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">sa1 3:19</a></font></span></p>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words (l) fall to the ground. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The Lord accomplished whatever he had said.
