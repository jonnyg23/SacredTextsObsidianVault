 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001">Matthew 11:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mat 11:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of (a) commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in (b) their cities. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Christ shows by his works that he is the promised Messiah. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) Of instructing them with precepts. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) The disciples' cities, that is to say, in Galilee, where many of them were born; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007">Act 2:7</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007">Matthew 11:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mat 11:7</a></font></span></p>(2) And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The similarity and the difference between the ministry of the prophets, the preaching of John, and the full light, of the gospel, which Christ has brought.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011">Matthew 11:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mat 11:11</a></font></span></p>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the (c) kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) In the new state of the Church where the true glory of God shines: the people are not compared together, but the types of doctrines, the preaching of John with the law and the prophets: and again, the most clear preaching of the gospel is compared with John's.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013">Matthew 11:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mat 11:13</a></font></span></p>For all the prophets and the law (d) prophesied until John. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) They prophesied of things to come, which are now present, and clearly and plainly seen.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016">Matthew 11:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">mat 11:16</a></font></span></p>(3) But whereunto shall I liken this generation? (e) It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) There are none who are more stout and stubborn enemies of the gospel, than they to whom it ought to be most acceptable. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) He blames the perverseness of this age, by a proverb, in that they could be moved neither with rough nor gentle dealing.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019">Matthew 11:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mat 11:19</a></font></span></p>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. (4) But (f) wisdom is justified of her children. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) That which the many refuse, the elect and chosen embrace. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Wise men acknowledge the wisdom of the gospel when they receive it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020">Matthew 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mat 11:20</a></font></span></p>(5) Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The proud reject the gospel offered to them (to their great hurt and pain) which leads to the salvation of the simple.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025">Matthew 11:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mat 11:25</a></font></span></p>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast (g) revealed them unto babes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Through the ministry of Christ, who alone shows the truth of all things pertaining to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026">Matthew 11:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">mat 11:26</a></font></span></p>(h) Even so, Father: for so it seemed (i) good in thy sight. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) This word shows that he contents himself in his Father's council. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) God's will is the only rule of righteousness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027">Matthew 11:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">mat 11:27</a></font></span></p>(6) All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) There is no true knowledge of God, nor quietness of mind, but only in Christ alone.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030">Matthew 11:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">mat 11:30</a></font></span></p>For my yoke [is] (k) easy, and my burden is light. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) May easily be carried. For his commandments are not grievous, for all who are born of God overcome the world; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">Jo1 5:4</a>).
