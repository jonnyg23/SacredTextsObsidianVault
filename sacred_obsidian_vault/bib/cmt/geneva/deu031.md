 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, I will take my favour from them; as turning his face toward us shows his favour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019">Deuteronomy 31:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">deu 31:19</a></font></span></p>Now therefore write ye this (i) song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) For this is the nature of flesh, no longer to obey God, than it is under the rod.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">deu 31:21</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall (l) testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That these evils are come upon them, because they have forsaken me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026">Deuteronomy 31:26</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(o) By idolatry, and worshipping images, which are the work of your hands.
