 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">deu 2:1</a></font></span></p>Then (a) we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir (b) many days. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) They obeyed, after God had chastised them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Eight and thirty years, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014">Deu 2:14</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004">Deuteronomy 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">deu 2:4</a></font></span></p>And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the (c) coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This was the second time, before they had caused the Israelites to return, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021">Num 20:21</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007">Deuteronomy 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">deu 2:7</a></font></span></p>For the LORD thy God hath (d) blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) And given you means, with which you may make recompence: also God will direct you by his providence, as he has done.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009">Deuteronomy 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 2:9</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children (e) of Lot [for] a possession. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which were the Moabites and Ammonites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010">Deuteronomy 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 2:10</a></font></span></p>The (f) Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">deu 2:14</a></font></span></p>And the (g) space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He shows by this, that as God is true in his promise, so his threatenings are not in vain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015">Deuteronomy 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">deu 2:15</a></font></span></p>For indeed the (h) hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) His plague and punishment to destroy all that were twenty years old and above.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020">Deuteronomy 2:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">deu 2:20</a></font></span></p>(That also was accounted a land (i) of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Who called themselves Rephaims: that is, preservers, or physicians to heal and reform vices: but were indeed Zamzummims, that is, wicked and abominable.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">deu 2:24</a></font></span></p>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the (k) Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) According to his promise made to Abraham, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016">Gen 15:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025">Deuteronomy 2:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">deu 2:25</a></font></span></p>This day will I (l) begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) This declares that the hearts of men are in God's hands either to be made faint, or bold.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029">Deuteronomy 2:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">deu 2:29</a></font></span></p>(As the (m) children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Because neither intreaty nor examples or others could move him, he could not complain of his just destruction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030">Deuteronomy 2:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">deu 2:30</a></font></span></p>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God (n) hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) God in his election and reprobation not only appoints the ends, but the means tending to the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034">Deuteronomy 2:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">deu 2:34</a></font></span></p>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the (o) women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) God had cursed Canaan, and therefore he did not want any of the wicked race to be preserved.
