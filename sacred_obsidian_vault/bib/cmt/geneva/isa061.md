 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isaiah 61:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 61:1</a></font></span></p>The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] (a) upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the (b) brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the (c) captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Thus belongs to all the prophets and ministers of God, but chiefly to Christ, of whose abundant graces everyone receives according as it pleases him to distribute. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) To them that are lively touched with the feeling of their sins. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Who are in the bondage of sin.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002">Isaiah 61:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 61:2</a></font></span></p>To proclaim the (d) acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of (e) vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The time when it pleased God to show his good favour to man, which Paul calls the fulness of time, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Gal 4:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) For when God delivers his Church, he punishes his enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003">Isaiah 61:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 61:3</a></font></span></p>To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for (f) ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called (g) trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which was the sign of mourning. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) Trees that bring forth good fruits, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008">Mat 3:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004">Isaiah 61:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 61:4</a></font></span></p>And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many (h) generations. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, for a long time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005">Isaiah 61:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 61:5</a></font></span></p>And foreigners shall (i) stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien [shall be] your plowmen and your vinedressers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) They will be ready to serve you in all your needs.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006">Isaiah 61:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 61:6</a></font></span></p>But ye shall be named the (k) Priests of the LORD: [men] shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the (l) riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) This is accomplished in the time of Christ, by whom all the faithful are made priests and kings, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010">Rev 5:10</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011">Isa 60:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016">Isa 60:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007">Isaiah 61:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 61:7</a></font></span></p>For your shame [ye shall have] (m) double; and [for] confusion (n) they shall rejoice in (o) their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the (p) double: everlasting joy shall be to them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Abundant recompence as this word is used, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002">Isa 40:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, the Jews. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, of the Gentiles. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(p) While the Gentiles had dominion over the Jews in times past, now they will have double authority over them and possess twice as much.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008">Isaiah 61:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 61:8</a></font></span></p>For I the LORD love judgment, I hate (q) robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) I will not receive their offerings who are extortioners, deceivers, hypocrites or that deprive me of my glory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009">Isaiah 61:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 61:9</a></font></span></p>And (r) their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they [are] the seed [which] the LORD hath blessed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) That is, of the Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010">Isaiah 61:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 61:10</a></font></span></p>(s) I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh [himself] with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth [herself] with her jewels. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) He shows what will be the affection, when they feel their deliverance.
