 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002">Job 17:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 17:2</a></font></span></p>[Are there] not (a) mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in (b) their provocation? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Instead of comfort, being now at death's door, he had but them that mocked at him, and discouraged him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003">Job 17:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 17:3</a></font></span></p>(c) Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who [is] he [that] (d) will strike hands with me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He reasons with God as a man beside himself, so that his cause might be brought to light. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) And answers for you?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004">Job 17:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 17:4</a></font></span></p>For thou hast hid their heart from (e) understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That these my afflictions are your just judgments, though man does not know the reason.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#005">Job 17:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 17:5</a></font></span></p>(f) He that speaketh flattery to [his] friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He who flatters a man, and only judges him happy in his prosperity, will not himself only but in his posterity be punished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006">Job 17:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 17:6</a></font></span></p>He hath made me also a (g) byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God has made all the world speak of me, because of my afflictions.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008">Job 17:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 17:8</a></font></span></p>Upright [men] shall be astonied at (i) this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, when they see the godly punished: but in the end they will come to understanding and know what will be the reward of the hypocrite.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009">Job 17:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 17:9</a></font></span></p>The righteous also shall hold on his (k) way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, will not be discouraged, considering that the godly are punished as well as the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010">Job 17:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 17:10</a></font></span></p>But as for (l) you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find [one] wise [man] among you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Job speaks to the three who came to comfort him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#012">Job 17:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 17:12</a></font></span></p>They change the (m) night into day: the light [is] short because of darkness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, have brought me sorrow instead of comfort.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013">Job 17:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 17:13</a></font></span></p>If I wait, (n) the grave [is] mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Though I should hope to come from adversity to prosperity, as your discourse pretends.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014">Job 17:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 17:14</a></font></span></p>I have said to corruption, Thou [art] my (o) father: to the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) I have no more hope in father, mother, sister, or any worldly thing: for the dust and worms will be to me instead of them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016">Job 17:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 17:16</a></font></span></p>(p) They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when [our] rest together [is] in the dust. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) All worldly hope and prosperity fail which you say, are only signs of God's favour but seeing that these things perish, I set my hope in God and in the life everlasting.
