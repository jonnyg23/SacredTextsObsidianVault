 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001">Mark 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mar 7:1</a></font></span></p>Then (1) came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) None resist the wisdom of God more than they that should be wisest, and they resist because of their zeal for their own traditions: for men please themselves in superstition more than in any other thing, that is to say, in a worship of God fondly devised by themselves.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002">Mark 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mar 7:2</a></font></span></p>And when they saw some of his disciples (a) eat bread with (b) defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Literally, "eat bread": an idiom which the Hebrews use, understanding bread to represent every type of food. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) For the Pharisees would not eat their food with unwashed hands, because they thought that their hands were defiled with the common handling of things; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011">Mat 15:11-12</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003">Mark 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mar 7:3</a></font></span></p>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, (c) holding the tradition of the elders. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Observing diligently.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004">Mark 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mar 7:4</a></font></span></p>And [when they come] from the (d) market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and (e) pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is to say, after coming from civil and worldly affairs they do not eat unless they first wash themselves. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) By these words are understood all types of vessels which we use daily.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005">Mark 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mar 7:5</a></font></span></p>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why (f) walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Why live they not? This is a Hebrew idiom: for among them the "way" is taken for "lifestyle".  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#006">Mark 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mar 7:6</a></font></span></p>(2) He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Hypocrisy is always joined with superstition.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#007">Mark 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mar 7:7</a></font></span></p>(3) Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The more earnest the superstitious are, the more mad they are in promising themselves God's favour because of their deeds.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008">Mark 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mar 7:8</a></font></span></p>(4) For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The deeds of superstitious men not only do not fulfil the law of God (as they blasphemously persuaded themselves) but these deeds utterly take away God's law.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#009">Mark 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mar 7:9</a></font></span></p>(5) And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) True religion, which is completely contrary to superstition, consists in spiritual worship: and all enemies of true religion, although they seem to have taken deep root, will be plucked up.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#010">Mark 7:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mar 7:10</a></font></span></p>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him (g) die the death: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Without hope of pardon, he will be put to death.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019">Mark 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mar 7:19</a></font></span></p>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, (h) purging all meats? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) For that which goes into the draught purges all meats.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022">Mark 7:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mar 7:22</a></font></span></p>Thefts, (i) covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an (k) evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) All types of craftiness by which men profit themselves at other men's losses. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) Corrupted malice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024">Mark 7:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mar 7:24</a></font></span></p>(6) And from thence he arose, and went into the (l) borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) That which the proud reject when it is offered to them, that same thing the modest and humble sinners as it were voraciously consume. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) Into the uttermost coasts of Palestine, which were next to Tyre and Sidon.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026">Mark 7:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">mar 7:26</a></font></span></p>The woman was a (m) Greek, a (n) Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) By nationality, profane. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) A neighbour of or near to Damascus.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#027">Mark 7:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">mar 7:27</a></font></span></p>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the (o) dogs. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) "Dog" here signifies a little dog, and he uses this term that he may seem to speak more reproachfully.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#028">Mark 7:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">mar 7:28</a></font></span></p>And she answered and said unto him, (p) Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) As if she said, "It is as thou sayest Lord, for it is enough for the dogs if they can but gather up the crumbs that are under the table; therefore I crave the crumbs and not the children's bread."  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031">Mark 7:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">mar 7:31</a></font></span></p>(7) And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of (q) Decapolis. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) As the Father created us to this life in the beginning in his only son, so does he also in him alone renew us into everlasting life. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(q) It was a little country, and it was so called because it consisted of ten cities under the jurisdiction of four surrounding governments; Pliny, book 3, chap. 8.
