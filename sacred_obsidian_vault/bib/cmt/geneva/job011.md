 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#002">Job 11:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 11:2</a></font></span></p>Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man (a) full of talk be justified? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Should he persuade by his great talk that he is just?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#004">Job 11:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 11:4</a></font></span></p>For thou hast said, (b) My doctrine [is] pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He charges Job with this, that he should say, that the thing which he spoke was true, and that he was without sin in the sight of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#006">Job 11:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 11:6</a></font></span></p>And that he would shew thee the (c) secrets of wisdom, that [they are] double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee [less] than thine iniquity [deserveth]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which is not to stand in justifying of yourself: he signifies that man will never be overcome while he reasons with another, and therefore God must break off the controversy, and stop man's mouth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008">Job 11:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 11:8</a></font></span></p>[It is] as high as heaven; what canst thou do? (d) deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, this perfection of God, and if man is not able to comprehend the height of the heavens, the depth of the earth, the breadth of the sea, which are but creatures, how can he attain to the perfection of the creator.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#010">Job 11:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 11:10</a></font></span></p>If he cut off, and (e) shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) If God should turn the state of things and establish a new order in nature, who could control him?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#012">Job 11:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 11:12</a></font></span></p>For vain man would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild (f) ass's colt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, without understanding, so that whatever gifts he has afterward come from God, and not from nature.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#013">Job 11:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 11:13</a></font></span></p>If thou (g) prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) If you repent, pray to him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#014">Job 11:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 11:14</a></font></span></p>If iniquity [be] in thine (h) hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Renounce your own evil works and see that they do not offend God, over whom you have charge.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015">Job 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 11:15</a></font></span></p>For then shalt thou lift up thy (i) face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He declares the quietness of conscience and success in all things that they shall have who turn to God in true repentance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020">Job 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 11:20</a></font></span></p>But the eyes (k) of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope [shall be as] the giving up of the ghost. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He shows that contrary things will come to them who do not repent.
