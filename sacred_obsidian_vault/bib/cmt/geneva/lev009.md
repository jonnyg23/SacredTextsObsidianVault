 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">lev 9:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass on the (a) eighth day, [that] Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) After their consecration: for the seven days before, the priests were consecrated.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002">Leviticus 9:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lev 9:2</a></font></span></p>And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a (b) sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Aaron enters into the possession of the priesthood: and offers the four principal sacrifices, the burnt offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, and the meat offering.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#005">Leviticus 9:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">lev 9:5</a></font></span></p>And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the (c) LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Before the altar where his glory appeared.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007">Leviticus 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">lev 9:7</a></font></span></p>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for (d) thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Read for the understanding of this peace, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#005">Heb 4:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027">Heb 7:27</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">lev 9:10</a></font></span></p>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he (e) burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, he laid them in order, and so they were burnt when the Lord sent down fire.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#014">Leviticus 9:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lev 9:14</a></font></span></p>And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and (f) burnt [them] upon the burnt offering on the altar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) All this must be understood of the preparation of the sacrifices which were burnt after, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024">Lev 9:24</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#021">Leviticus 9:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">lev 9:21</a></font></span></p>And the (g) breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Of the bullock and the ram.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022">Leviticus 9:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">lev 9:22</a></font></span></p>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and (h) came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Because the altar was near the sanctuary, which was the upper end, therefore he is said to come down.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Or prayed for the people.
