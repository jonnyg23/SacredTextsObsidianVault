 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001">Psalms 91:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 91:1</a></font></span></p>He that dwelleth in the (a) secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He who makes God his defence and trust will perceive his protection to be a most sure safeguard.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#002">Psalms 91:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 91:2</a></font></span></p>(b) I will say of the LORD, [He is] my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Being assured of this protection, he prays to the Lord.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003">Psalms 91:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 91:3</a></font></span></p>Surely he shall deliver thee from the (c) snare of the fowler, [and] from the noisome pestilence. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, God's help is most ready for us, whether Satan assails us secretly which he calls a snare, or openly which is here meant by the pestilence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004">Psalms 91:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 91:4</a></font></span></p>He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his (d) truth [shall be thy] shield and buckler. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, his faithful keeping of promises to help you in your need.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005">Psalms 91:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 91:5</a></font></span></p>(e) Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; [nor] for the arrow [that] flieth by day; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The care that God has over his is sufficient to defend them from all dangers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#008">Psalms 91:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 91:8</a></font></span></p>Only with thine (f) eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The godly will have some experience of God's judgements against the wicked even in this life, but they will see it fully at that day when all things will be revealed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011">Psalms 91:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 91:11</a></font></span></p>(g) For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God has not appointed one angel to every man, but many to be ministers of his providence to keep and defend his in their calling, which is the way to walk in without tempting God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013">Psalms 91:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 91:13</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the (h) young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) You will not only be preserved from all evil, but overcome it whether it is secret or open.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#014">Psalms 91:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 91:14</a></font></span></p>(i) Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) To assure the faithful of God's protection, he brings in God to confirm the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016">Psalms 91:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 91:16</a></font></span></p>With (k) long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) For he is content with that life that God gives for by death the shortness of this life is recompensed with immortality.
