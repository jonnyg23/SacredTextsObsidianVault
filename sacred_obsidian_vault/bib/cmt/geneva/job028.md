 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#001">Job 28:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 28:1</a></font></span></p>Surely there is a vein for the silver, (a) and a place for gold [where] they fine [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) His purpose is to declare that man may attain in this world to various secrets of nature, but man is never able to comprehend the wisdom of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#003">Job 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 28:3</a></font></span></p>He setteth an end to darkness, (b) and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) There is nothing but it is compassed within certain limits, and has an end, but God's wisdom.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004">Job 28:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 28:4</a></font></span></p>The flood breaketh out from the (c) inhabitant; [even the waters] (d) forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning, him that dwells by it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#005">Job 28:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 28:5</a></font></span></p>[As for] the earth, out of it cometh (e) bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, come and underneath is brimstone or coal, which easily conceives fire.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#006">Job 28:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 28:6</a></font></span></p>The stones of it [are] the place (f) of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He alludes to the mines and secrets of nature, which are under the earth, into which neither souls nor beasts can enter.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#009">Job 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 28:9</a></font></span></p>He putteth forth his hand upon the (g) rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) After he has declared the wisdom of God in the secrets of nature he describes his power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012">Job 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 28:12</a></font></span></p>But where shall wisdom be found? (h) and where [is] the place of understanding? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Though God's power and wisdom may be understood in earthly things, yet his heavenly wisdom cannot be attained to.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#013">Job 28:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 28:13</a></font></span></p>Man knoweth not (i) the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) It is too high a thing for man to attain to in this world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015">Job 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 28:15</a></font></span></p>It cannot be gotten for (k) gold, neither shall silver be weighed [for] the price thereof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) It can neither be bought for gold nor precious stones, but is only the gift of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018">Job 28:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 28:18</a></font></span></p>No mention shall be made of coral, or of (l) pearls: for the price of wisdom [is] above rubies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which was thought to be a king of precious stone.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#021">Job 28:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 28:21</a></font></span></p>Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the (m) fowls of the air. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Meaning that there is no natural means by which man can attain heavenly wisdom: which he means by the souls, that fly high.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#023">Job 28:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 28:23</a></font></span></p>God understandeth the (n) way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) He makes God the only author of this wisdom, and the giver of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028">Job 28:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 28:28</a></font></span></p>And unto man he said, Behold, the (o) fear of the Lord, that [is] wisdom; and to depart from evil [is] understanding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) He declares that man has as much of this heavenly wisdom as he shows by fearing God and departing from evil.
