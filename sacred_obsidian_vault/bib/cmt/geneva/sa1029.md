 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 29:2</a></font></span></p>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by (a) hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) According to their bands, or ensigns. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa1 29:3</a></font></span></p>Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do] these Hebrews [here]? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, [Is] not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, (b) or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell [unto me] unto this day? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, a long time, that is, four months and certain days, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#007">Sa1 27:7</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 29:4</a></font></span></p>And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? [should it] not [be] with the (c) heads of these men? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Would not Saul receive him to favour, if he would betray us? 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 29:6</a></font></span></p>Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, [as] the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy (d) going out and thy coming in with me in the host [is] good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, was conversant with me. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 29:8</a></font></span></p>And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may (e) not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) This deception cannot be excused, for it grieved him to go against the people of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">sa1 29:10</a></font></span></p>Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy (f) master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) With them that fled to thee from Saul.
