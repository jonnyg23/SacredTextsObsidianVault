 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">kg1 17:1</a></font></span></p>And Elijah the Tishbite, [who was] of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, [As] the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I (a) stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but (b) according to my word. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, whom I serve. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) But as I will declare it by God's revelation. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg1 17:4</a></font></span></p>And it shall be, [that] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the (c) ravens to feed thee there. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) To strengthen his faith against persecution, God promises to feed him miraculously. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#008">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">kg1 17:8</a></font></span></p>And the (d) word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) As the troubles of the saints of God are many, so his mercy is always at hand to deliver them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#010">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg1 17:10</a></font></span></p>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman [was] there (e) gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) All this was to strengthen the faith of Elijah, to the intent that he would look for nothing worldly, but only trust God's providence. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">kg1 17:12</a></font></span></p>And she said, [As] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and (f) die. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For there is no hope of any more sustenance. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg1 17:14</a></font></span></p>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, (g) The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day [that] the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God receives no benefit for the use of his own, but he promises an ample recompence for them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#015">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">kg1 17:15</a></font></span></p>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat (h) [many] days. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, till he had rain and food on the earth. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg1 17:17</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass after these things, [that] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no (i) breath left in him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) God would test whether she had learned by his merciful providence to make him her only stay and comfort. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#020">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">kg1 17:20</a></font></span></p>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also (k) brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He was afraid lest God's name be blasphemed and his ministry contemned, unless he continued his mercies as he had begun them, especially while he remained there. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024">3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">kg1 17:24</a></font></span></p>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this (l) I know that thou [art] a man of God, [and] that the word of the LORD in thy mouth [is] truth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) It is hard to depend on God, unless we are confirmed by miracles.
