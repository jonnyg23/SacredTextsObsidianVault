 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001">Proverbs 9:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 9:1</a></font></span></p>Wisdom hath built her (a) house, she hath hewn out her (b) seven pillars: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Christ has prepared him a Church. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, many chief supports and principal parts of his Church, as were the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, pastors and teachers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002">Proverbs 9:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 9:2</a></font></span></p>She hath killed her beasts; she hath mixed her wine; she hath also (c) furnished her table. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He compares wisdom with great princes who keep open house for all who come.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003">Proverbs 9:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pro 9:3</a></font></span></p>She hath sent forth her (d) maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Meaning, true preachers, who are not infected with man's wisdom.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004">Proverbs 9:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">pro 9:4</a></font></span></p>Whoever [is] (e) simple, let him turn in here: [as for] him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He who knows his own ignorance, and is void of malice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005">Proverbs 9:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">pro 9:5</a></font></span></p>Come, eat of my (f) bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mixed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) By meat and drink is meant the word of God, and the ministration of the sacraments, by which God nourishes his servants in his house which is the Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007">Proverbs 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">pro 9:7</a></font></span></p>He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [man getteth] himself a (g) blot. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For the wicked will contemn him and labour to defame him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008">Proverbs 9:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pro 9:8</a></font></span></p>Reprove not a (h) scorner, lest he shall hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Meaning them who are incorrigible, which Christ calls dogs and swine: or he speaks this in comparison, not that the wicked should not be rebuked, but he shows their malice, and the small hope of the profit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010">Proverbs 9:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 9:10</a></font></span></p>The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the Holy One [is] (i) understanding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He shows what true understanding is, to know the will of God in his word which is meant by holy things.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012">Proverbs 9:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">pro 9:12</a></font></span></p>If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for (k) thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) You will have the chief profit and convenience of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013">Proverbs 9:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 9:13</a></font></span></p>A (l) foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knoweth nothing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) By the foolish woman, some understand the wicked preachers, who counterfeit the word of God: as appears in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016">Pro 9:16</a>) which were the words of the true preachers as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004">Pro 9:4</a>) but their doctrine is as stolen waters: meaning that they are men's traditions, which are more pleasant to the flesh than the word of God, and therefore they themselves boast of it.
