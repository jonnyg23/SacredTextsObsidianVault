 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#002">Numbers 23:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">num 23:2</a></font></span></p>And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and (a) Balak and Balaam offered on [every] altar a bullock and a ram. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) For among the Gentiles the kings often used to sacrifice, as did the priests.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004">Numbers 23:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 23:4</a></font></span></p>And God (b) met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon [every] altar a bullock and a ram. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Appeared to him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005">Numbers 23:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 23:5</a></font></span></p>And the LORD (c) put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Taught him what to say.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007">Numbers 23:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 23:7</a></font></span></p>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, [saying], Come, curse me Jacob, and come, (d) defy Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Cause everyone to hate and detest them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009">Numbers 23:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 23:9</a></font></span></p>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the (e) nations. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) But shall have religion and laws apart.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010">Numbers 23:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">num 23:10</a></font></span></p>Who can count the (f) dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth [part] of Israel? Let me (g) die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The infinite multitude, as the dust of the earth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) The fear of God's judgment caused him to wish to be joined to the household of Abraham: thus the wicked have their consciences wounded when they consider God's judgments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019">Numbers 23:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">num 23:19</a></font></span></p>(h) God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) God's enemies are compelled to confess that his government is just, constant, and without change or repentance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021">Numbers 23:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">num 23:21</a></font></span></p>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God [is] with him, and the (i) shout of a king [is] among them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) They triumph as victorious kings over their enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023">Numbers 23:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">num 23:23</a></font></span></p>Surely [there is] no enchantment against Jacob, neither [is there] any divination against Israel: (k) according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Considering what God will work this time for the deliverance of his people, all the world will wonder.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#027">Numbers 23:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">num 23:27</a></font></span></p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another (l) place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Thus the wicked imagine of God that what he will not grant in one place, he will do in another.
