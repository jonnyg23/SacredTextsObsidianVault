 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">rut 4:1</a></font></span></p>Then went Boaz up to the (a) gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, (b) Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which was the place of judgment. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) The Hebrews here use two words which have no proper meaning, but serve to denote a certain person, as we would say, "Ho, so-and-so".

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">rut 4:4</a></font></span></p>And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy [it] before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem [it]: but if thou wilt not redeem [it, then] tell me, that I may know: for [there is] none to redeem [it] (c) beside thee; and I [am] after thee. And he said, I will redeem [it]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) For you are the next of kin.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005">Ruth 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">rut 4:5</a></font></span></p>Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his (d) inheritance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That his inheritance might bear his name that is dead.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007">Ruth 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">rut 4:7</a></font></span></p>Now this [was the manner] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbour: and this [was] a (e) testimony in Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That he had resigned his right, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009">Deu 25:9</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">rut 4:11</a></font></span></p>And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in (g) Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Ephratah and Bethlehem are both one.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014">Ruth 4:14</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He shall leave continual posterity.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning, many sons.
