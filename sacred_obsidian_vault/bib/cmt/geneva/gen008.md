 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001">Genesis 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 8:1</a></font></span></p>And God (a) remembered Noah, and (b) every living thing, and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Not that God forgets his at any time, but when he sends comfort then he shows that he remembers them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) If God remembered every brute beast, that ought also to assure his children.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#004">Genesis 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 8:4</a></font></span></p>And the ark rested in the (c) seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Part of September and part of October.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005">Genesis 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 8:5</a></font></span></p>And the waters decreased continually until the (d) tenth month: in the tenth [month], on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Which was the month of December.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#009">Genesis 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 8:9</a></font></span></p>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he (e) put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The raven flew to and fro, resting on the ark, but did not come into it, unlike the dove that was taken in.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011">Genesis 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 8:11</a></font></span></p>And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an (f) olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which was a sign that the waters were much diminished: for the olives do not grow on the high mountains.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013">Genesis 8:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 8:13</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the (g) first [month], the first [day] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Called in Hebrew Abib, part of March and part of April.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#016">Genesis 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 8:16</a></font></span></p>(h) Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Noah declares his obedience, in that he would not leave the ark without God's express commandment, as he did not enter in without the same: the ark being a figure of the Church, in which nothing must be done outside the word of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020">Genesis 8:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 8:20</a></font></span></p>And Noah (i) builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) For sacrifices which were as an exercise of their faith, by which they used to give thanks to God for his benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021">Genesis 8:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">gen 8:21</a></font></span></p>And the LORD smelled a (k) sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, by it he showed himself appeased and his anger at rest.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022">Genesis 8:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">gen 8:22</a></font></span></p>While the earth remaineth, (l) seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The order of nature destroyed by the flood, is restored by God's promise.
