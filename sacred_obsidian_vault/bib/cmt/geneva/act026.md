 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002">Acts 26:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">act 26:2</a></font></span></p>(1) I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) To have a skilful judge is a great and singular gift of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004">Acts 26:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">act 26:4</a></font></span></p>(2) My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Paul divides the history of his life into two times: for the first he calls his adversaries as witnesses: for the latter, the fathers and Prophets.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005">Acts 26:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 26:5</a></font></span></p>Which (a) knew me from (b) the beginning, if they would testify, that after the (c) most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That I was, and where, and how I lived. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) That my parents were Pharisees. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) The sect of the Pharisees was the most exquisite amongst all the sects of the Jews, for it was better than all the rest.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006">Acts 26:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">act 26:6</a></font></span></p>(3) And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) There are three chief and principal witnesses of true doctrine: God, the true fathers, and the consent of the true Church of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008">Acts 26:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">act 26:8</a></font></span></p>(4) Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) He proves the resurrection of the dead, first by the power of God, then by the resurrection of Christ, of which he is a sufficient witness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010">Acts 26:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">act 26:10</a></font></span></p>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave (d) my voice against [them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) I consented to and allowed their actions: for he was not a judge.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011">Acts 26:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">act 26:11</a></font></span></p>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and (e) compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By extreme punishment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018">Acts 26:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 26:18</a></font></span></p>(5) To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The end of the Gospel is to save those who are brought to the knowledge of Christ, and are justified and sanctified in him, being laid hold on by faith.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019">Acts 26:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">act 26:19</a></font></span></p>(6) Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) Paul alleges God to be author of the office of his apostleship, and that God's grace is a witness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022">Acts 26:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">act 26:22</a></font></span></p>(7) Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to (f) small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) Christ is the end of the Law and the Prophets. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) To everyone.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023">Acts 26:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">act 26:23</a></font></span></p>That Christ should (g) suffer, [and] that he should be the (h) first that should rise from the dead, and should shew (i) light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That Christ would not be such a king as the Jews dreamed of, but one appointed to bear our miseries, and the punishment of our sins. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) The first of those who are raised from the dead. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Life, yea and that a most blessed life which will be endless: and this is set against darkness, which almost in all languages sometimes signifies death, and sometimes misery and calamity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024">Acts 26:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">act 26:24</a></font></span></p>(8) And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) The wisdom of God is madness to fools, yet nonetheless we must boldly confirm the truth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026">Acts 26:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">act 26:26</a></font></span></p>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a (k) corner. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Secretly and privately.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027">Acts 26:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">act 26:27</a></font></span></p>(9) King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(9) Paul, as it were forgetting that he stood a prisoner to defend his cause, does not forget the office of his apostleship.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029">Acts 26:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">act 26:29</a></font></span></p>And Paul said, (l) I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) I would to God that not only almost, but thoroughly and altogether, both you and all that hear me this day, might be made as I am, only except for my bonds.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#030">Acts 26:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">act 26:30</a></font></span></p>(10) And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(10) Paul is solemnly acquitted, and yet not dismissed.
