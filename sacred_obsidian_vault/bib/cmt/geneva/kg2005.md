 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">kg2 5:1</a></font></span></p>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given (a) deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, [but he was] a leper. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Here it appears that among the infidels God has his, and also that the infidels esteem those who do good to their country. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#003">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">kg2 5:3</a></font></span></p>And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord [were] with the (b) prophet that [is] in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning Elisha. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#004">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg2 5:4</a></font></span></p>And (c) [one] went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that [is] of the land of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, Naaman told it to the king of Syria. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg2 5:5</a></font></span></p>And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and (d) took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) To give this as a present to the prophets. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">kg2 5:8</a></font></span></p>And it was [so], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, (e) Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The prophet rebukes the king because he did not consider that God was true in his promise, and therefore would not leave his Church destitute of a prophet, whose prayers he would hear, and to whom others could have recourse for comfort. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">kg2 5:11</a></font></span></p>But Naaman was (f) wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Man's reason murmurs when it considers only the signs and outward things, and has no regard for the word of God, which is contained there. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">kg2 5:13</a></font></span></p>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, (g) My father, [if] the prophet had bid thee [do some] great thing, wouldest thou not have done [it]? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This declares that servants should reverence and love their masters as children their fathers, and likewise masters toward their servants, must be affectioned as toward their children. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">kg2 5:16</a></font></span></p>But he said, [As] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it]; (h) but he refused. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) So the Lord commands that they that receive freely, should also give freely. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg2 5:18</a></font></span></p>In this thing the LORD (i) pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He feels his conscience is wounded by being present at idols service, and therefore desires God to forgive him, lest others by his example might fall to idolatry: for as for his own part he confesses that he will never serve any but the true God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#019">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">kg2 5:19</a></font></span></p>And he said unto him, (k) Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The prophet did not approve his act, but after the common manner of speech he bids him farewell. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#021">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg2 5:21</a></font></span></p>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him, (l) he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, [Is] all well? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Declaring by it, the honour and affection he bore to the prophet his master. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#024">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">kg2 5:24</a></font></span></p>And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and (m) they departed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Naaman's servants. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">kg2 5:26</a></font></span></p>And he said unto him, (n) Went not mine heart [with thee], when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and (o) oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Was I not present with you in spirit? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, money to buy possessions with: meaning that it is detestable in the servants of God to have covetous minds. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027">4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">kg2 5:27</a></font></span></p>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy (p) seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) To be an example to all, by whose covetousness God's word might be slandered.
