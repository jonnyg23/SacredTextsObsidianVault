 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001">Zechariah 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 13:1</a></font></span></p>In that day there (a) shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows what will be the fruit of their repentance, that is, remission of sins by the blood of Christ, which will be a continual running fountain, and purge them from all uncleanness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002">Zechariah 13:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">zac 13:2</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, [that] I will cut off the (b) names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the (c) prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He promises that God will also purge them from all superstition, and that their religion will be pure. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning, the false prophets and teachers, who are the corrupters of all religion, whom the Prophet here calls unclean spirits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003">Zechariah 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zac 13:3</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass, [that] when any shall yet (d) prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say to him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him (e) shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, when they will prophesy lies, and make God, who is the author of truth, a cloak for them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows what zeal the godly will have under the kingdom of Christ; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006">Deu 13:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009">Deu 13:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004">Zechariah 13:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">zac 13:4</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the prophets shall (f) be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) God will make them ashamed of their errors and lies, and bring them to repentance, and they will no more wear prophet's apparel to make their doctrine seem more holy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#005">Zechariah 13:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 13:5</a></font></span></p>But he shall say, I [am] no (g) prophet, I [am] a farmer; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) They will confess their former ignorance, and be content to labour for their living.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#006">Zechariah 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 13:6</a></font></span></p>And [one] shall say to him, What [are] these (h) wounds in thy hands? Then he shall answer, [Those] with which I was wounded [in] the house of my friends. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) By this he shows that though their parents and friends dealt more gently with them, and did not put them to death, yet they would so punish their children that became false prophets, that the marks and signs would remain forever.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007">Zechariah 13:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 13:7</a></font></span></p>Awake, O sword, against my (i) shepherd, and against the man [that is] my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand upon the little ones. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) The Prophet warns the Jews, that before this great comfort under Christ would come, there would be a horrible dissipation among the people: for their governors and pastors would be destroyed, and the people would be as scattered sheep. And the evangelist applies this to Christ, because he was the head of all pastors; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031">Mat 26:31</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008">Zechariah 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 13:8</a></font></span></p>And it shall come to pass, [that] in all the land, saith the LORD, (k) two parts in it shall be cut off [and] die; but the third shall be left in it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The greatest part will have no portion of these blessings, and yet they that will enjoy them will be tried with great afflictions, so that is will be known that only God's power and his mercies preserve them.
