 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Geneva Bible Translation Notes</i>, [1599], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luke Chapter 10</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luke 10:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">luk 10:1</a></font></span></p>After (1) these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) The seventy are sent as the second forewarners of the coming of Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003">Luke 10:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">luk 10:3</a></font></span></p>(2) Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The faithful ministers of the word are in this world as lambs among wolves: but if they are diligent to do their duty, he who sent them will also preserve them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004">Luke 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">luk 10:4</a></font></span></p>Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute (a) no man by the way. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This is spoken figuratively, which manner of speech men use when they put down more in words than is meant. This is usual among the Hebrews when they command a thing to be done speedily without delay, as is found in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029">Kg2 4:29</a>); for in any other case courteous and gentle salutations are matters of Christian duty: as for the calling, it was only for a limited time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006">Luke 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">luk 10:6</a></font></span></p>And if (b) the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) So say the Hebrews: that is, he that favours the doctrine of peace and embraces it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007">Luke 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">luk 10:7</a></font></span></p>And in the same house (c) remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Take up your lodging in that house which you enter into first, that is, do not be concerned about comfortable lodging, as men do who plan to stay in a place a long time: for here that solemn preaching of the gospel, which was used afterward when the Churches were settled, is not instituted: but these are sent abroad to all the coasts of Judea to show them that the last jubilee is at hand.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#008">Luke 10:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">luk 10:8</a></font></span></p>And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, (d) eat such things as are set before you: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Be content with the food that is set before you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#010">Luke 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">luk 10:10</a></font></span></p>(3) But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) God is a most severe avenger of the ministry of his gospel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017">Luke 10:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">luk 10:17</a></font></span></p>(4) And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us (e) through thy name. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) Neither the gift of miracles, neither any other excellent gift, but only our election gives us an occasion of true joy. And only the publishing of the gospel is the destruction of Satan. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) For Christ's disciples used no absolute authority, but performed the miracles they did by calling upon Christ's name.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018">Luke 10:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">luk 10:18</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning (f) fall from heaven. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Paul writes that the location of the devil and his angels is in the air, as is found in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012">Eph 6:12</a>), and he is said to be cast down from there by force, when his power is abolished by the voice of the Gospel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019">Luke 10:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">luk 10:19</a></font></span></p>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means (g) hurt you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Will do you wrong.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021">Luke 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">luk 10:21</a></font></span></p>(5) In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the (h) wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The Church is contemptible, if we consider its outward appearance, but the wisdom of God is most marvellous in it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) Of this world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022">Luke 10:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">luk 10:22</a></font></span></p>(6) All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and [he] to whom the Son will reveal [him]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) Whoever seeks the Father without the Son wanders out of the way.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#023">Luke 10:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">luk 10:23</a></font></span></p>(7) And he turned him unto [his] disciples, and said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that ye see: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) The difference between the Old Testament and the New consists in the measure of revelation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025">Luke 10:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">luk 10:25</a></font></span></p>(8) And, behold, (i) a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) Faith does not take away but establishes the doctrine of the law. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) One of those who proclaimed himself to be learned in the rites and laws of Moses.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029">Luke 10:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">luk 10:29</a></font></span></p>(9) But he, willing (k) to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(9) The law defines our neighbour as anyone at all that we may help. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, to vouch his righteousness, or show that he was just, that is, void of all faults: and (Jam. 5:1-20) uses the word of justification in this sense.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038">Luke 10:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">luk 10:38</a></font></span></p>(10) Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(10) Christ does not desire to be waited upon in a delicate manner, but to be heard diligently; this is that which he especially requires.
