 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Many hold the virtue of Christ in admiration, and yet they will not lose even the least thing they have in order to redeem it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030">Mat 8:30</a>

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Literally, "in an unclean spirit"; now they are said to be in the spirit because the spirit holds them tightly locked up, and as it were bound.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mar 5:7</a></font></span></p>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of the most high God? I (c) adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mar 5:11</a></font></span></p>Now there was there nigh unto the (e) mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) This whole country is for the most part very hilly, for the mountains of Galeed run through it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013">Mark 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mar 5:13</a></font></span></p>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the (f) sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Strabo in the sixteenth book says that in Gadaris there is a standing pool of very polluted water, which if beasts taste, they shed their hair, nails, or hooves and horns.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The whole company did not assemble without any structure, but in every synagogue there were certain men who governed the people.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mar 5:25</a></font></span></p>(2) And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Jesus being touched with true faith, although it is but weak, heals us by his virtue.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#036">Mark 5:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">mar 5:36</a></font></span></p>(3) As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) By faith fathers apprehended the promises of life even for their children.
