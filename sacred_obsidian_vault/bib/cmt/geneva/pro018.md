 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He who loves wisdom will separate himself from all impediments, and give himself wholly to seek it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002">Proverbs 18:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 18:2</a></font></span></p>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may (b) reveal itself. 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He who speaks first, is best heard from the wicked judge, but when his adversary enquires out the matter it turns to his shame.
