 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001">Ezekiel 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">eze 2:1</a></font></span></p>And (a) he said to me, (b) Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, the Lord. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, man who is but earth and ashes, which was to humble him, and cause him to consider his own state, and God's grace.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002">Ezekiel 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eze 2:2</a></font></span></p>(c) And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) So that he could not abide God's presence, till God's Spirit entered into him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005">Ezekiel 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 2:5</a></font></span></p>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that (d) there hath been a prophet among them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) This declares on the one part God's great affection toward his people, that despite their rebellion, yet he will send his prophets among them, and admonishes his ministers on the other part that they cease not to do their duty, though the people are never so obstinate: for the word of God will be either to their salvation or greater condemnation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006">Ezekiel 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eze 2:6</a></font></span></p>And thou, son of man, (e) be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns [are] with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they [are] a rebellious house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017">Jer 1:17</a>). He shows that for no afflictions they would cease to do their duties.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008">Ezekiel 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eze 2:8</a></font></span></p>But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and (f) eat that which I give thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He not only exhorts him to his duty but also gives him the means with which he may be able to execute it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010">Ezekiel 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 2:10</a></font></span></p>And he spread it before me; and it [was] written within and without: and [there was] written in it (g) lamentations, and mourning, and woe. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He shows what were the contents of this book: that is, God's judgments against the wicked.
