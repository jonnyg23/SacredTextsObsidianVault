 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He prophecies of the destruction of the Edomites and other nations which were enemies to the Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002">Isaiah 34:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 34:2</a></font></span></p>For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon all nations, and [his] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly (b) destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) God has determined in his counsel and has given sentence for their destruction.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) I have determined in my secret counsel and in the heavens to destroy them till my sword is weary with shedding blood. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) They had an opinion of holiness, because they came from the patriarch Isaac, but in effect were cursed by God, and enemies to his Church as the papists are.

 </p><p>(f) That is, both of young and old, poor and rich of his enemies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) That famous city will be consumed as a sacrifice burnt to ashes.
