 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who dare defend the truth and show mercy to the oppressed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002">Psalms 12:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 12:2</a></font></span></p>They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: [with] (b) flattering lips [and] with a double heart do they speak. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He means the flatters of the court which hurt him more with their tongues than with their weapons.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004">Psalms 12:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 12:4</a></font></span></p>Who have said, (c) With our tongue will we prevail; our lips [are] our own: who [is] lord over us? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) They think themselves able to persuade whatever they take in hand.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005">Psalms 12:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 12:5</a></font></span></p>(d) For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will (e) set [him] in safety [from him that] puffeth at him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The Lord is moved with the complaints of his, and delivers in the end from all danger. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Because the Lord's word and promise is true and unchangeable he will perform it and preserve the poor from this wicked generation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007">Psalms 12:7</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, yours though was only one man.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For they suppress the godly and maintain the wicked.
