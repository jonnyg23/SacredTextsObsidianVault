 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002">Genesis 21:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 21:2</a></font></span></p>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his (a) old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Therefore the miracle was greater.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007">Genesis 21:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">gen 21:7</a></font></span></p>And she said, (b) Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born [him] a son in his old age. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) She accuses herself of ingratitude, that she did not believe the angel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009">Genesis 21:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 21:9</a></font></span></p>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, (c) mocking. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He derided God's promise made to Isaac which the apostle calls persecution (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029">Gal 4:29</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Genesis 21:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 21:12</a></font></span></p>And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be (d) called. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The promised seed will be from Isaac, and not from Ishmael, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007">Rom 9:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#018">Heb 11:18</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013">Genesis 21:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 21:13</a></font></span></p>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make (e) a nation, because he [is] thy seed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The Ishmaelites will come from him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014">Genesis 21:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 21:14</a></font></span></p>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and (f) sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) True faith renounces all natural affections to obey God's commandment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017">Genesis 21:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">gen 21:17</a></font></span></p>And God (g) heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For his promise sake made to Abraham; and not because the child had discretion and judgment to pray.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019">Genesis 21:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">gen 21:19</a></font></span></p>And God (h) opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Unless God opens our eyes, we can neither see, nor use the means which are before us.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020">Genesis 21:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 21:20</a></font></span></p>And God was (i) with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Concerning outward things God caused him to prosper.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#024">Genesis 21:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">gen 21:24</a></font></span></p>And Abraham said, I will (k) swear. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) So that it is a lawful thing to take an oath in matters of importance, to justify the truth, and to assure others of our sincerity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#026">Genesis 21:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">gen 21:26</a></font></span></p>And Abimelech said, (l) I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I [of it], but to day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Wicked servants do many evils unknown to their masters.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#032">Genesis 21:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">gen 21:32</a></font></span></p>Thus they made a (m) covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Thus we see that the godly, concerning outward things may make peace with the wicked that do not know the true God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033">Genesis 21:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">gen 21:33</a></font></span></p>And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beersheba, and (n) called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, he worshipped God in all points of true religion.
