 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lev 25:3</a></font></span></p>(a) Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The Jews began to count the year in September: for then all the fruits were gathered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#005">Leviticus 25:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">lev 25:5</a></font></span></p>That which groweth of its (b) own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine (c) undressed: [for] it is a year of rest unto the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Because of the corn that fell out of the ears the previous year. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Or, which you have separated from yourself, and consecrated to God for the poor.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That which the land brings forth in her rest.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">lev 25:9</a></font></span></p>(e) Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth [day] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In the beginning of the 50 years was the Jubile, so called, because the joyful tidings of liberty were publicly proclaimed by the sound of a cornet.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010">Leviticus 25:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">lev 25:10</a></font></span></p>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the (f) inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his (g) possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) If the Jubile to come is near, you would be better to sell cheaply. If it is far off, sell at a higher price.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#016">Leviticus 25:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">lev 25:16</a></font></span></p>According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for [according] to the number [of the years] of the (k) fruits doth he sell unto thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) And not the full possession of the land.

 <p>
 </p><p>(p) That is, for ever, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023">Lev 25:23</a>).
