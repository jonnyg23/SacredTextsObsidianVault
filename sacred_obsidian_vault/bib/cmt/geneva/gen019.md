 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001">Genesis 19:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 19:1</a></font></span></p>And there came two (a) angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing [them] rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) In which we see God's provident care in preserving his: even though he does not reveal himself to all alike: for Lot had but two angels, and Abraham three.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003">Genesis 19:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">gen 19:3</a></font></span></p>And (b) he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they (c) did eat. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, he begged them so insistently. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Not because they had need, but because the time was not yet come for them to reveal themselves.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004">Genesis 19:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 19:4</a></font></span></p>But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, (d) all the people from every quarter: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Nothing is more dangerous than to live where sin reigns: for it corrupts all.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008">Genesis 19:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">gen 19:8</a></font></span></p>Behold now, I have two (e) daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; (f) for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He deserves praise for defending his guests, but he is to be blamed for seeking unlawful means. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That I should preserve them from all injury.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#013">Genesis 19:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 19:13</a></font></span></p>For (g) we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This proves that the angels are ministers, both to execute God's wrath and to declare his favour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016">Genesis 19:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 19:16</a></font></span></p>And while he (h) lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The mercy of God strives to overcome man's slowness in following God's calling.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017">Genesis 19:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">gen 19:17</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; (i) look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He willed him to flee God's judgments and not to be sorry to leave that rich country, full of vain pleasures.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#020">Genesis 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 19:20</a></font></span></p>Behold now, this city [is] near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is] it not a (k) little one?) and my soul shall live. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Though it is little, yet it is great enough to save my life: in which he errs by choosing another place than the angel had appointed him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022">Genesis 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">gen 19:22</a></font></span></p>Haste thee, escape thither; for I (l) cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called (m) Zoar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Because God's commandment was to destroy the city and to save Lot. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Which before was called Belah, in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#002">Gen 14:2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026">Genesis 19:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">gen 19:26</a></font></span></p>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a (n) pillar of salt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Concerning the body only: this was a notable monument of God's vengeance to all who passed that way.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030">Genesis 19:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">gen 19:30</a></font></span></p>And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he (o) feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Having felt God's mercy, he did not dare provoke him again by continuing among the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031">Genesis 19:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">gen 19:31</a></font></span></p>And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man in the (p) earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Meaning in the country which the Lord had now destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#032">Genesis 19:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">gen 19:32</a></font></span></p>Come, let us make our father (q) drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) For unless he had been drunk, he would never have done that abominable act.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#036">Genesis 19:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">gen 19:36</a></font></span></p>Thus were (r) both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Thus God permitted him to fall most horribly in the solitary mountains, whom the wickedness of Sodom could not overcome.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037">Genesis 19:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">gen 19:37</a></font></span></p>And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is] the father of the (s) Moabites unto this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Who as they were born in most horrible incest, so were they and their posterity vile and wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#038">Genesis 19:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">gen 19:38</a></font></span></p>And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name (t) Benammi: the same [is] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) That is, son of my people: signifying that they rejoiced in their sin, rather than repenting of it.
