 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001">Judges 17:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jdg 17:1</a></font></span></p>And there (a) was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name [was] Micah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Some think this history was in the time of Othniel, or as Josephus writes, immediately after Joshua.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#003">Judges 17:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jdg 17:3</a></font></span></p>And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a (b) graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Contrary to the commandment of God and true religion practised under Joshua, they forsook the Lord and fell into idolatry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005">Judges 17:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jdg 17:5</a></font></span></p>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an (c) ephod, and (d) teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He would serve both God and idols. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) By Teraphim some understand certain idols, having the likeness of a man, but others understand by it all manner of things and instruments belonging to those who sought an answer at God's hands, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#005">Jdg 18:5-6</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006">Judges 17:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jdg 17:6</a></font></span></p>In those days [there was] no (e) king in Israel, [but] every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For where there is no Magistrate fearing God, there can be no true religion or order.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007">Judges 17:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jdg 17:7</a></font></span></p>And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah (f) of the family of Judah, who [was] a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which Bethlehem was in the tribe of Judah.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#009">Judges 17:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jdg 17:9</a></font></span></p>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, (g) I [am] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For in those days the service of God was corrupt in all estates and the Levites were not looked to.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#011">Judges 17:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jdg 17:11</a></font></span></p>And the Levite was (h) content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Not considering that he forsook the true worship of God to maintain his own belly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#013">Judges 17:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jdg 17:13</a></font></span></p>Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me (i) good, seeing I have a Levite to [my] priest. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Thus the idolaters persuade themselves of God's favour, when indeed he detests them.
