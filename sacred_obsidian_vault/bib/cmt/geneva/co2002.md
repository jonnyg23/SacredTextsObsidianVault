 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001">2 Corinthians 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co2 2:1</a></font></span></p>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in (a) heaviness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Causing grief among you, which he would have done if he had come to them before they had repented. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003">2 Corinthians 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co2 2:3</a></font></span></p>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having (b) confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) For I trusted that you would immediately take that out of the way which you knew I was discontented with, considering how you are persuaded that my joy is your joy. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005">2 Corinthians 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co2 2:5</a></font></span></p>(1) But if any have caused grief, he hath not (c) grieved me, but (d) in part: that I may not (e) overcharge you all. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) He passes to another part of this epistle: which nonetheless is put among the first, and to which he returns afterwards: and he handles the releasing and unloosing of the incestuous person, because he seemed to have been given sufficient testimony of his repentance. And this shows the true use of excommunication, that is, that it proceeds not from hatred, but from love, and so end, lest if we keep it up, we serve Satan the devil. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) As if he said, "All that sorrow is so completely wiped away, that I have never felt it." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) As for me, says Paul, I have no more to do with him. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Lest I should overcharge him who is burdened enough as it is, which burden I would be glad if it were taken from him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007">2 Corinthians 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co2 2:7</a></font></span></p>So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to (f) forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That whereas before you punished him sharply, you should now forgive him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008">2 Corinthians 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co2 2:8</a></font></span></p>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would (g) confirm [your] love toward him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That at my entreaty you would declare by the consent of the whole church, that you take him again as a brother. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010">2 Corinthians 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co2 2:10</a></font></span></p>To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the (h) person of Christ; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Truly, and from the heart. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011">2 Corinthians 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co2 2:11</a></font></span></p>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his (i) devices. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Of his mischievous counsel and devilish will. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012">2 Corinthians 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co2 2:12</a></font></span></p>(2) Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) He returns to the confirmation of his apostleship, and brings forth both the testimonies of his labours, and also of God's blessing. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014">2 Corinthians 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">co2 2:14</a></font></span></p>Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the (k) savour of his knowledge by us in every place. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He alludes to the anointing of the priests, and the incense of the sacrifices. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015">2 Corinthians 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co2 2:15</a></font></span></p>(3) For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) He denies that anything should be taken away from the dignity of his apostleship, because they saw that it was not received with like success in every place. But rather very many rejected and detested him, seeing that he preached Christ not only as a saviour of those that believe, but also as a judge of those that condemn him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016">2 Corinthians 2:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">co2 2:16</a></font></span></p>To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. (4) And who [is] sufficient for these things? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) Again, he dismisses all suspicion of arrogance, attributing all things that he did to the power of God, whom he serves sincerely, and with honest affection. And he makes them witnesses of this, even to the sixth verse of the next chapter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017">Co2 2:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">Co2 3:6</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017">2 Corinthians 2:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co2 2:17</a></font></span></p>For we are not as many, which (l) corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) We do not handle it craftily and covetously, or less sincerely than we ought. And he uses a metaphor, which is taken from hucksters, who used to play the false harlot with whatever came into their hands.
