 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Proverbs 19:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">pro 19:7</a></font></span></p>All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth [them (a) with] words, [yet] they [are] lacking [to him]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) To have comfort from them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008">Proverbs 19:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pro 19:8</a></font></span></p>He that getteth wisdom (b) loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He that is upright in judgment finds favour from God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010">Proverbs 19:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 19:10</a></font></span></p>(c) Delight is not proper for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The free use of things are not to be permitted to him who cannot use them correctly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011">Proverbs 19:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">pro 19:11</a></font></span></p>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and [it is] his glory (d) to pass over a transgression. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, to cover it by charity, and to do in it as may most serve to God's glory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013">Proverbs 19:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 19:13</a></font></span></p>A foolish son [is] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife [are] a continual (e) dropping. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) As rain that drops and rots the house.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019">Proverbs 19:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">pro 19:19</a></font></span></p>A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou (f) deliver [him], yet thou must do it again. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though for a time he gives place to counsel, yet soon after will he give place to his raging affections.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021">Proverbs 19:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 19:21</a></font></span></p>[There are] many devices in a (g) man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Man's device will not have success, unless God governs it, whose purpose is unchangeable.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022">Proverbs 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pro 19:22</a></font></span></p>The desire of a man [is] his (h) kindness: and a poor man [is] better than a liar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, that he be honest: for the poor man who is honest is to be esteemed above the rich who is not virtuous.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025">Proverbs 19:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">pro 19:25</a></font></span></p>Smite a scorner, and the (i) simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, the simple and ignorant men learn when they see the wicked punished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028">Proverbs 19:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">pro 19:28</a></font></span></p>An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked (k) devoureth iniquity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Takes a pleasure and delight in it, as gluttons and drunkards in delicate meats and drinks.
