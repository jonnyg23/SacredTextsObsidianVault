 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001">Matthew 1:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mat 1:1</a></font></span></p>The (1) (a) book of the (b) generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the (c) son of Abraham. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Jesus Christ came of Abraham of the tribe of Judah, and of the family of David as God promised. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) Rehearsal: as the Hebrews used to speak; see (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001">Gen 5:1</a>), the book of the generations. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Of the ancestors from whom Christ came. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Christ is also the son of Abraham.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011">Matthew 1:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mat 1:11</a></font></span></p>and Josias begat (d) Jechonias and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away of Babylon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, the captivity fell in the days of Jakim and Jechonias: for Jechonias was born before the carrying away into captivity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017">Matthew 1:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">mat 1:17</a></font></span></p>All (e) the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [were] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) All those who were considered to be in the lineage of David's family, as they begat one another orderly in turn.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018">Matthew 1:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">mat 1:18</a></font></span></p>Now the birth of (2) Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that is, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of [the] Holy Spirit. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) Christ is the true Emmanuel, and therefore, Jesus (that is, Saviour) is conceived in the virgin by the Holy Spirit, as foretold by the prophets.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020">Matthew 1:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mat 1:20</a></font></span></p>but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to (f) take to [thee] Mary, thy (g) wife, for that which is (h) begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Receive her from her parents and kinsfolks hands. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) Who was promised, and made sure to you to be your wife. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) Of the mother's substance by the Holy Spirit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Matthew 1:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mat 1:21</a></font></span></p>And she shall bring forth (3) a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save (i) his people from their sins. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) Christ is born of the same virgin who never knew a man: and is named Jesus by God himself through the angel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Save, and this shows us the meaning of the name Jesus.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023">Matthew 1:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">mat 1:23</a></font></span></p>Behold, a (k) virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) There is an article added in the Hebrew and Greek text, to point out the woman and set her forth plainly: as we would say, the virgin, or a certain virgin.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025">Matthew 1:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mat 1:25</a></font></span></p>And knew her not (l) till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The word "till", in the Hebrew language, gives us to understand that a thing will not come to pass in time to come: as Michal had no children "till" her death day, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023">Sa2 6:23</a>). And in the last chapter of this evangelist: Behold, I am with you "till" the end of the world.
