 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001">Psalms 115:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 115:1</a></font></span></p>Not (a) unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, [and] for thy truth's sake. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because God promised to deliver them, not for their sakes, but for his Name, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011">Isa 48:11</a>), therefore they ground their prayer on this promise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002">Psalms 115:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 115:2</a></font></span></p>Wherefore should the heathen say, (b) Where [is] now their God? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When the wicked see that God does not always accomplish his promise as they imagined, they think there is no God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003">Psalms 115:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 115:3</a></font></span></p>But our God [is] in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath (c) pleased. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) No impediments can slow his work, but he uses even the impediments to serve his will.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004">Psalms 115:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 115:4</a></font></span></p>Their idols [are] (d) silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Seeing that neither the matter nor the form can commend their idols it follows that there is no reason that they should be esteemed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007">Psalms 115:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 115:7</a></font></span></p>They have (e) hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows what great vanity it is to ask help from them who not only have no help in them, but lack sense and reason.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008">Psalms 115:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 115:8</a></font></span></p>They that make them are (f) like unto them; [so is] every one that trusteth in them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) As much without sense as blocks and stones.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010">Psalms 115:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 115:10</a></font></span></p>(g) O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For they were appointed by God as instructors and teachers of faith and religion for others to follow.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012">Psalms 115:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 115:12</a></font></span></p>The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless [us]; he (h) will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, he will continue his graces toward his people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015">Psalms 115:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 115:15</a></font></span></p>Ye [are] blessed of the LORD which (i) made heaven and earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) And therefore still governs and continues all things in it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016">Psalms 115:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 115:16</a></font></span></p>The (k) heaven, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) And they declare enough his sufficiency so that the world serves him nothing, but to show his fatherly care toward men.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017">Psalms 115:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 115:17</a></font></span></p>The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that (l) go down into silence. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Though the dead set forth God's glory, yet he means here, that they praise him not in his Church and congregation.
