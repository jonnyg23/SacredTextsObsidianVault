 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001">Job 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 14:1</a></font></span></p>Man (a) [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days, and full of trouble. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Taking the opportunity of his adversaries words he describes the state of man's life from his birth to his death.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003">Job 14:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 14:3</a></font></span></p>And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an (b) one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) His meaning is, that seeing that man is so frail a creature, God should not handle him so extremely, in which Job shows the wickedness of the flesh, when it is not subject to the Spirit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006">Job 14:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 14:6</a></font></span></p>Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, (c) as an hireling, his day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Until the time you have appointed him to die, which he desires as the hireling waits for the end of his labour to receive his wages.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010">Job 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 14:10</a></font></span></p>(d) But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He speaks here not as though he had no hope of immortality but as a man in extreme pain, when reason is overcome by afflictions and torments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013">Job 14:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 14:13</a></font></span></p>O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy (e) wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and (f) remember me! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By this he declares that the fear of God's judgment was the reason why he desired to die. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, relieve my pain and take me to mercy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014">Job 14:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 14:14</a></font></span></p>If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till (g) my change come. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Meaning, to the day of the resurrection when he would be changed and renewed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#015">Job 14:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 14:15</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt call, and I will (h) answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Though I am afflicted in this life, yet in the resurrection I will feel your mercies and answer when you call me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017">Job 14:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 14:17</a></font></span></p>My transgression [is] sealed up in a (i) bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) You lay them all together and do not allow any of my sins to go unpunished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#018">Job 14:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 14:18</a></font></span></p>And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the (k) rock is removed out of his place. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He murmurs through the impatiency of the flesh against God, as though he used great severity against him as against the hard rocks, or waters that overflow, so that by this the opportunity of his hope is taken away.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022">Job 14:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 14:22</a></font></span></p>But his (l) flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Yet while he is in pain and misery.
