 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001">Isaiah 62:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 62:1</a></font></span></p>For Zion's sake I will not (a) hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until its righteousness shall go forth as (b) brightness, and its salvation as a lamp [that] burneth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The prophet says that he will never cease to declare to the people the good tidings of their deliverance. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Till they have full deliverance: and this the prophet speaks to encourage all other ministers to the setting forth of God's mercies toward his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002">Isaiah 62:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 62:2</a></font></span></p>And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by (c) a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) You will have a more excellent fame than you have had till now.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003">Isaiah 62:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 62:3</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt also be a (d) crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He will value you as dear and precious as a king does his crown.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004">Isaiah 62:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 62:4</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt no more be termed (e) Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be (f) married. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) You will no longer be contemned as a woman forsaken by her husband. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That it may be replenished with children.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005">Isaiah 62:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 62:5</a></font></span></p>For [as] a young man marrieth a virgin, [so] shall thy sons (g) marry thee: and [as] the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, [so] shall thy God rejoice over thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As they confess one faith and religion with you, they are in the same bond of marriage with you, and they are called the children of the Church, as Christ makes her plentiful to bring forth children to him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006">Isaiah 62:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 62:6</a></font></span></p>I have set (h) watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, [which] shall never hold their peace day nor night: (i) ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Prophets, pastors and ministers. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) He exhorts the ministers never to cease to call on God by prayer for the deliverance of his Church and to teach others to do the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007">Isaiah 62:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 62:7</a></font></span></p>And give him no rest, till he shall establish, and till he shall make Jerusalem a (k) praise in the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) For the restoration of which all the world will praise him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010">Isaiah 62:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 62:10</a></font></span></p>(l) Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Signifying the great number that would come to the Church, and what means he would prepare for the restitution of the same, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014">Isa 57:14</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011">Isaiah 62:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 62:11</a></font></span></p>Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed to the end of the world, (m) Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward [is] with him, and (n) his work before him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) You prophets and ministers show the people of this their deliverance: which was chiefly meant of our salvation by Christ, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009">Zac 9:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005">Mat 21:5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) He will have all power to bring his purpose to pass, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010">Isa 40:10</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012">Isaiah 62:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 62:12</a></font></span></p>And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A (o) city not forsaken. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, one over whom God has had a singular care to recover her when she was lost.
