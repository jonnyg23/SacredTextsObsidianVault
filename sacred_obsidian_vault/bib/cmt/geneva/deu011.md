 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">deu 11:2</a></font></span></p>And (a) know ye this day: for [I speak] not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) You who have seen God's graces with your eyes should be moved, rather than your children who have only heard of them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#005">Deuteronomy 11:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">deu 11:5</a></font></span></p>And (b) what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As well concerning his benefits, as his corrections.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#008">Deuteronomy 11:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">deu 11:8</a></font></span></p>Therefore shall ye keep (c) all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Because you have felt both his chastisement and his benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010">Deuteronomy 11:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 11:10</a></font></span></p>For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst [it] with thy (d) foot, as a garden of herbs: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By making gutters for the water to come out of the Nile river to water the land.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014">Deuteronomy 11:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">deu 11:14</a></font></span></p>That I will give [you] the rain of your land in his due season, (e) the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) In the seed time, and toward harvest.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#016">Deuteronomy 11:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">deu 11:16</a></font></span></p>Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not (f) deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) By devising foolish devotions according to your own fantasies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021">Deuteronomy 11:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">deu 11:21</a></font></span></p>That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as (g) the days of heaven upon the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As long as the heavens and earth endure, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010">Pe2 3:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012">Pe2 3:12</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024">Deuteronomy 11:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">deu 11:24</a></font></span></p>Every place whereon the soles of (h) your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost (i) sea shall your coast be. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) This was accomplished in David and Solomon's time. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) The Mediterranean.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">deu 11:28</a></font></span></p>And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not (k) known. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He reproves the malice of men who leave that which is certain to follow that which is uncertain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030">Deuteronomy 11:30</a></p>
