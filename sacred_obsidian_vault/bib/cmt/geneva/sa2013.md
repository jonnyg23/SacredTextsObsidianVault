 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa2 13:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name [was] (a) Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Tamar was Absalom's sister both by father and mother, and Amnon's only by father. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa2 13:2</a></font></span></p>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she [was] a (b) virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) And therefore kept her father's house, as virgins were accustomed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#005">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa2 13:5</a></font></span></p>And Jonadab said unto him, (c) Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see [it], and eat [it] at her hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Here we see that there is no enterprise so wicked that it cannot be encouraged to further wickedness. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa2 13:6</a></font></span></p>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of (d) cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Meaning, some delicate and dainty meat. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#009">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa2 13:9</a></font></span></p>And she took a pan, and (e) poured [them] out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from (f) me. And they went out every man from him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, she served them on a dish. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) For the wicked are ashamed to do that before men, which they are not afraid to commit in the sight of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sa2 13:13</a></font></span></p>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of (g) the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As a lewd and wicked person. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa2 13:18</a></font></span></p>And [she had] a garment of (h) divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters [that were] virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) For that which was of various colours or pieces, in those days was greatly esteemed, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003">Gen 37:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030">Jdg 5:30</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#020">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">sa2 13:20</a></font></span></p>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but (i) hold now thy peace, my sister: he [is] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) For though he conceived sudden vengeance in his heart, yet he concealed it till an opportunity arose, and comforted his sister. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">sa2 13:23</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and (k) Absalom invited all the king's sons. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, to a banquet, thinking by it to fulfil his wicked purpose. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#026">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">sa2 13:26</a></font></span></p>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother (l) Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Pretending to the king that Amnon was most dear to him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#028">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">sa2 13:28</a></font></span></p>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not (m) I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Such is the pride of the wicked masters, that in all their wicked commandments they think to be obeyed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">sa2 13:31</a></font></span></p>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the (n) earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Lamenting, as he that felt the wrath of God on his house, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#010">Sa2 12:10</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#035">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">sa2 13:35</a></font></span></p>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, (o) so it is. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That only Amnon is dead. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">sa2 13:37</a></font></span></p>But Absalom fled, and went to (p) Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) For Maachah his mother was the daughter of this Talmai, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003">Sa2 3:3</a>).
