 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#003">Job 19:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 19:3</a></font></span></p>These (a) ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed [that] ye make yourselves strange to me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, many times, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012">Neh 4:12</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#004">Job 19:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 19:4</a></font></span></p>And be it indeed [that] I have erred, mine error (b) remaineth with myself. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, I myself will be punished for it, or you have not yet consulted it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006">Job 19:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 19:6</a></font></span></p>Know now that God hath (c) overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He breaks out again into his passions and declares still that his affliction comes from God though he is not able to feel the cause in himself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#008">Job 19:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 19:8</a></font></span></p>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot (d) pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Meaning, out of his afflictions.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#009">Job 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 19:9</a></font></span></p>He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the (e) crown [from] my head. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning, his children, and whatever was dear to him in this world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#010">Job 19:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 19:10</a></font></span></p>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like (f) a tree. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which is plucked up, and has no more hope to grow.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#012">Job 19:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 19:12</a></font></span></p>His (g) troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) His manifold afflictions.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#015">Job 19:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 19:15</a></font></span></p>(h) They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) My household servants by all these losses Job shows that touching the flesh he had great opportunity to be moved.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017">Job 19:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 19:17</a></font></span></p>My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's [sake] of mine (i) own body. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Which were hers and mine.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020">Job 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 19:20</a></font></span></p>My bone (k) cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Besides these great losses and most cruel unkindness, he was touched in his own person as follows.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021">Job 19:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 19:21</a></font></span></p>Have pity upon me, have (m) pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Seeing I have these just causes to complain, condemn me not as a hypocrite, especially you who should comfort me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022">Job 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 19:22</a></font></span></p>Why do ye persecute me as (n) God, and are not satisfied with my (o) flesh? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Is it not enough that God punishes me, unless you by reproaching increase my sorrow? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) To see my body punished, unless you trouble my mind?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#024">Job 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 19:24</a></font></span></p>That they were graven with (p) an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) He protests that despite his sore passions his religion is perfect and that he in not a blasphemer as they judged him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025">Job 19:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 19:25</a></font></span></p>For I know [that] my (q) redeemer liveth, and [that] he shall stand at the latter [day] upon the earth: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) I do not so justify myself before the world, but I know that I will come before the great judge who will be my deliverer and Saviour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026">Job 19:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 19:26</a></font></span></p>And [though] after my skin [worms] destroy this [body], yet (r) in my flesh shall I see God: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) In this Job declares plainly that he had a full hope, that both the soul and body would enjoy the presence of God in the last resurrection.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028">Job 19:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 19:28</a></font></span></p>But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the (s) matter is found in me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Though his friends thought that he was only persecuted by God for his sins, yet he declares that there was a deeper consideration that is, the trial of his faith and patience, and so to be an example for others.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029">Job 19:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">job 19:29</a></font></span></p>Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath [bringeth] the (t) punishments of the sword, that ye may know [there is] a judgment. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) God will be avenged of this harsh judgment by which you condemned me.
