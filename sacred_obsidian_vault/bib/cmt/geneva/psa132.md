 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001">Psalms 132:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 132:1</a></font></span></p>A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, [and] all his (a) afflictions: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, with great difficulty he came to the kingdom, and with great zeal and care he went about to build your temple.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#003">Psalms 132:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 132:3</a></font></span></p>Surely I (b) will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Because the chief charge of the king was to set forth God's glory, he shows that he would take no rest, neither would he go about any worldly thing, were it never so necessary before he had executed his office.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005">Psalms 132:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 132:5</a></font></span></p>Until I find out a place for the (c) LORD, an habitation for the mighty [God] of Jacob. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, the ark, which was a sign of God's presence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006">Psalms 132:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 132:6</a></font></span></p>Lo, we heard of it at (d) Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The common instinct was that the ark should remain in Ephratah, that is, in Bethlehem a plentiful place: but later we perceived that you would place it in Jerusalem, which was barren as a forest and compassed about only with hills.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008">Psalms 132:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 132:8</a></font></span></p>Arise, O LORD, into thy (e) rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is Jerusalem, because later his Ark would move to no other place.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009">Psalms 132:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 132:9</a></font></span></p>Let thy priests be clothed with (f) righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Let the effect of your grace appear both in the priests and in the people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010">Psalms 132:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 132:10</a></font></span></p>For thy (g) servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As you first made promise to David, so continue it to his posterity that whatever they ask for their people, it may be granted.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012">Psalms 132:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 132:12</a></font></span></p>If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for (h) evermore. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Because this cannot be accomplished but in Christ, it follows that the promise was spiritual.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Psalms 132:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 132:14</a></font></span></p>This [is] my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have (i) desired it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning, for his own sake and not for the plentifulness of the place: for he promises to bless it, declaring before that it was barren.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016">Psalms 132:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 132:16</a></font></span></p>I will also clothe her priests with (k) salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, with my protection, by which they will be safe.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017">Psalms 132:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 132:17</a></font></span></p>There will I make the (l) horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Though his force for a time seemed to be broken, yet he promises to restore it.
