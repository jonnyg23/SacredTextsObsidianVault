 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>The Geneva Bible Translation Notes</i>, [1599], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001">Mark Chapter 8</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003">Mark 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mar 8:3</a></font></span></p>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will (a) faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Literally, "they will fall apart", or "be dissolved", for when men faint they tear their muscles.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011">Mark 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mar 8:11</a></font></span></p>(1) And the Pharisees (b) came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) The stubborn enemies of the doctrine of the Gospel, giving no credit to the miracles already done, require new ones: but Christ, being angry with them, utterly forsakes them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) A common saying which the Hebrews use, by which is meant that the Pharisees went from their houses to purposely engage him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012">Mark 8:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mar 8:12</a></font></span></p>And he (c) sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, (d) There shall no sign be given unto this generation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) These sighs came from the centre of his heart for the Lord was very much moved with the great unbelief of these men. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Literally, "If a sign be given". It is an abbreviated kind of speech very common among the Hebrews; it is the same as when we say, "Let me be taken for a liar", or something similar. And when they speak out the whole, they say, "The Lord do such and such by me."  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015">Mark 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">mar 8:15</a></font></span></p>(2) And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) We must especially take heed of those who corrupt the word of God, no matter what their position is in the Church or in civil politics.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#016">Mark 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">mar 8:16</a></font></span></p>(3) And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) They that have their minds fixed on earthly things are utterly blinded to heavenly things, even though they are plainly set before them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#021">Mark 8:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mar 8:21</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them, (c) How is it that ye do not understand? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) How does it come to pass that you do not understand these things which are so plain and evident.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022">Mark 8:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mar 8:22</a></font></span></p>(4) And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) A true image of our regeneration, which Christ, separating us from the world, works and accomplishes in us gradually.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024">Mark 8:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mar 8:24</a></font></span></p>And he looked up, and said, I (f) see men as trees, walking. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He perceived men moving but at the same time could not discern their bodies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025">Mark 8:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mar 8:25</a></font></span></p>After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him (g) look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He commanded him to try again, to determine whether or not he could indeed see well.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#026">Mark 8:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">mar 8:26</a></font></span></p>(5) And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) Christ will not have his miracles to be separated from his doctrine.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027">Mark 8:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">mar 8:27</a></font></span></p>(6) And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) Many praise Christ, who yet nonetheless rob him of his praise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#030">Mark 8:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">mar 8:30</a></font></span></p>(7) And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) Christ has appointed certain times for the preaching of the gospel, and therefore here defers it to a more appropriate time, lest sudden haste should rather hinder than further the mystery of his coming.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031">Mark 8:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">mar 8:31</a></font></span></p>(8) And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) All that Christ suffered for us he suffered not unwillingly, neither as being unaware, but foreknowing it and willingly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#032">Mark 8:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">mar 8:32</a></font></span></p>(9) And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(9) None are more mad than they that are wise without the word of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#033">Mark 8:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">mar 8:33</a></font></span></p>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou (h) savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) This is not godly, but worldly wisdom.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034">Mark 8:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">mar 8:34</a></font></span></p>(10) And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(10) The disciples of Christ must bear bravely whatever burden the Lord lays upon them, and subdue the desires of the flesh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#036">Mark 8:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">mar 8:36</a></font></span></p>(11) For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(11) They are the most foolish of all men who purchase the pleasures of this life with the loss of everlasting bliss.
