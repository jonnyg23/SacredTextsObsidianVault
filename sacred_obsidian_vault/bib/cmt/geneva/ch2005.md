 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When the things were dedicated and brought into the temple. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Called in Hebrew Ethanim, containing part of September and part of October, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002">Kg1 8:2</a>), which moves the Jews called the first month, because they say that the world was created in that month, and after they came from Egypt, they began at March: but because this opinion is uncertain, we always make March the first as the best writers do.

 </p><p>(d) For Aaron's rod and manna were taken from there before it was brought to this place.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) They all played the same tune. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) This was the effect of their songs, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001">Psa 118:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001">Psa 136:1</a>).
