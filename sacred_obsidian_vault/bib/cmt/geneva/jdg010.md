 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004">Judges 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jdg 10:4</a></font></span></p>And he had thirty sons that (a) rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which [are] in the land of Gilead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Signifying, they were men of authority.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008">Judges 10:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jdg 10:8</a></font></span></p>And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, (b) all the children of Israel that [were] on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which [is] in Gilead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010">Judges 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jdg 10:10</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel (c) cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) They prayed to the Lord, and confessed their sins.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011">Judges 10:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jdg 10:11</a></font></span></p>And the LORD (d) said unto the children of Israel, [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) By stirring them up some prophets, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008">Jdg 6:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015">Judges 10:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jdg 10:15</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, (e) this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, from this present danger.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016">Judges 10:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jdg 10:16</a></font></span></p>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and (f) served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) This is true repentance, to put away evil, and serve God aright.
