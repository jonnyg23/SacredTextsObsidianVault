 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which is a wood of long endurance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004">Deuteronomy 10:4</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When you were assembled to receive the Law.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 10:6</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to (c) Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This mountain was also called Hor, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028">Num 20:28</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">deu 10:8</a></font></span></p>At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to (d) minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, to offer sacrifice, and to declare the Law to the people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009">Deuteronomy 10:9</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For all our sins and transgressions God requires nothing but to turn to him and obey him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015">Deuteronomy 10:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">deu 10:15</a></font></span></p>(g) Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, [even] you above all people, as [it is] this day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Although he was Lord of heaven and earth, he chose no one but you.
