 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001">Genesis 25:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 25:1</a></font></span></p>Then again Abraham (a) took a wife, and her name [was] Keturah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) While Sarah was yet alive.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006">Genesis 25:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">gen 25:6</a></font></span></p>But unto the (b) sons of the (c) concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham (d) gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) For by virtue of God's word he not only had Isaac, but begat many more. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) See (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#024">Gen 22:24</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) To avoid the disputing that otherwise might have come because of the heritage.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#017">Genesis 25:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">gen 25:17</a></font></span></p>And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his (f) people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Who dwelt among the Arabians, and were separate from the blessed seed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018">Genesis 25:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">gen 25:18</a></font></span></p>And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: [and] he died (g) in the presence of all his brethren. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He means that his lot fell to dwell among his brethren as the angel promised.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#022">Genesis 25:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">gen 25:22</a></font></span></p>And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why [am] I (h) thus? And she went (i) to enquire of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, with child, seeing one shall destroy another. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) For that is the only refuge in all our miseries.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#032">Genesis 25:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">gen 25:32</a></font></span></p>And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what (k) profit shall this birthright do to me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The reprobate do not value God's benefits unless they feel them presently, and therefore they prefer present pleasures.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#033">Genesis 25:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">gen 25:33</a></font></span></p>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he (l) sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Thus the wicked prefer their worldly conveniences over God's spiritual graces: but the children of God do the opposite.
