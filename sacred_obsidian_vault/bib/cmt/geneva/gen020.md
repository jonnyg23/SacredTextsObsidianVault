 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001">Genesis 20:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 20:1</a></font></span></p>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and (a) Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which was toward Egypt.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002">Genesis 20:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 20:2</a></font></span></p>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, (b) She [is] my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Abraham had now twice fallen into this sin: such is man's frailty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003">Genesis 20:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">gen 20:3</a></font></span></p>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, (c) thou [art but] a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she [is] a man's wife. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) So greatly God detests the breach of marriage.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#004">Genesis 20:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 20:4</a></font></span></p>But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also (d) a righteous nation? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The infidels confessed that God would not punish but for just occasion: therefore, when he punishes, the occasion is just.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#005">Genesis 20:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 20:5</a></font></span></p>Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my (e) heart and (f) innocency of my hands have I done this. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) As one falling by ignorance, and not doing evil on purpose. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Not thinking to do any man harm.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006">Genesis 20:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">gen 20:6</a></font></span></p>And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also (g) withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God by his holy Spirit restrains those who offend in ignorance, that they not fall into greater offence..  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007">Genesis 20:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">gen 20:7</a></font></span></p>Now therefore restore the man [his] wife; for he [is] a (h) prophet, and he (i) shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore [her] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that [are] thine. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, one to whom God reveals himself familiarly. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) For the prayer of the godly is of force towards God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009">Genesis 20:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 20:9</a></font></span></p>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my (k) kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The wickedness of the king brings God's wrath on the whole realm.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#011">Genesis 20:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 20:11</a></font></span></p>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the (l) fear of God [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) He shows that no honesty can be hoped for, where there is no fear of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012">Genesis 20:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 20:12</a></font></span></p>And yet indeed [she is] my (m) sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) By sister, he means his full cousin, and by daughter Abraham's niece, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029">Gen 11:29</a>) for so the Hebrews use these words.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016">Genesis 20:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 20:16</a></font></span></p>And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to thee a (n) covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: (o) thus she was reproved. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Such a head as with whom you may be preserved from all dangers. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) God caused this heathen king to reprove her because she concealed her identity, seeing that God had given her a husband as her veil and defence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#018">Genesis 20:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">gen 20:18</a></font></span></p>For the LORD (p) had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Had taken away from them the gift of conceiving.
