 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001">Joshua 9:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jos 9:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when all the kings which (a) [were] on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the (b) great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard [thereof]; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) In respect to the plain of Moab. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) The main sea called the Mediterranean.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004">Joshua 9:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jos 9:4</a></font></span></p>They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and (c) bound up; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Because they were all worn.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007">Joshua 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jos 9:7</a></font></span></p>And the men of Israel said unto the (d) Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) For the Gibeonites and the Hivites were all one people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009">Joshua 9:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jos 9:9</a></font></span></p>And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of (e) the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Even the idolaters for fear of death will pretend to honour the true God, and receive his religion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#012">Joshua 9:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jos 9:12</a></font></span></p>This our (f) bread we took hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) The wicked lack no art, nor spare no lies to set forth their policy, when they will deceive the servants of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014">Joshua 9:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jos 9:14</a></font></span></p>And the (g) men took of their victuals, and asked not [counsel] at the mouth of the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Some think that the Israelites are of their victuals, and so made a league with them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017">Joshua 9:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 9:17</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel (h) journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities [were] Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) From Gilgal.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018">Joshua 9:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jos 9:18</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation (l) murmured against the princes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Fearing lest for their sin the plague of God would have come on them all.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#020">Joshua 9:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jos 9:20</a></font></span></p>This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the (k) oath which we sware unto them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) This does not establish rash oaths, but shows God's mercy toward his, who would not punish them for their sin.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023">Joshua 9:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">jos 9:23</a></font></span></p>Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for (l) the house of my God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) For the use of the tabernacle and the temple when it will be built.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#026">Joshua 9:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">jos 9:26</a></font></span></p>And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the (m) hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Who were minded to put them to death for fear of God's wrath.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027">Joshua 9:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">jos 9:27</a></font></span></p>And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the (n) altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, for the service of the temple, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023">Jos 9:23</a>).
