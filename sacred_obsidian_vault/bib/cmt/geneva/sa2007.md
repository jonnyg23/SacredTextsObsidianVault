 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa2 7:2</a></font></span></p>That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within (a) curtains. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Within the tabernacle covered with skins, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007">Exo 26:7</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa2 7:5</a></font></span></p>Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, (b) Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, he should not: yet Nathan speaking according to man's judgment and not by the spirit of prophecy permitted him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#007">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sa2 7:7</a></font></span></p>In all [the places] wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a (c) word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Concerning building a house: meaning without God's express word, nothing should be attempted. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#009">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa2 7:9</a></font></span></p>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a (d) great name, like unto the name of the great [men] that [are] in the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) I have made you famous through all the world. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">sa2 7:10</a></font></span></p>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move (e) no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He promises them quietness, if they will walk in his fear and obedience. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa2 7:14</a></font></span></p>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the (f) rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, gently, as fathers use to chastise their children. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">sa2 7:16</a></font></span></p>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be (g) established for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This was begun in Solomon, as a figure, but accomplished in Christ. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">sa2 7:19</a></font></span></p>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And [is] this the manner of (h) man, O Lord GOD? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Does this not come rather from your free mercy, than from any worthiness that can be in man? 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">sa2 7:23</a></font></span></p>And what one nation in the earth [is] like thy people, [even] like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for (i) you great things and terrible, for (k) thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, [from] the (l) nations and their gods? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) O Israel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) And inheritance, which is Israel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) From the Egyptians and their idols. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#024">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa2 7:24</a></font></span></p>For thou hast (m) confirmed to thyself thy people Israel [to be] a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) He shows that God's free election is the only reason why the Israelites were chosen to be his people. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#026">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">sa2 7:26</a></font></span></p>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God over Israel: and let the (n) house of thy servant David be established before thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) This prayer is most effective when we chiefly seek God's glory, and the accomplishment of his promise. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#029">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">sa2 7:29</a></font></span></p>Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast (o) spoken [it]: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Therefore I firmly believe it will come to pass.
