 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which contains part of April and part of May.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Or the court where the people prayed which was before the place where the altar of burnt offerings stood.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg1 6:5</a></font></span></p>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of the temple and of (d) the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) When God spoke between the Cherubim, called also the most holy place. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006">3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg1 6:6</a></font></span></p>The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed (e) rests round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Which were certain stones coming out of the wall, as stays for the beams to rest upon.

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) For when he spoke of the house in the first verse, he meant both the oracle and the temple.
