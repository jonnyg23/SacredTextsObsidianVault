 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 46:7</a></font></span></p>And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs (b) according as his hand shall be able, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning, as he will think good.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was at the Jubile, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009">Lev 25:9</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) But be content with that portion that God has assigned him, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008">Eze 45:8</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That the people should not have to do with those things which belong to the Lord, and think it lawful for them to eat them.
