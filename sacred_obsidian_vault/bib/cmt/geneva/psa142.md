 <p>
 </p><p>(a) David's patience and constant prayer to God condemns their wicked rage, who in their troubles either despair and murmur against God, or else seek other than God, to have relief in their miseries.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 142:5</a></font></span></p>I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou [art] my (b) refuge [and] my portion in the land of the living. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Though all means failed him, yet he knew that God would never forsake him.
