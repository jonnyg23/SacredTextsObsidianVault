 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because you rejoiced when the enemy destroyed my city and temple.

 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, to the Babylonians. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) They will chase you away, and take your gorgeous houses to dwell in.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Called also Philadelphin, which was the chief city of the Ammonites and full of conveniences, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027">Sa2 12:27</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) So that no power or strength should be able to resist the Babylonians.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which were certain garrisons of Philistines by which they often molested the Jews, of the Cherethims David also had a guard, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018">Sa2 8:18</a>).
