 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 16:1</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, (a) seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Signifying that we should not show ourselves more pitiful than God, nor to lament those whom he casts out. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 16:2</a></font></span></p>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear [it], he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come (b) to sacrifice to the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, to make a peace offering, which may be done even though the ark was not there. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 16:4</a></font></span></p>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town (c) trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Afraid, lest some grievous crime had been committed, because the prophet was not wont to come there. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 16:6</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S (d) anointed [is] before him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Thinking that Eliab had been appointed by God to be made king. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa1 16:14</a></font></span></p>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an (e) evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) The wicked spirits are at God's commandment to execute his will against the wicked. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#018">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa1 16:18</a></font></span></p>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a (f) son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, [that is] cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD [is] with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Though David was now anointed king by the prophet, yet God would strengthen and test him in various ways before he had the use of his kingdom. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">sa1 16:23</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was (g) refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) God would have Saul receive this benefit from David's hand, that his condemnation might be even more evident, for his cruel hate toward him.
