 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001">Zechariah 12:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 12:1</a></font></span></p>The burden of the word of the LORD for (a) Israel, saith the LORD, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, the ten tribes, which neglected God's benefit in delivering their brethren, and had rather remain in captivity, than to return home when God called them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002">Zechariah 12:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">zac 12:2</a></font></span></p>Behold, I will make Jerusalem a (b) cup of trembling to all the people around, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah [and] against Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Jerusalem will be defended against all her enemies: so will God defend all Judah also, and will destroy the enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005">Zechariah 12:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 12:5</a></font></span></p>And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The (c) inhabitants of Jerusalem [shall be] my strength in the LORD of hosts their God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Every captain, that had many under him before, will now think that the small power of Jerusalem will be sufficient to defend them against all enemies, because the Lord is among them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007">Zechariah 12:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 12:7</a></font></span></p>The LORD also shall save the (d) tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not magnify [themselves] against Judah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The people who are now as it were dispersed by the fields, and lie open to their enemies, will be preserved by my power just as if they were under their kings (which is meant by the house of David), or in their defended cities.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010">Zechariah 12:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zac 12:10</a></font></span></p>And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of (e) grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have (f) pierced, and they shall mourn for (g) him, as one mourneth for [his] only [son], and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for [his] firstborn. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) They will have the feeling of my grace by faith, and know that I have compassion on them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, whom they have continually vexed with their obstinacy, and grieved my Spirit. In (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037">Joh 19:37</a>) it is referred to Christ's body, whereas here it is referred to the Spirit of God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) They will turn to God by true repentance, whom before they had so grievously offended by their ingratitude.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011">Zechariah 12:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">zac 12:11</a></font></span></p>In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the (h) mourning of (i) Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) They will exceedingly lament and repent for their offences against God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Which was the name of a town and place near to Megiddo, where Josiah was slain; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022">Ch2 35:22</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012">Zechariah 12:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">zac 12:12</a></font></span></p>And the (k) land shall mourn, every family (l) apart; the family of the (m) house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, in all places where the Jews will remain. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) Signifying, that this mourning or repentance would not be a vain ceremony: but every one touched with his own griefs will lament. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) Under these certain families he includes all the tribes, and shows that both the kings and the priests had by their sins pierced Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#013">Zechariah 12:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">zac 12:13</a></font></span></p>The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of (n) Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Also called Simeon.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#014">Zechariah 12:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">zac 12:14</a></font></span></p>All the families that (o) remain, every family apart, and their wives apart. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, who were elect by grace, and preserved from the common destruction.
