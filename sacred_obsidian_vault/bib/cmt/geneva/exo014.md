 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002">Exodus 14:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">exo 14:2</a></font></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they (a) turn and encamp before (b) Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) From toward the country of the Philistines. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) So the Sea was before them, mountains on either side, and the enemies at their back: yet they obeyed God, and were delivered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#004">Exodus 14:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">exo 14:4</a></font></span></p>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will (c) be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I [am] the LORD. And they did so. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) By punishing his obstinate rebellion.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007">Exodus 14:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">exo 14:7</a></font></span></p>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and (d) all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Josephus writes that besides those chariots, there were 50,000 horsemen, and 80,000 footmen.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008">Exodus 14:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">exo 14:8</a></font></span></p>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an (e) high hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) With great joy and boldness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010">Exodus 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">exo 14:10</a></font></span></p>And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore (f) afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) They who earlier had rejoiced in their deliverance, being now in danger, are afraid.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#012">Exodus 14:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">exo 14:12</a></font></span></p>[Is] not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let (g) us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Such is the impatience of the flesh, that it cannot wait for God's appointed time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014">Exodus 14:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">exo 14:14</a></font></span></p>The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall (h) hold your peace. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Only put your trust in God without grudging or doubting.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015">Exodus 14:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">exo 14:15</a></font></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore (i) criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Thus in temptation faith fights against the flesh, and cries with inward groanings to the Lord.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020">Exodus 14:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">exo 14:20</a></font></span></p>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them], but it gave (k) light by night [to these]: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The cloud gave light to the Israelites, but to the Egyptians it was darkness, so that their two groups could not join together.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024">Exodus 14:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">exo 14:24</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, that in the morning (l) watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which was about the last three hours of the night.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027">Exodus 14:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">exo 14:27</a></font></span></p>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD (m) overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) So, using the water, the Lord saved his own and drowned his enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031">Exodus 14:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">exo 14:31</a></font></span></p>And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his (n) servant Moses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, the doctrine which he taught them in the Name of the Lord.
