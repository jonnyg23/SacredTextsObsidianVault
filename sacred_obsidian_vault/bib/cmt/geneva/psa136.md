 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001">Psalms 136:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 136:1</a></font></span></p>O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: for his (a) mercy [endureth] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) By this repetition he shows that the least of God's benefits bind us to thanksgiving: but chiefly his mercy, which is principally declared towards his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006">Psalms 136:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 136:6</a></font></span></p>To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his (b) mercy [endureth] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) This was a common kind of thanksgiving, which the whole people used, when they had received any benefit from God, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006">Ch2 7:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021">Ch2 20:21</a>), meaning that God was not only merciful to their fathers, but also continued the same to their posterity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#011">Psalms 136:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 136:11</a></font></span></p>And (c) brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy [endureth] for ever: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) God's merciful providence toward man appears in all his creatures, but chiefly in that he delivered his Church from the clutches of their enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#012">Psalms 136:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 136:12</a></font></span></p>With a strong hand, and with a (d) stretched out arm: for his mercy [endureth] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) In doing such a work as was never done before, nor that any other could do.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#016">Psalms 136:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 136:16</a></font></span></p>To him which led his people through the (e) wilderness: for his mercy [endureth] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Where for the space of forty years he showed infinite and most strange wonders.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#018">Psalms 136:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 136:18</a></font></span></p>And slew (f) famous kings: for his mercy [endureth] for ever: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Declaring by it that no power or authority was so dear to him as the love of his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023">Psalms 136:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">psa 136:23</a></font></span></p>Who remembered us in our (g) low estate: for his mercy [endureth] for ever: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) In our greatest affliction and slavery when we looked for nothing less than to have had any help.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025">Psalms 136:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">psa 136:25</a></font></span></p>Who giveth food to all (h) flesh: for his mercy [endureth] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Seeing that God provides even for the beasts much more has he care over his.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#026">Psalms 136:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">psa 136:26</a></font></span></p>(i) O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy [endureth] for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Seeing that all ages have had most plain testimonies of God's benefits.
