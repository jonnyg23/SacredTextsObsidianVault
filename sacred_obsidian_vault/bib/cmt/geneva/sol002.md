 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sol 2:2</a></font></span></p>As the lily among thorns, so [is] my (a) love among the daughters. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Thus Christ prefers his Church above all other things.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sol 2:3</a></font></span></p>(b) As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so [is] my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The spouse testifies her great desire toward her husband, but her strength fails her, and therefore she desires to be comforted, and felt it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sol 2:7</a></font></span></p>(c) I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not, nor awake [my] love, till he please. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Christ charges them who have to do in the Church as it were by a solemn oath, that they trouble not the quietness of it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sol 2:8</a></font></span></p>(d) The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) This is spoken of Christ who took on our nature to come to help his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sol 2:9</a></font></span></p>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he (e) standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, gazing himself through the (f) lattice. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For as his divinity was hidden under the cloak of our flesh. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) So that we cannot have full knowledge of him in this life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sol 2:11</a></font></span></p>For, lo, the (g) winter is past, the rain is over [and] gone; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, sin and error is driven back by the coming of Christ, who is here described by the springtime, when all things flourish.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sol 2:14</a></font></span></p>O my dove, [that art] in the (h) clefts of the rock, in the secret [places] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet [is] thy voice, and thy countenance [is] comely. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) You who are ashamed of your sins, come and show yourself to me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">sol 2:15</a></font></span></p>Take for us the foxes, the (i) little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines [have] tender grapes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Suppress the heretics while they are young, that is, when they begin to show their malice, and destroy the vine of the Lord.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sol 2:17</a></font></span></p>Until the day shall break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a (k) roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The church desires Christ to be most ready to help her in all dangers.
