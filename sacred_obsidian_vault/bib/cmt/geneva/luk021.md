 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001">Luke 21:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">luk 21:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) According to the judgment of God, the poor may even exceed the rich in generosity and liberality.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005">Luke 21:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">luk 21:5</a></font></span></p>(2) And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and (a) gifts, he said, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The destruction of the temple is foretold so that the true spiritual building may be built, whose chief builders must and ought to be cautious. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) These were things that were hung up on walls and pillars.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008">Luke 21:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">luk 21:8</a></font></span></p>And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come (b) in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Using my name.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009">Luke 21:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">luk 21:9</a></font></span></p>(3) But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end [is] not by and by. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The true temple of God is built up even in the midst of incredible tumults and most severe miseries, and this through invincible patience, so that the end result can be nothing else but most happy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#013">Luke 21:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">luk 21:13</a></font></span></p>And it shall turn to you for (c) a testimony. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This will be the result of your troubles and afflictions: they will be witnesses both before God and man of the treacherous and cruel dealing of your enemies, as well as of your steadfastness: A noble saying, that the afflictions of the godly and holy men pertain to the witness of the truth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019">Luke 21:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">luk 21:19</a></font></span></p>In your patience (d) possess ye your souls. 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The final destruction of the whole city is foretold.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#023">Luke 21:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">luk 21:23</a></font></span></p>But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and (e) wrath upon this people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By "wrath" are meant those things which God sends when he is displeased.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">luk 21:24</a></font></span></p>And they shall fall by the (f) edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Literally, "mouth", for the Hebrews call the edge of a sword the mouth because the edge of the sword bites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025">Luke 21:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">luk 21:25</a></font></span></p>(g) And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) When the times have expired which are appointed for the salvation of the Gentiles and the punishment of the Jews: And so he changes topics from the destruction of Jerusalem to the history of the latter judgment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026">Luke 21:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">luk 21:26</a></font></span></p>(5) Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) After various severe trials the Lord will at last plainly appear to deliver his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#029">Luke 21:29</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">luk 21:36</a></font></span></p>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to (i) stand before the Son of man. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) You will appear before him in a condition such that you will abide the presence and sentence of the Judge without fear.
