 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 18:2</a></font></span></p>(a) The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He uses this diversity of names to show that as the wicked have many means to hurt, so God has many ways to help.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003">Psalms 18:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 18:3</a></font></span></p>I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be (b) praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) A description of the wrath of God against his enemies, after he had heard his prayer.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008">Psalms 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 18:8</a></font></span></p>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and (e) fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 18:10</a></font></span></p>And he rode upon a (g) cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 18:11</a></font></span></p>He made darkness his (h) secret place; his pavilion round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) As a king angry with the people, will not show himself to them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013">Psalms 18:13</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Thunders, lightnings and hail.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014">Psalms 18:14</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, the deep bottoms were seen when the Red sea was divided.

 <p>
 </p><p>(n) That is, Saul. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(o) Therefore God sent me help.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019">Psalms 18:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 18:19</a></font></span></p>He brought me forth also into a large place; (p) he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) The cause of God's deliverance is his favour and love for us.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020">Psalms 18:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">psa 18:20</a></font></span></p>The LORD rewarded me according to my (q) righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) David was sure of his righteous cause and good behaviour toward Saul and his enemies and therefore was assured of God's favour and deliverance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022">Psalms 18:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">psa 18:22</a></font></span></p>For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his (r) statutes from me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) For all his dangers he exercised himself in the law of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023">Psalms 18:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">psa 18:23</a></font></span></p>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine (f) iniquity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) I neither gave place to their wicked temptations nor to my own desires.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025">Psalms 18:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">psa 18:25</a></font></span></p>With the (t) merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) Here he speaks of God according to our capacity, who shows mercy to his and punishes the wicked, as is also said in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021">Lev 26:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024">Lev 26:24</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027">Psalms 18:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">psa 18:27</a></font></span></p>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt (u) bring down high looks. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) When their sin is come to the full measure.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029">Psalms 18:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">psa 18:29</a></font></span></p>For by thee I have (x) run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">psa 18:30</a></font></span></p>[As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the (y) word of the LORD is tried: he [is] a buckler to all those that trust in him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) No matter how great or many the dangers may be, yet God's promise must take effect.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032">Psalms 18:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">psa 18:32</a></font></span></p>[It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my (z) way perfect.

 <p>
 </p><p>(a) As towers and forts, which he took out of the hands of God's enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035">Psalms 18:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">psa 18:35</a></font></span></p>Thou hast also given me the (b) shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy (c) gentleness hath made me great.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">psa 18:37</a></font></span></p>(d) I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) David declares that he did nothing besides his calling, but was stirred up by God's Spirit to execute his judgments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040">Psalms 18:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">psa 18:40</a></font></span></p>Thou hast also (e) given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) They who reject the cry of the afflicted, God will also reject them when they cry for help, for either pain or fear causes those hypocrites to cry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043">Psalms 18:43</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_043">psa 18:43</a></font></span></p>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the (g) heathen: a people [whom] I have not (h) known shall serve me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Who dwell round about me. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) The kingdom of Christ is prefigured in David's kingdom, who by the preaching of his word brings all to his subjection.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044">Psalms 18:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">psa 18:44</a></font></span></p>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall (i) submit themselves unto me.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">psa 18:45</a></font></span></p>The strangers shall (k) fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Fear will cause them to be afraid and come forth from their secret holes and holds to seek pardon.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048">Psalms 18:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">psa 18:48</a></font></span></p>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the (l) violent man. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, Saul who out of malice persecuted him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049">Psalms 18:49</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">psa 18:49</a></font></span></p>Therefore will (m) I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
