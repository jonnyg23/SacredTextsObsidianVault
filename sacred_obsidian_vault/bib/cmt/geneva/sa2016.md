 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which was the hill of olives, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030">Sa2 15:30</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa2 16:2</a></font></span></p>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The (b) asses [be] for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Commonly there are no viler traitors than they, who under the pretence of friendship accuse others.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa2 16:5</a></font></span></p>And when king David came to (c) Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name [was] Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was a city in the tribe of Benjamin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:6</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa2 16:8</a></font></span></p>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the (e) blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, because thou [art] a bloody man. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Reproaching him, as though by his means Ishbosheth and Abner were slain.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) David felt that this was the judgment of God for his sin, and therefore humbles himself to his rod. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">sa2 16:12</a></font></span></p>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will (g) requite me good for his cursing this day.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa2 16:14</a></font></span></p>And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves (h) there. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, at Bahurim. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">sa2 16:17</a></font></span></p>And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy (i) friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">sa2 16:21</a></font></span></p>And (k) Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that [are] with thee be strong. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Suspecting the change of the kingdom, and so his own overthrow, he gives such counsel as might most hinder his father's reconciliation: and also declare to the people that Absalom was in highest authority. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">sa2 16:23</a></font></span></p>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man had (l) enquired at the oracle of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) It was so esteemed for the success of it.
