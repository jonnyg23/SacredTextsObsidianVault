 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">exo 24:3</a></font></span></p>(b) And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When he had received these laws in mount Sinai.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005">Exodus 24:5</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">exo 24:8</a></font></span></p>And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, Behold the (d) blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">exo 24:10</a></font></span></p>And they (e) saw the God of Israel: and [there was] under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in [his] clearness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) As perfectly as their infirmities could behold his majesty.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011">Exodus 24:11</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He did not make them afraid, nor punish them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, rejoiced.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The second time. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Signifying the hardness of our hearts, unless God writes his laws in it by his Spirit, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jer 31:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019">Eze 11:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003">Co2 3:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010">Heb 8:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016">Heb 10:16</a>)

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">exo 24:17</a></font></span></p>And the sight of the glory of the LORD [was] like (l) devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The Lord appears like devouring fire to carnal men: but to them that he draws with his Spirit, he is like pleasant sapphire.
