 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 33:5</a></font></span></p>They come to (d) fight with the Chaldeans, but [it is] to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my (e) face from this city. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The Jews think to overcome the Chaldeans, but they seek their own destruction. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) He shows that God's favour is cause of all prosperity, as his anger is of all adversity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006">Jeremiah 33:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 33:6</a></font></span></p>Behold, I (f) will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 33:9</a></font></span></p>And it shall be to me a name of (h) joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) By which he shows that the Church in which is remission of sins, is God's honour and glory, so that whoever is enemy to it, labours to dishonour God.

 <p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, Christ that will call his Church. 
 </p><p>
