 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001">Genesis 10:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 10:1</a></font></span></p>(a) Now these [are] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) These generations are here recited, partly to declare the marvellous increase, and also to set forth their great forgetfulness of God's grace towards their fathers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002">Genesis 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 10:2</a></font></span></p>The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and (b) Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Of Madai and Javan came the Medes and Greeks.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005">Genesis 10:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 10:5</a></font></span></p>By these were the (c) isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) So do the Jews call all countries which are separated from them by sea, as Greece, Italy etc, which were given to the children of Japheth, of whom came the Gentiles.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006">Genesis 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">gen 10:6</a></font></span></p>And the sons of Ham; (d) Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Of Cush and Mizraim came the Ethiopians and Egyptians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008">Genesis 10:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">gen 10:8</a></font></span></p>And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a (e) mighty one in the earth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning, a cruel oppressor and tyrant.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009">Genesis 10:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 10:9</a></font></span></p>He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even (f) as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) His tyranny came into a proverb as hated both by God and man: for he did not cease to commit cruelty even in God's presence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010">Genesis 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">gen 10:10</a></font></span></p>And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of (g) Shinar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For there was another city in Egypt, called Babel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013">Genesis 10:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 10:13</a></font></span></p>And Mizraim begat (h) Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Of Lud came the Lydians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021">Genesis 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">gen 10:21</a></font></span></p>Unto (i) Shem also, the father of all the children of (k) Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were [children] born. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) In his stock the Church was preserved: therefore Moses stops speaking of Japheth and Ham, and speaks of Shem extensively. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) Of whom came the Hebrews or Jews.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025">Genesis 10:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">gen 10:25</a></font></span></p>And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one [was] Peleg; for in his days was the earth (l) divided; and his brother's name [was] Joktan. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) This division came by the diversity of language, as appears in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009">Gen 11:9</a>).
