 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001">Genesis 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 16:1</a></font></span></p>Now (a) Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name [was] Hagar. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) It seems that she had respect for God's promise, which could not be accomplished without issue.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002">Genesis 16:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 16:2</a></font></span></p>And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath (b) restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) She fails by limiting God's power to the common order of nature, as though God could not give her children in her old age.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#004">Genesis 16:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 16:4</a></font></span></p>And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was (c) despised in her eyes. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) This punishment declares what they gain if they attempt any thing against the word of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007">Genesis 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">gen 16:7</a></font></span></p>And the (d) angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Which was Christ, as appears in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013">Gen 16:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017">Gen 18:17</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#009">Genesis 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 16:9</a></font></span></p>And the angel of the LORD said unto her, (e) Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) God rejects no estate of people in their misery, but sends them comfort.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012">Genesis 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 16:12</a></font></span></p>And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man's hand against him; and (f) he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, the Ishmaelites will be a separate people by themselves and not part of another people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013">Genesis 16:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 16:13</a></font></span></p>And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, (g) Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) She rebukes her own dullness and acknowledges God's graces, who was present with her everywhere.
