 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001">Proverbs 28:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 28:1</a></font></span></p>The wicked (a) flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because their own conscience accuses them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#002">Proverbs 28:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 28:2</a></font></span></p>For the transgression of a land (b) many [are] its princes: but by a man of understanding [and] knowledge [its] state shall be prolonged. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The state of the commonwealth is often changed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008">Proverbs 28:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pro 28:8</a></font></span></p>He that by interest and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather (c) it for him that will pity the poor.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Because it is not of faith which is grounded on God's word or law which the wicked contemn.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#011">Proverbs 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">pro 28:11</a></font></span></p>The rich man [is] wise in his own conceit; but the poor man that hath understanding searcheth (e) him out.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">pro 28:14</a></font></span></p>Happy [is] the man that (g) feareth always: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Which stands in awe of God, and is afraid to offend him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015">Proverbs 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pro 28:15</a></font></span></p>[As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; [so is] (h) a wicked ruler over the poor people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) For he can never be satisfied but always oppresses and spoils.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017">Proverbs 28:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pro 28:17</a></font></span></p>A man that doeth violence to the blood of [any] person shall flee to the pit; let no man (i) sustain him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) No one will be able to deliver him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021">Proverbs 28:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 28:21</a></font></span></p>To have respect of persons [is] not good: for for a piece of (k) bread [that] man will transgress. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He will be abused for nothing.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022">Proverbs 28:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pro 28:22</a></font></span></p>He that hasteneth to be rich [hath] an evil (l) eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Meaning, he that is covetous.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025">Proverbs 28:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">pro 28:25</a></font></span></p>He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made (m) fat.
