 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001">Psalms 140:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 140:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the (a) violent man; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who persecutes me out of malice and without cause.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002">Psalms 140:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 140:2</a></font></span></p>Which imagine mischiefs in [their] (b) heart; continually are they gathered together [for] war. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, by their false accusations and lies, they kindle the hatred of the wicked against me.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003">Psalms 140:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 140:3</a></font></span></p>They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; (c) adders' poison [is] under their lips. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He shows the weapons the wicked use, when power and force fail them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004">Psalms 140:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 140:4</a></font></span></p>Keep (d) me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He declares the remedy of the godly, when they are oppressed by the worldlings.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007">Psalms 140:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 140:7</a></font></span></p>O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou (e) hast covered my head in the day of battle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He calls to God with lively faith, being assured of his mercies, because he had before time proved, that God helped him ever in his dangers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008">Psalms 140:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 140:8</a></font></span></p>Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: (f) further not his wicked device; [lest] they exalt themselves. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) For it is in God's hand to overthrow the counsels and enterprises of the wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009">Psalms 140:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 140:9</a></font></span></p>[As for] (g) the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) It seems that he alludes to Saul.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010">Psalms 140:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 140:10</a></font></span></p>Let burning coals fall upon them: (h) let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is by God, for David saw that they were reprobate and that there was no hope of repentance in them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011">Psalms 140:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 140:11</a></font></span></p>Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall (i) hunt the violent man to overthrow [him]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) God's plagues will light on him in such sort, that he will not escape.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013">Psalms 140:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 140:13</a></font></span></p>Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall (k) dwell in thy presence. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, will be descended and preserved by your fatherly providence and care.
