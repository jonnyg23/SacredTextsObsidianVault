 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 14:2</a></font></span></p>And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for (c) servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Signifying that the Jews would be superior to the Gentiles and that they would be brought under the service of Christ by the preaching of the Apostles, by which all are brought to the subjection of Christ, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005">Co2 10:5</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006">Isaiah 14:6</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning that where tyrants reign, there can be no rest or quietness and also how detestable a thing tyranny is, seeing the insensible creatures have opportunity to rejoice at their destruction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009">Isaiah 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 14:9</a></font></span></p>Hell from beneath is moved for thee to (f) meet [thee] at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, [even] all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) As though they feared, lest you should trouble the dead, as you did the living and here he derides the proud tyranny of the wicked, who know not that all creatures wish their destruction, that they may rejoice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011">Isaiah 14:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 14:11</a></font></span></p>Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, [and] the noise of thy viols: the worm (g) is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) You who thought yourself most glorious and as it were placed in the heaven for the morning star that goes before the sun, is called Lucifer, to whom Nebuchadnezzar is compared.
