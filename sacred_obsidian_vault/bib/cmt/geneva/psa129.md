 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 129:1</a></font></span></p>"A Song of degrees." Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may (a) Israel now say: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) The Church now afflicted should remember how her condition has always been such from the beginning to be molested most grievously by the wicked, yet in time it has always been delivered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004">Psalms 129:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 129:4</a></font></span></p>The LORD [is] (b) righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Because God is righteous, he cannot but plague his adversary, and deliver his as oxen out of the plough.

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The enemies who lift themselves high, and as it were approach the Sun, are consumed with the heat of God's wrath, because they are not grounded in godly humility.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, the wicked will perish, and none will pass for them.
