 <p>
 </p><p>(a) There were three types of tents: of the Lord, of the Levites, and of the Israelites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#006">Numbers 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">num 5:6</a></font></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin (b) that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Commit any fault willingly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008">Numbers 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">num 5:8</a></font></span></p>But if the (c) man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, [even] to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) If he is dead to whom the wrong is done and also has no relatives.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#009">Numbers 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 5:9</a></font></span></p>And every offering of all the (d) holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Or, things offered to the Lord, as first fruits, etc.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 5:12</a></font></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife (e) go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By breaking the band of marriage, and playing the harlot.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">num 5:15</a></font></span></p>Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth [part] of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no (f) oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it [is] an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to (g) remembrance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Only in the sin offering, and so this offering of jealousy were neither oil nor incense offered. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) Or, making the sin known, and not purging it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#017">Numbers 5:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">num 5:17</a></font></span></p>And the priest shall take (h) holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put [it] into the water: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Which also is called the water of purification of sprinkling, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009">Num 19:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018">Numbers 5:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">num 5:18</a></font></span></p>And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which [is] the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the (i) curse: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) It was so called by the effect, because it declared the woman to be accursed, and turned to her destruction.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021">Numbers 5:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">num 5:21</a></font></span></p>Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a (k) curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Both because she had committed so heinous a fault, and forswore herself in denying the same.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#022">Numbers 5:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">num 5:22</a></font></span></p>And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make [thy] belly to swell, and [thy] thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, (l) Amen, amen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, may it be as you wished, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013">Psa 41:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015">Deu 27:15</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">num 5:23</a></font></span></p>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall (m) blot [them] out with the bitter water: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Shall wash the curses, which are written, into the water in the vessel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#026">Numbers 5:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">num 5:26</a></font></span></p>And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, [even] the memorial thereof, and burn [it] upon the (n) altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Where the incense was offered.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#031">Numbers 5:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">num 5:31</a></font></span></p>Then shall the man be (o) guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) The man might accuse his wife on suspicion and not be reproved.
