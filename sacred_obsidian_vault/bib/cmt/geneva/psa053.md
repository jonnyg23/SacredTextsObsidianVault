The fool hath said in his heart, [There is] (b) no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: [there is] none that doeth good. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Which was an instrument or king of note. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Whereas no regard is had for honesty or dishonesty, for virtue nor for vice, there the prophet pronounces that the people have no God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002">Psalms 53:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 53:2</a></font></span></p>God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were [any] that did understand, that did (c) seek God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) By which he condemns all knowledge and understanding that tends not to seek God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004">Psalms 53:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 53:4</a></font></span></p>Have the (d) workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people [as] they eat bread: they have not called upon God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) David pronounces God's vengeance against cruel governors who having charge to defend and preserve God's people, cruelly devour them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005">Psalms 53:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 53:5</a></font></span></p>There were they in great fear, [where] no (e) fear was: for God hath scattered the (f) bones of him that encampeth [against] thee: thou hast put [them] to shame, because God hath despised them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) When they thought there was no opportunity to fear, the sudden vengeance of God lighted on them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) No matter how great the enemies power is, or fearful the danger, yet God delivers his in due time.
