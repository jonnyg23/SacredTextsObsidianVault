 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, a harlot who gives herself to someone other than her husband. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) By oil and honey he means flattering and crafty enticements.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005">Proverbs 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">pro 5:5</a></font></span></p>Her (c) feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">pro 5:9</a></font></span></p>Lest thou give thine (e) honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, your strength and goods to her who will have no pity on you as is read of Samson and the prodigal son.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010">Proverbs 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 5:10</a></font></span></p>Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy (f) labours [be] in the house of a stranger;

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Although I was faithfully instructed in the truth, yet I almost fell to utter shame and destruction nonetheless, by good bringing up in the assembly of the godly.

 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He teaches us sobriety exhorting us to live of our own labours and to be beneficial to the godly who want.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017">Proverbs 5:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pro 5:17</a></font></span></p>Let them be only (i) thine own, and not strangers' with thee. 
 <p>

 </p><p>(k) Your children who will come from you in great abundance showing that God blesses marriage and curses whoredom. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(l) Who you married in your youth.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 5:21</a></font></span></p>For the ways of man [are] before the (m) eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) He declares that unless a man joins to his wife both in heart and in outward conversation, he will not escape the judgments of God.
