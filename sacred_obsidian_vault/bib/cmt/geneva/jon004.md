 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001">Jonah 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jon 4:1</a></font></span></p>But it displeased (a) Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because by this he would be taken as a false prophet, and so the name of God, which he preached, would be blasphemed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002">Jonah 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jon 4:2</a></font></span></p>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, [was] not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto (b) Tarshish: for I knew that thou [art] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003">Jon 1:3</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003">Jonah 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jon 4:3</a></font></span></p>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life (c) from me; for [it is] better for me to die than to live. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Thus he prayed from grief, fearing that God's name by this forgiveness might be blasphemed, as though he sent his Prophets forth to make known his judgments in vain.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004">Jonah 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jon 4:4</a></font></span></p>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be (d) angry? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Will you judge when I do things for my glory, and when I do not?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005">Jonah 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jon 4:5</a></font></span></p>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, (e) till he might see what would become of the city. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For he doubted as yet whether God would show them mercy or not, and therefore after forty days he departed out of the city, to see what God would do.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006">Jonah 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jon 4:6</a></font></span></p>And the LORD God prepared a (f) gourd, and made [it] to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which was a further means to cover him from the heat of the sun, as he remained in his booth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009">Jonah 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jon 4:9</a></font></span></p>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be (g) angry, [even] unto death. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) This declares the great inconveniences into which God's servants fall when they give place to their own affections, and do not in all things willingly submit themselves to God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011">Jonah 4:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jon 4:11</a></font></span></p>And should (h) not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that (i) cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and [also] much cattle? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Thus God mercifully reproves him who would pity himself and this gourd, and yet would keep God from showing his compassion to so many thousand people. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) Meaning that they were children and infants.
