 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#002">Job 26:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 26:2</a></font></span></p>(a) How hast thou helped [him that is] without power? [how] (b) savest thou the arm [that hath] no strength? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) You concluded nothing, for neither did you help me while destitute of all help, nor yet speak sufficiently on God's behalf, who has no need for your defence. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) But you do not apply it to the purpose.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004">Job 26:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 26:4</a></font></span></p>To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit (c) came from thee? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, moves you to speak this?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005">Job 26:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 26:5</a></font></span></p>(d) Dead [things] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Job begins to declare the force of God's power and providence in the mines and metals in the deep places of the earth.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006">Job 26:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 26:6</a></font></span></p>Hell [is] (e) naked before him, and (f) destruction hath no covering. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) There is nothing hidden in the bottom of the earth but he sees it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning, the grave in which things putrify.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007">Job 26:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 26:7</a></font></span></p>He stretcheth out the (g) north over the empty place, [and] hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He causes the whole earth to turn about the North pole.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010">Job 26:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 26:10</a></font></span></p>He hath (h) compassed the waters with bounds, until the (i) day and night come to an end. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, he hid the heavens which are called his throne. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) So long as this world endures.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011">Job 26:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 26:11</a></font></span></p>The (k) pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Not that heaven has pillars to uphold it, but he speaks by a similitude as though he would say heaven itself is not able to abide his reproach.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013">Job 26:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 26:13</a></font></span></p>By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked (l) serpent. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Which is a figure of stars shaped like a serpent, because of the crookedness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014">Job 26:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 26:14</a></font></span></p>Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but (m) how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) If these few things which we see daily with our eyes, declare his great power and providence, how much more would they appear, if we were to comprehend all his works.
