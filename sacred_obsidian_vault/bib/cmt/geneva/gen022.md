 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002">Genesis 22:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 22:2</a></font></span></p>And he said, Take now thy son, thine only [son] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of (a) Moriah; and (b) offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Signifying the fear of God, in which place he was also honoured, Solomon later building the temple there. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) This was the main point of his temptation, seeing that he was commanded to offer up him in whom God had promised to bless all the nations of the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005">Genesis 22:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 22:5</a></font></span></p>And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and (e) come again to you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He did not doubt that God would accomplish his promise, even if he should sacrifice his son.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008">Genesis 22:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">gen 22:8</a></font></span></p>And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a (d) burnt offering: so they went both of them together. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) The only way to overcome all temptation is to rest on God's providence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009">Genesis 22:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 22:9</a></font></span></p>And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and (e) bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For it is likely that his father had told him God's commandment, to which he showed himself obedient.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012">Genesis 22:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 22:12</a></font></span></p>And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I (f) know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son] from me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, by your true obedience you have declared your living faith.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014">Genesis 22:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 22:14</a></font></span></p>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said [to] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall (g) be seen. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The name is changed to show that God both sees and provides secretly for his and also evidently is seen, and felt in the right time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016">Genesis 22:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 22:16</a></font></span></p>And said, By (h) myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son]: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Signifying, that there is none greater then he.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#024">Genesis 22:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">gen 22:24</a></font></span></p>And his (i) concubine, whose name [was] Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Concubine is often used to refer to those women who were inferior to the wives.
