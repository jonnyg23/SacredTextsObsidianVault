 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Some think that Reuel, Jethro, Hobab, and Keni were all one: Kimhi says that Reuel was Jethro's father: so Hobab was Moses father-in-law, see (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018">Exo 2:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001">Exo 3:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018">Exo 4:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001">Exo 18:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</a>)
