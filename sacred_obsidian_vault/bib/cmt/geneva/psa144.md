 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001">Psalms 144:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 144:1</a></font></span></p>"[A Psalm] of David." Blessed [be] the LORD my strength, which (a) teacheth my hands to war, [and] my fingers to fight: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Who out of a poor shepherd has made a valiant warrior and mighty conqueror.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002">Psalms 144:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 144:2</a></font></span></p>My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and [he] in whom I trust; who (b) subdueth my people under me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He confesses that neither by his own authority, power or policy was his kingdom quiet, but by the secret grace of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003">Psalms 144:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 144:3</a></font></span></p>LORD, what [is] man, that thou (c) takest knowledge of him! [or] the son of man, that thou makest account of him! 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) To give to God just praise, is to confess ourselves to be unworthy of so excellent benefits, and that he bestows them on us of his free mercy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005">Psalms 144:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 144:5</a></font></span></p>(d) Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He desires God to continue his graces, and to send help for the present need.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006">Psalms 144:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 144:6</a></font></span></p>(e) Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By these manner of speeches he shows that all the hindrances in the world cannot prevent God's power, which he apprehends by faith.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007">Psalms 144:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 144:7</a></font></span></p>Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great (f) waters, from the hand of strange children; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, deliver me from the tumults of they who should be my people but are corrupt in their judgment and enterprises, as though they were strangers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008">Psalms 144:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 144:8</a></font></span></p>Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand (g) of falsehood. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For though they shake hands, they do not keep their promises.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009">Psalms 144:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 144:9</a></font></span></p>I will sing a (h) new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery [and] an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) That is, a rare and excellent song, as your great benefits deserve.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010">Psalms 144:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 144:10</a></font></span></p>[It is he] that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his (i) servant from the hurtful sword. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Though wicked kings are called God's servants, as was Cyrus in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isa 45:1</a>), for he uses them to execute his judgments: yet David because of God's promise and they who rule godly are properly so called, because they do not serve their own affections, but set forth God's glory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012">Psalms 144:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 144:12</a></font></span></p>(k) That our sons [may be] as plants grown up in their youth; [that] our daughters [may be] as corner stones, polished [after] the similitude of a palace: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) He desires God to continue his benefits toward his people, counting the procreation of children and their good education among the chiefest of God's benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013">Psalms 144:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 144:13</a></font></span></p>[That] our (l) garners [may be] full, affording all manner of store: [that] our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That the corners of our houses may be full of store for the great abundance of your blessings.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014">Psalms 144:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 144:14</a></font></span></p>[That] our (m) oxen [may be] strong to labour; [that there be] no breaking in, nor going out; that [there be] no complaining in our streets. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) He attributes not only the great conveniences, but even the least also to God's favour.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015">Psalms 144:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 144:15</a></font></span></p>Happy [is that] people, that is (n) in such a case: [yea], happy [is that] people, whose God [is] the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) And if God does not give to all his children all these blessings, yet he replaces them with better things.
