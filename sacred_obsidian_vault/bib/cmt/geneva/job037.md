 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001">Job 37:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 37:1</a></font></span></p>At this also my heart (a) trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) At the marvelling of the thunder and lightnings: by which he declares that the faithful are lively touched with the majesty of God, when they behold his works.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002">Job 37:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 37:2</a></font></span></p>Hear attentively the (b) noise of his voice, and the sound [that] goeth out of his mouth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is the thunder, by which he speaks to men to waken their dullness, and to bring them to the consideration of his works.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004">Job 37:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 37:4</a></font></span></p>After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay (c) them when his voice is heard. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning, the rains and thunders.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006">Job 37:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 37:6</a></font></span></p>For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth; (d) likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) So that neither small rain nor great, snow nor anything else comes without God's appointment.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007">Job 37:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 37:7</a></font></span></p>He (e) sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) By rains and thunders God causes men to keep themselves within their houses.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009">Job 37:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 37:9</a></font></span></p>Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the (f) north. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) In Hebrew it is called the scattering wind, because it drives away the clouds and purges the air.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010">Job 37:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 37:10</a></font></span></p>By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters (g) is straitened. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, frozen up and dried.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011">Job 37:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 37:11</a></font></span></p>Also by watering he (h) wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his (i) bright cloud: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Gather the vapours and move to and fro to water the earth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) That is, the cloud that has lightning in it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013">Job 37:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 37:13</a></font></span></p>He causeth it to come, whether for (k) correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Rain, cold, heat, tempests and such like are sent from God, either to punish man, or to profit the earth, or to declare his favour toward man, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031">Job 36:31</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015">Job 37:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 37:15</a></font></span></p>Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the (l) light of his cloud to shine? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) That is, the lightning to break forth in the clouds?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016">Job 37:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 37:16</a></font></span></p>Dost thou know the (m) balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Which is sometimes changed into rain, or snow, hail or such like.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017">Job 37:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 37:17</a></font></span></p>How thy garments [are] (n) warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south [wind]? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Why your clothes should keep you warm when the south wind blows rather than when any other wind blows?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018">Job 37:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 37:18</a></font></span></p>Hast thou with him spread out the sky, [which is] strong, [and] as a molten looking (o) glass? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) For the clearness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019">Job 37:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 37:19</a></font></span></p>Teach us what we shall say unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of (p) darkness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) That is, our ignorance: signifying that Job was so presumptuous, that he would control the works of God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020">Job 37:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 37:20</a></font></span></p>Shall it be (q) told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Has God need that any should tell him when man murmurs against him?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021">Job 37:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 37:21</a></font></span></p>And now [men] see not the bright light (s) which [is] in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) The cloud stops the shining of the sun, that man cannot see it till the wind has chased away the cloud: and if man is not able to attain to the knowledge of these things, how much less God's judgments?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022">Job 37:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 37:22</a></font></span></p>(t) Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God [is] terrible majesty. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) In Hebrew, gold, meaning fair weather and clear as gold.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023">Job 37:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 37:23</a></font></span></p>[Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: [he is] excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not (u) afflict. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) Meaning, without cause.
