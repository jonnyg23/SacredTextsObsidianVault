 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001">Genesis 43:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 43:1</a></font></span></p>And the (a) famine [was] sore in the land. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This was a great temptation to Jacob to suffer such a great famine in the land where God had promised to bless him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#012">Genesis 43:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 43:12</a></font></span></p>And take (b) double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry [it] again in your hand; peradventure it [was] an oversight: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) When we are in need or danger, God does not forbid us to use honest means to better our estate and condition.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014">Genesis 43:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 43:14</a></font></span></p>And (c) God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be (d) bereaved [of my children], I am bereaved. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Our main trust should be in God, not in worldly means. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) He speaks these words not so much in despair, but to make his sons more careful to return with their brother.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#018">Genesis 43:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">gen 43:18</a></font></span></p>And the men were (e) afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) So the judgment of God weighed on their consciences.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#023">Genesis 43:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">gen 43:23</a></font></span></p>And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: (f) your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Despite the corruption of Egypt, Joseph taught his family to fear God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029">Genesis 43:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">gen 43:29</a></font></span></p>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his (g) mother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) For only these two were born of Rachel.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032">Genesis 43:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">gen 43:32</a></font></span></p>And they (h) set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that [is] an (i) abomination unto the Egyptians. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) To signify his dignity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) The nature of the superstitions is to condemn all others in respect to themselves.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034">Genesis 43:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">gen 43:34</a></font></span></p>And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, (k) and were merry with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Sometimes this word means "to be drunken", but here it means that they had enough, and drank of the best wine.
