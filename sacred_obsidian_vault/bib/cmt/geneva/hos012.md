 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001">Hosea 12:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 12:1</a></font></span></p>Ephraim feedeth (a) on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and (b) oil is carried into Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, flatters himself with vain confidence. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning presents to get friendship.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002">Hosea 12:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 12:2</a></font></span></p>The LORD hath also a controversy with (c) Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which in those points was similar to Ephraim, but not in idolatry.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003">Hosea 12:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">hos 12:3</a></font></span></p>He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had (d) power with God: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Seeing that God in this way preferred Jacob their father, Judah's ingratitude was the more to be abhorred.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004">Hosea 12:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">hos 12:4</a></font></span></p>Yea, he had (e) power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: (f) he found him [in] Bethel, and there he spake with us; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024">Gen 32:24-32</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) God found Jacob as he lay sleeping in Bethel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012">Gen 28:12</a>), and spoke with him there in such a way that the fruit of that speech appertained to the whole body of the people, of which we are.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007">Hosea 12:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">hos 12:7</a></font></span></p>[He is] (g) a merchant, the balances of deceit [are] in his hand: he loveth to oppress. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As for Ephraim, he is more like the wicked Canaanites than godly Abraham or Jacob.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008">Hosea 12:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">hos 12:8</a></font></span></p>And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: [in] all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me (h) that [were] sin. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Thus way the wicked measure God's favour by outward prosperity, and like hypocrites cannot endure that any should reprove their doings.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009">Hosea 12:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">hos 12:9</a></font></span></p>And I [that am] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in (i) the days of the solemn feast. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Seeing you will not acknowledge my benefits, I will bring you again to dwell in tents, as in the feast of the Tabernacles, which you now condemn.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011">Hosea 12:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">hos 12:11</a></font></span></p>[Is there] (k) iniquity [in] Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars [are] as heaps in the furrows of the fields. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) The people thought that no man dare have spoken against Gilead, that holy place, and yet the Prophet says that all their religion was but vanity.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012">Hosea 12:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">hos 12:12</a></font></span></p>(l) And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) If you boast of your riches and nobility, you seem to reproach your father, who was a poor fugitive and servant.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#013">Hosea 12:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">hos 12:13</a></font></span></p>And by a (m) prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Meaning Moses, by which appears that whatever they have, it comes from God's free goodness.
