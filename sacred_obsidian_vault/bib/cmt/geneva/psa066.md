 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001">Psalms 66:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 66:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Song [or] Psalm." Make a joyful noise unto God, (a) all ye lands: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He prophecies that all nations will come to the knowledge of God, who then was only known in Judea.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003">Psalms 66:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 66:3</a></font></span></p>Say unto God, How terrible [art thou in] thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies (b) submit themselves unto thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) As the faithful obey God willingly, so the infidels disguise themselves as obedient out of fear.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005">Psalms 66:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 66:5</a></font></span></p>(c) Come and see the works of God: [he is] terrible [in his] doing toward the (d) children of men. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He refers to the slothful dullness of man, who is cold in the consideration of God's works. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) His providence is wonderful in maintaining their estate.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007">Psalms 66:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 66:7</a></font></span></p>He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious (e) exalt themselves. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He proves that God will extend his grace also to the Gentiles, because he punishes among them such as will not obey his calling.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009">Psalms 66:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 66:9</a></font></span></p>Which (f) holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He signifies some special benefit that God had showed to his Church of the Jews, in delivering them from some great danger: of which he promises that the Gentiles will also be partakers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011">Psalms 66:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 66:11</a></font></span></p>Thou broughtest us into the (g) net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) The condition of the Church is here described, which is to be led by God's providence into troubles, to be subject under tyrants, and to enter into many dangers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013">Psalms 66:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 66:13</a></font></span></p>I will go into thy (h) house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The duty of the faithful is here described, who are never mindful to render God praise for his benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016">Psalms 66:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">psa 66:16</a></font></span></p>(i) Come [and] hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) It is not enough to have received God's benefits and to be mindful of it, but also we are bound to make others profit by it and praise God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018">Psalms 66:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 66:18</a></font></span></p>(k) If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear [me]: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) If I delight in wickedness, God will not hear me, but if I confess it, he will receive me.
