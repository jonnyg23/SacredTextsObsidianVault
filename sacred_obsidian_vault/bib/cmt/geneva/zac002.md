 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001">Zechariah 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 2:1</a></font></span></p>I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a (a) man with a measuring line in his hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This is the angel who was Christ: for in respect of his office he is often called an angel, but in respect of his eternal essence, is God, and so called.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004">Zechariah 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">zac 2:4</a></font></span></p>And said to him, Run, speak to this (b) young man, saying, (c) Jerusalem shall be inhabited [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Meaning himself, Zechariah. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Signifying the spiritual Jerusalem and Church under Christ, which would be extended by the Gospel through all the world, and would need no material walls, nor trust in any worldly strength, but would be safely preserved and dwell in peace among all their enemies.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005">Zechariah 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 2:5</a></font></span></p>For I, saith the LORD, will be to her a wall of (d) fire on every side, and will (e) be the glory in the midst of her. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) To defend my Church, to strike fear in the enemies, and to destroy them if they approach near. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) In me they will have their full felicity and glory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006">Zechariah 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 2:6</a></font></span></p>Ho, ho, [come (f) forth], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four (g) winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He calls to those who partly for fear, and partly for their own case, remained still in captivity, and so preferred their own personal benefits to the benefits of God promised in his Church. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) As it was I that scattered you, so I have power to restore you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007">Zechariah 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 2:7</a></font></span></p>(h) Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest [with] the daughter of Babylon. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) By fleeing from Babylon, and coming to the Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008">Zechariah 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 2:8</a></font></span></p>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the (i) glory hath he sent me to the nations which wasted you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the (k) apple of his eye. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Seeing that God had begun to show his grace among you by delivering you, he continues the same still toward you, and therefore sends me his angel and his Christ to defend you from your enemies, so that they will not hurt you, neither along the way nor at home. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) You are so dear to God, that he can no more allow your enemies to hurt you, than a man can endure to be thrust in the eye; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008">Psa 17:8</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009">Zechariah 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zac 2:9</a></font></span></p>For, behold, I will shake my hand (l) upon them, and (m) they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath (n) sent me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Upon the heathen your enemies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) They will be your servants, as you have been theirs. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) This must necessarily be understood of Christ, who being God equal with his Father, was sent, as he was Mediator to dwell in his Church and to govern them.
