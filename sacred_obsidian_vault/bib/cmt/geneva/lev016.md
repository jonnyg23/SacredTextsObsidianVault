 <p>
 </p><p>(b) In Hebrew it is called Azazel, which some say is a mountain near Sinai, where this goat was sent. Rather it is called the scapegoat because it was not offered but sent into the desert, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#011">Lev 16:11</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) The holiest of holies.

 <p>
 </p><p>(d) That is, on the side which was toward the people: for the head of the sanctuary stood westward.

 <p>
