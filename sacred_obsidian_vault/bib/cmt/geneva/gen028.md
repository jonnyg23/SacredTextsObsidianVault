 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#001">Genesis 28:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 28:1</a></font></span></p>And Isaac called Jacob, and (a) blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) This second blessing was to confirm Jacob's faith, lest he should think that his father had given it without God's leading.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#004">Genesis 28:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 28:4</a></font></span></p>And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a (b) stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) The godly fathers were continually reminded that they were but strangers in this world: so that they would lift up their eyes to the heavens where they have a certain dwelling.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009">Genesis 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 28:9</a></font></span></p>Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of (c) Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Thinking by this to have reconciled himself to his father, but all in vain: for he does not take away the cause of the evil.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012">Genesis 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 28:12</a></font></span></p>And he dreamed, and behold a (d) ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Christ is the ladder by which God and man are joined together, and by whom the angels minister to us: all graces are given to us by him, and we ascend to heaven by him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013">Genesis 28:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 28:13</a></font></span></p>And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I [am] the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee (e) will I give it, and to thy seed; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He felt the force of this promise only by faith: for all his life he was a stranger in this land.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017">Genesis 28:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">gen 28:17</a></font></span></p>And he was (f) afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this [is] none other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He was touched with a godly fear and reverence.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018">Genesis 28:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">gen 28:18</a></font></span></p>And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put [for] his pillows, and (g) set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) To be a reminder of the vision shown to him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020">Genesis 28:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 28:20</a></font></span></p>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If (h) God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) He does not bind God under this condition, but acknowledges his infirmity, and promises to be thankful.
