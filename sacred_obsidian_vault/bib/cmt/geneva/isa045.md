 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isaiah 45:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 45:1</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to (a) Cyrus, whose (b) right hand I have held, to (c) subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) To assure the Jews of their deliverance against the great temptations that they would abide, he names the person and the means. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) Because Cyrus would execute the office of a deliverer, God called him his anointed for a time, but after another sort than he called David. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) To guide him in the deliverance of my people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#002">Isaiah 45:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 45:2</a></font></span></p>I will go before thee, and make the (d) crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut asunder the bars of iron: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) I will take away all impediments and hindrances.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003">Isaiah 45:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 45:3</a></font></span></p>And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest (e) know that I, the LORD, who call [thee] by thy name, [am] the God of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Not that Cyrus knew God to worship him correctly, but he had a certain particular knowledge as profane men may have of his power, and so was compelled to deliver God's people.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004">Isaiah 45:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 45:4</a></font></span></p>For Jacob my servant's (f) sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Not for anything that is in you, or for your worthiness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005">Isaiah 45:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 45:5</a></font></span></p>I [am] the LORD, and [there is] none else, [there is] no God besides me: I (g) girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) I have given you strength, power and authority.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007">Isaiah 45:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 45:7</a></font></span></p>I form the (h) light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these [things]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) I send peace and war, prosperity and adversity, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006">Amo 3:6</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008">Isaiah 45:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 45:8</a></font></span></p>Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down (i) righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have (k) created it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He comforts the Jews as if he would say, "Though when you look to the heavens and earth for comfort you see nothing now but signs of God's wrath, yet will cause them to bring forth certain tokens of your deliverance, and of the performance of my promise": which is meant by righteousness. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) I have appointed Cyrus to this use and purpose.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isaiah 45:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 45:9</a></font></span></p>(l) Woe to him that contendeth with his Maker! [Let] the potsherd [contend] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, (m) He hath no hands? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) By this he bridles their impatience, who in adversity and trouble murmur against God, and will not tarry his pleasure: willing that man would match with his like, and not contend against God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(m) That is, it is not perfectly made.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011">Isaiah 45:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 45:11</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me (n) of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Instead of murmuring, humble yourselves and ask what you will for the consolation of my children, and you will be sure of it as you are of these things which are at your command. Some read it with an interrogation, and make it the application of the comparison.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012">Isaiah 45:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 45:12</a></font></span></p>I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, [even] my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their (o) host have I commanded. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, the stars.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isaiah 45:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 45:13</a></font></span></p>I have raised (p) him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for (q) price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) That is, Cyrus, that I may show by him the faithfulness of my promise in delivering my people. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(q) Meaning, freely and without ransom, or any grievous condition.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014">Isaiah 45:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 45:14</a></font></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, The labour (r) of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be (s) thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee, they shall make supplication to thee, [saying], Surely God [is] in thee; and [there is] none else, [there is] no God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) These people were tributaries to the Persians, and so king Artahshashte gave this money toward the building of the temple, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027">Ezr 7:27</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(s) While they were your enemies, they will now honour you and you will rule them: which was accomplished in the time of Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015">Isaiah 45:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">isa 45:15</a></font></span></p>Verily thou [art] a God that (t) hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) By this he exhorts the Jews to patience, though their deliverance is deferred for a time: showing that they would not repent their long patience, but the wicked and idolaters will be destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018">Isaiah 45:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">isa 45:18</a></font></span></p>For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be (u) inhabited: I [am] the LORD; and [there is] none else. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) That is, of men, but chiefly of his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019">Isaiah 45:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 45:19</a></font></span></p>I have not spoken in secret, (x) in a dark place of the earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) As do the false gods, who give uncertain answers.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020">Isaiah 45:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 45:20</a></font></span></p>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, (y) ye [that have] escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god [that] cannot save. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) All you idolaters who though you seem to have worldly dignity yet in God's sight you are vile and abject.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022">Isaiah 45:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">isa 45:22</a></font></span></p>Look to me, and be ye saved, all (z) the ends of the earth: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) He calls the idolaters to repentance, willing them to look on him with the eye of faith.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isaiah 45:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">isa 45:23</a></font></span></p>I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth [in] (a) righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every (b) knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, that the thing which I have promise will be faithfully performed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) The knowledge of God and the true worshipping will be through all the world, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011">Rom 14:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Phi 2:10</a>) by which he signifies that we must not only serve God in heart, but declare the same also by outward profession.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024">Isaiah 45:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 45:24</a></font></span></p>Surely, (c) shall [one] say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: [even] to him shall [men] come; and all that are (d) incensed against him shall be ashamed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Meaning the faithful will feel and confess this. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) All the contemners of God.
