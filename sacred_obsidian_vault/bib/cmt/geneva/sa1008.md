 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 8:1</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he (a) made his sons judges over Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Because he was not able to bear the charge. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 8:2</a></font></span></p>Now the name of his firstborn was (b) Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: [they were] judges in Beersheba. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Who was also called Vashni, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028">Ch1 6:28</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 8:4</a></font></span></p>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto (c) Ramah, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) For there his house was, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017">Sa1 7:17</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 8:6</a></font></span></p>But the thing (d) displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Because they were not content with the order that God had appointed, but would be governed as the Gentiles were. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 8:9</a></font></span></p>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet (e) protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) To prove if they will forsake their wicked purpose. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 8:11</a></font></span></p>And he said, This will be the (f) manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] shall run before his chariots. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Not that kings have this authority by their office, but that such as reign in God's wrath would usurp this over their brethren, contrary to the law, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020">Deu 17:20</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#018">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa1 8:18</a></font></span></p>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not (g) hear you in that day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Because you do not repent for your sins, but because you long for your afflictions, into which you cast yourselves willingly.
