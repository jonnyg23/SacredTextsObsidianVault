 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001">Psalms 69:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 69:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician upon (a) Shoshannim, [A Psalm] of David." Save me, O God; for the (b) waters are come in unto [my] soul. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Of Shoshannim, read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001">Psa 45:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) David shows by the waters the great dangers he was in, out of which God delivered him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002">Psalms 69:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 69:2</a></font></span></p>I sink in deep mire, where [there is] no (c) standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) No stable firmness to settle my feet.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003">Psalms 69:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 69:3</a></font></span></p>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine (d) eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Though his senses failed him, yet his faith was constant and encouraged him still to pray.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004">Psalms 69:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 69:4</a></font></span></p>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, [being] mine enemies (e) wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored [that] which I (f) took not away. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Condemning me as guilty. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) They judged me a thief, though innocent, and gave my goods to others, as though I had stolen them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005">Psalms 69:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 69:5</a></font></span></p>O God, thou knowest my (g) foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Though I am guilty toward you, yet I am innocent toward them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006">Psalms 69:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 69:6</a></font></span></p>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for (h) my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Do not let my evil entreaty of the enemy be an opportunity for the faithful to fall from you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psalms 69:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 69:9</a></font></span></p>(i) For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) When I saw your enemies claim your Name in mouth only, and in their life deny the same, your Holy Spirit thrust me forward to reprove them and defend your glory.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010">Psalms 69:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 69:10</a></font></span></p>When I (k) wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) My zeal moved me to lament and pray for my salvation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012">Psalms 69:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 69:12</a></font></span></p>They that (l) sit in the gate speak against me; and I [was] the song of the drunkards. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The more he sought to win them to God, the more they were against him both the poor and the rich.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013">Psalms 69:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 69:13</a></font></span></p>But as for me, my prayer [is] unto thee, O LORD, [in] an (m) acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Knowing that even though I endure trouble now, yet you have a time in which you have appointed my deliverance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014">Psalms 69:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 69:14</a></font></span></p>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the (n) deep waters. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) He shows a living faith, in that he believes that God is favourable towards him when he seems to be angry and at hand when he seems to be far off.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017">Psalms 69:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 69:17</a></font></span></p>And (o) hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) Not that he feared that God would not hear him, but that care made him think that God delayed too long.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019">Psalms 69:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 69:19</a></font></span></p>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine (p) adversaries [are] all before thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) You see that I am beset as a sheep among many wolves.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#020">Psalms 69:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">psa 69:20</a></font></span></p>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and (q) I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] none; and for comforters, but I found none. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) He shows men that it is vain to put our trust in men in our great necessity, but that our comfort only depends on God: for man increases our sorrows, then diminishes them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029">Joh 19:29</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022">Psalms 69:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">psa 69:22</a></font></span></p>Let their (r) table become a snare before them: and [that which should have been] for [their] welfare, [let it become] a trap. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) He desires God to execute his judgments against the reprobate, which cannot by any means be turned, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009">Rom 11:9</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023">Psalms 69:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">psa 69:23</a></font></span></p>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their (s) loins continually to shake. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) Take both judgment and power from them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020">Act 1:20</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025">Psalms 69:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">psa 69:25</a></font></span></p>Let their (t) habitation be desolate; [and] let none dwell in their tents. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) Punish not only them, but their posterity, who will be like them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027">Psalms 69:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">psa 69:27</a></font></span></p>Add (u) iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(u) By their continuance and increasing in their sins, let it be known that they are of the reprobate.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028">Psalms 69:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">psa 69:28</a></font></span></p>Let them be blotted out of the (x) book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(x) They who seemed by their profession to have been written in your book, yet by their fruits prove the contrary, let them be known as reprobates.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031">Psalms 69:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">psa 69:31</a></font></span></p>[This] also shall please the LORD better than an ox [or] (y) bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(y) There is no sacrifice which God values more than thanksgiving for his benefits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033">Psalms 69:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">psa 69:33</a></font></span></p>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his (z) prisoners. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(z) For as he delivered his servant David, so will he do for all that are in distress and call on him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#036">Psalms 69:36</a></p>
