 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001">Numbers 22:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">num 22:1</a></font></span></p>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on (a) this side Jordan [by] Jericho. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Being at Jericho, it was beyond the Jordan, but where the Israelites were, it was on this side.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004">Numbers 22:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">num 22:4</a></font></span></p>And Moab said unto the (b) elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Who were the heads and governors.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005">Numbers 22:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">num 22:5</a></font></span></p>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the (c) river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, Euphrates, upon which stood this city Pethor.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#007">Numbers 22:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">num 22:7</a></font></span></p>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with (d) the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Thinking to bribe him with gifts to curse the Israelites.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#008">Numbers 22:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">num 22:8</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and (e) the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Whom before he called elders: meaning the governors, and later calls them servants: that is, subjects to their king.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012">Numbers 22:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">num 22:12</a></font></span></p>And God (f) said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) He warned him by a dream, that he should not consent to the kings wicked request.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#013">Numbers 22:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">num 22:13</a></font></span></p>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give (g) me leave to go with you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Or else he would have been willing, covetousness had so blinded his heart.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#016">Numbers 22:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">num 22:16</a></font></span></p>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, (h) Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) The wicked seek by all means to further their naughty enterprises, though they know that God is against them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#019">Numbers 22:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">num 22:19</a></font></span></p>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me (i) more. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Because he tempted God to require him contrary to his commandment, his petition was granted, but it turned to his own condemnation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022">Numbers 22:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">num 22:22</a></font></span></p>And God's anger was kindled because he (k) went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) Moved rather with covetousness than to obey God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024">Numbers 22:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">num 22:24</a></font></span></p>(l) But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) The second time.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028">Numbers 22:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">num 22:28</a></font></span></p>And the LORD (m) opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) Gave her power to speak.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#030">Numbers 22:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">num 22:30</a></font></span></p>And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever (n) since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) Since you have been my master.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#031">Numbers 22:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">num 22:31</a></font></span></p>Then the LORD (o) opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) For if the Lord does not open your eyes, you can see neither his anger or his love.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032">Numbers 22:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">num 22:32</a></font></span></p>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] (p) way is perverse before me: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) Both your heart is corrupt and your enterprise wicked.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#035">Numbers 22:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">num 22:35</a></font></span></p>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the (q) word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Because his heart was evil, his charge was renewed, that he should not pretend ignorance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036">Numbers 22:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">num 22:36</a></font></span></p>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the (r) border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost coast. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(r) Near the place where the Israelites camped.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038">Numbers 22:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">num 22:38</a></font></span></p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say (s) any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(s) On my own I can say nothing, I will only speak what God reveals, whether it is good or bad.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041">Numbers 22:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">num 22:41</a></font></span></p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of (t) Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of the people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(t) Where the idol Baal was worshipped.
