 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001">Psalms 149:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 149:1</a></font></span></p>Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD (a) a new song, [and] his praise in the congregation of saints. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) For his rare and manifold benefits bestowed on his Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002">Psalms 149:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 149:2</a></font></span></p>Let Israel rejoice in him that (b) made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their (c) King. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) In that they were preferred before all other nations, it was a new creation, and therefore (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007">Psa 95:7</a>) they were called the sheep of God's hands. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) For God as he is the creator of the soul and body, so will he that both two serve him, and that his people be continually subject to him, as to their most lawful king.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005">Psalms 149:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 149:5</a></font></span></p>Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their (d) beds. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) He alludes to that continual rest and quietness which they should have if they would suffer God to rule them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007">Psalms 149:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 149:7</a></font></span></p>(e) To execute vengeance upon the heathen, [and] punishments upon the people; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) This is chiefly accomplished in the kingdom of Christ when God's people for just causes execute God's judgments against his enemies and it gives no liberty to any to avenge their private injuries.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008">Psalms 149:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 149:8</a></font></span></p>To bind (f) their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Not only the people, but the kings who were their enemies should be destroyed.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009">Psalms 149:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 149:9</a></font></span></p>To execute upon them the judgment (g) written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) By this God binds the hands and minds of all his to enterprise no farther than he appoints.
