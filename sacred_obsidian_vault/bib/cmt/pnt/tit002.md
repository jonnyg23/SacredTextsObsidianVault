 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_000">tit 2:0</a></font></span></p>SUMMARY.--Duties of the Aged. Of the Young Men and Women. Of Servants. Christian Life. Christian Hope. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001">Titus 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">tit 2:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>
 </p><p>Speak . . . sound doctrine. Instead of inculcating Jewish fables and speculations impart healthy teaching; teach practical duties. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That the aged men be sober. Not given to wine. We must keep in mind that the converts had recently been given to heathen vices. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Temperate. Exhibiting self-control. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Sound in faith. True believers. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>In patience. Steadfastly persevering. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The aged women likewise. One general rule is given, in effect that they seek holy lives. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Not false accusers. Not given to slander, and insinuations of evil, a fault by no means uncommon among certain classes of women. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Teachers of good things. Both by example and precept. How beautiful is an aged Christian woman of saintly life! 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That they may teach. A special mission is to teach the young women. What they were to be taught follows. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>To be discreet. How often thoughtless indiscretion has caused great pain and trouble! 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Keepers at home. Those who are continually going must neglect the duties of domestic life. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013">Ti1 5:13</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Young men . . . be sober-minded. The precept, sober-minded, occurs four times in six verses, and may be accounted for by the volatile character of the Cretans. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012">Tit 1:12-13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007">Titus 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">tit 2:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>
 </p><p>Showing thyself a pattern. While exhorting others. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Showing uncorruptness. Sincerity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Sound speech. Speech of a healthy, moral effect. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>He that is of the contrary part. Opposers, whether heathen, Jews, or false teachers. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009">Titus 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">tit 2:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>
 </p><p>Exhort servants. Slaves. See notes on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005">Eph 6:5-8</a>. Many of the first converts were servants. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Not purloining. Men robbed of liberty and labor have always been under temptation to steal. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Good fidelity. Faithfulness in duty which will secure the master's confidence. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That they may adorn. The virtues of a Christian servant would commend Christianity to the master. As a matter of fact we know that many masters were converted by their servants. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011">Titus 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">tit 2:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>
 </p><p>Hath appeared to all men. The divine favor shown forth in the gospel of salvation is for all men, servants as well as masters. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Teaching us. We are taught in this system of grace that we must deny ourselves all sinful lusts, and live godly lives. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Looking for. The attitude of Christians is that of waiting in expectation of the fulfillment of a glorious hope. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007">Co1 1:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020">Phi 3:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009">Th1 1:9</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Who gave himself. The Lord who will appear gave the greatest of all things, himself, for us. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That he might redeem us. To deliver us from sin, not only from its power, but its penalty. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>A peculiar people. Separate, chosen, holy in life. The Jews were, under the old covenant, a peculiar people; now, Christians, are God's Israel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Let no man despise thee. Command respect.
