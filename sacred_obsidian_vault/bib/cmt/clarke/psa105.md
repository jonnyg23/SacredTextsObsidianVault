 <p>An exhortation to praise God for his wondrous works, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001">Psa 105:1-5</a>; his goodness to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006">Psa 105:6-16</a>; to Joseph in Egypt, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#017">Psa 105:17-22</a>; to Israel in Egypt, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023">Psa 105:23-25</a>; to Moses in the same land, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026">Psa 105:26</a>; the plagues sent on the Egyptians, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027">Psa 105:27-36</a>; the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037">Psa 105:37</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#038">Psa 105:38</a>; how he supported them in the wilderness, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039">Psa 105:39-43</a>; and brought them into Canaan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044">Psa 105:44</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045">Psa 105:45</a>.
 </p><p>We find several verses of this Psalm in 1 Chronicles 16, from which it is evident that David was the author of the principal part of it: but it was probably enlarged and sung at the restoration of the people from the Babylonish captivity. The hallelujah which terminates the preceding Psalm, is made the title of this by the Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic, and Arabic: but it has no title either in the Hebrew or Chaldee. The Syriac considers it a paraphrase on the words, "Fear not, Jacob, to go down into Egypt; and teach us spiritually not to fear when we are obliged to contend with devils; for God is our shield, and will fight for us." The Psalm is a history of God's dealings with Abraham and his posterity, till their settlement in the promised land. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001">Psalms 105:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 105:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>O give thanks - He had been meditating on God's gracious dealings with their fathers; and he calls upon himself and all others to magnify God for his mercies. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002">Psalms 105:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 105:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Talk ye of all his wondrous works - נפלאתיו  niphleothaiv, "of his miracles." Who have so many of these to boast of as Christians! Christianity is a tissue of miracles; and every part of the work of grace on the soul is a miracle. Genuine Christian converts may talk of miracles from morning to night; and they should talk of them, and recommend to others their miracle-working God and Savior. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003">Psalms 105:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 105:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Glory ye in his holy name - Show the name Jesus: exult in it - praise it. His name was called Jesus; because he came to save his people from their sins.
 </p><p>Let the heart of them rejoice - That is, the heart of those shall rejoice who seek the Lord: therefore it is added: -  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004">Psalms 105:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 105:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Seek the Lord - Worship the one only Supreme Being, as the only and all-sufficient good for the soul of man.
 </p><p>And his strength - Man is weak; and needs connection with the strong God that he may be enabled to avoid evil and do good.
 </p><p>Seek his face - Reconciliation to him. Live not without a sense of his favor.
 </p><p>Evermore - Let this be thy chief business. In and above all thy seeking, seek this. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005">Psalms 105:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 105:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Remember his marvellous works - Keep up communion with thy Maker, that thou mayest neither forget him nor his works.
 </p><p>The judgments of his mouth - Whatsoever he has spoken concerning good or evil. His commands, promises, threatenings; and particularly what he has foretold, and what he has done. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006">Psalms 105:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 105:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>O ye seed of Abraham - Ye Jews especially, who have been the peculiar objects of the Divine favor. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007">Psalms 105:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 105:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He is the Lord our God - He is Jehovah, the self-existent and eternal God. He is our God, he is our portion; has taken us for his people, and makes us happy in his love.
 </p><p>The following abstract of the history of the Israelites presents but few difficulties. See the notes on Psalm 78 (note). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012">Psalms 105:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 105:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But a few men - When all appearances were against them, and nothing but the arm of God could have brought them through their difficulties, and given them a settlement in the promised land. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013">Psalms 105:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 105:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>When they went from one nation to another - From several circumstances in the history of the travels of the ancient Hebrews, we find that the wilderness through which they then passed was well peopled. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015">Psalms 105:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 105:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Touch not mine anointed - It is supposed that the patriarchs are here intended; but the whole people of Israel may be meant. They were a kingdom of priests and kings unto God; and prophets, priests, and kings were always anointed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019">Psalms 105:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">psa 105:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Until the time that his word came - This appears to refer to the completion of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the chief butler and baker.
 </p><p>The Word of the Lord tried him - This seems to refer to the interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams, called אמרת יהוה  imrath Yehovah, "the oracle of the Lord," because sent by him to Pharaoh. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#026">Gen 41:26</a>, and Kennicott in loco. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025">Psalms 105:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">psa 105:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He turned their heart - "Their heart was turned." So the Syriac and Arabic. After befriending the Hebrews on Joseph's account, to whom they were so deeply indebted, finding them to multiply greatly in the land, and at last to become more powerful than the Egyptians themselves, they turned their attention to the adoption of measures, in order to prevent the Hebrews from possessing themselves of the government of the whole land; they curtailed them of their privileges, and endeavored to depress them by all possible means, and by a variety of legal enactments. This appears to be the sole meaning of the phrase, "He turned their heart;" or, "their heart was turned." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027">Psalms 105:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">psa 105:27</a></font></span></p>
 <p>They showed his signs - Here is a reference to the plagues with which God afflicted the Egyptians. See Exodus 7-12 (note), <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043">Psa 78:43</a> (note), and the notes on them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028">Psalms 105:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">psa 105:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>They rebelled not against his word - Instead of ולא מרו  velo maru, "they rebelled," some think that a ש  shin has been lost from before the word, and that it should be read ולא שמרו  velo shamru, "they did not observe or keep his word." Or the words may be spoken of Moses and Aaron; they received the commandment of God, and they did not rebel against it. They believed what he had spoken, and acted according to his orders. It could not be spoken of the Egyptians; for they rebelled against his words through the whole course of the transactions. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033">Psalms 105:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">psa 105:33</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He smote their vines also, and their fig trees - This is not mentioned in Exodus; but we have had it before, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047">Psa 78:47</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041">Psalms 105:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">psa 105:41</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He opened the rock, and the waters rushed out - See the note on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006">Exo 17:6</a>, to which I can now add, that a piece of this rock, broken off by the hand of my nephew, E. S. A. Clarke, in the course of the present year [1822,] now lies before me. It is fine granite; and so well distinguished as a granite, that the feldt-spar, the mica, and the quartz, of which granite is composed, appear very distinctly. It is worthy of remark, that, as granite is supposed, in the most accredited systems of geology, to be the very basis of the earth, the original rock, and all other substances to be superimpositions upon it, and as the decompositions of the feldt-spar produce pure vegetable earth, this rock should be used for this purpose, and should be an emblem of Jesus Christ, the Creator and Redeemer of the human race; and that it should signify him who is the basis of all things; who upholds all by the word of his power; without whom nothing is stable, nothing fruitful; from whom alone the water of life proceeds; and in whose name only is salvation. And that rock (in the wilderness) was Christ! and it is the only remaining emblem of him in creation. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045">Psalms 105:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">psa 105:45</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That they might observe his statutes - That they might be properly instructed, and properly disciplined. This is the end proposed by Divine revelation: men are to be made wise unto salvation, and then to be brought under the yoke of obedience. He who is not conformed to God's word shall not enter into Christ's kingdom.
