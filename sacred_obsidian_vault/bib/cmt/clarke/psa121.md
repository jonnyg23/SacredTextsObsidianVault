 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Commentary on the Bible</i>, by Adam Clarke, [1831], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 121</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Psalms</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_000">psa 121:0</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The resolution of a godly man, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psa 121:2</a>. The safety and prosperity of such, as they and theirs shall be under the continual protection of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3-8</a>.
 </p><p>This appears to be a prayer of the Jews in their captivity, who are solicitous for their restoration. It is in the form of a dialogue.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psa 121:2</a>. The person who worships God speaks the two first verses, "I will lift up mine eyes-my help cometh," - <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psa 121:2</a>.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3</a>.  The ministering priest answers him, "He will not suffer thy foot to be moved." "He that keepeth thee will not slumber," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3</a>.
 </p><p>To which the worshipper answers, that he knows that "he who keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004">Psa 121:4</a>; but he seems to express a doubt whether he shall be an object of the Divine attention.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005">Psa 121:5</a> etc. The priest resumes; and, to the conclusion of the Psalm, gives him the most positive assurances of God's favor and protection. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psalms 121:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 121:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Unto the hills - Jerusalem was built upon a mountain; and Judea was a mountainous country; and the Jews, in their several dispersions, turned towards Jerusalem when they offered up their prayers to God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psalms 121:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 121:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>My help cometh from the Lord - There is no help for me but in my God; and I expect it from no other quarter. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psalms 121:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 121:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved - The foundation, God's infinite power and goodness, on which thou standest, cannot be moved; and whilst thou standest on this basis, thy foot cannot be moved. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004">Psalms 121:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 121:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He that keepeth Israel - The Divine Being represents himself as a watchman, who takes care of the city and its inhabitants during the night-watches; and who is never overtaken with slumbering or sleepiness. There is a thought in the Antigone of Sophocles, that seems the counterpart of this of the psalmist,
 </p><p>Ταν σαν, Ζευ, δυναμιν τις ανδρων
 </p><p>Ὑπερβασια κατασχοι,
 </p><p>Ταν ουθ' ὑπνος αἱ - 
 </p><p>ρει ποθ' ὁ παντογηρως,
 </p><p>Ακαματοι τε θεων
 </p><p>Μηνες;
 </p><p>Antig. ver. 613, Edit. Johnson.
 </p><p>Shall men below control great Jove above,Whose eyes by all-subduing sleep
 </p><p>Are never closed, as feeble mortals' are;But still their watchful vigil keep
 </p><p>Through the long circle of th' eternal year?
 </p><p>Franklin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006">Psalms 121:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 121:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The sun shall not smite thee by day - Thus expressed by the Chaldee: "The morning spectres shall not smite thee by day, during the government of the sun; nor the nocturnal spectres by night, during the government of the moon." I believe the psalmist simply means, they shall not be injured by heat nor cold; by a sun-stroke by day, nor a frost-bite by night. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#007">Psalms 121:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 121:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil - Spiritual and corporeal, natural and moral.
 </p><p>He shall preserve thy soul - Take care of thy life, and take care of thy soul. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008">Psalms 121:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 121:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Thy going out and thy coming in - Night and day - in all thy business and undertakings; and this through the whole course of thy life: for evermore.
