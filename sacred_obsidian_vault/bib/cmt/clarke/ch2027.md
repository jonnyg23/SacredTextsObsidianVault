 <p>Jotham succeeds his father Uzziah, and reigns well, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001">Ch2 27:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002">Ch2 27:2</a>.

 <p>He entered not into the temple - He copied his father's conduct as far as it was constitutional; and avoided his transgression. See the preceding chapter, 2 Chronicles 26 (note).

 <p>On the wall of Ophel - The wall, says the Targum, of the interior palace. Ophel was some part of the wall of Jerusalem, that was most pregnable, and therefore Jotham fortified it in a particular manner. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004">2 Chronicles 27:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch2 27:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Castles and towers - These he built for the protection of the country people against marauders. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005">2 Chronicles 27:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch2 27:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He fought also with - the Ammonites - We find here that he brought them under a heavy tribute for three years; but whether this was the effect of his prevailing against them, is not so evident. Some think that they paid this tribute for three years, and then revolted; that, in consequence, he attacked them, and their utter subjection was the result. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007">2 Chronicles 27:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ch2 27:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways - It was in his days, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037">Kg2 15:37</a>, that Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah king of Israel, began to cut Judah short. See the notes on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#036">Kg2 15:36</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037">Kg2 15:37</a>.
 </p><p>Written in the book of the kings, etc. - There is not so much found in the books of Kings which we have now, as in this place of the Chronicles. In both places we have abridged accounts only: the larger histories have long been lost. The reign of Jotham was properly the last politically prosperous reign among the Jews. Hezekiah and Josiah did much to preserve the Divine worship; but Judah continued to be cut short, till at last it was wholly ruined.
