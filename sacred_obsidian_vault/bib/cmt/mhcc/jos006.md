 <p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001">Jos 6:1-5</a>) The siege of Jericho.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006">Jos 6:6-16</a>) The city is compassed.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017">Jos 6:17-27</a>) Jericho is taken, Rahab and her family are saved. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001">Joshua 6:1</a></p>

 <p>Jericho resolves Israel shall not be its master. It shut itself up, being strongly fortified both by art and nature. Thus were they foolish, and their hearts hardened to their destruction; the miserable case of all that strengthen themselves against the Almighty. God resolves Israel shall be its master, and that quickly. No warlike preparations were to be made. By the uncommon method of besieging the city, the Lord honoured the ark, as the symbol of his presence, and showed that all the victories were from him. The faith and patience of the people were proved and increased. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006">Joshua 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jos 6:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Wherever the ark went, the people attended it. God's ministers, by the trumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims liberty and victory, must encourage the followers of Christ in their spiritual warfare. As promised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be expected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so, and the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the walls of Jericho would fall. It was a shout of prayer; they cry to Heaven for help, and help came. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017">Joshua 6:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 6:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Jericho was to be a solemn and awful sacrifice to the justice of God, upon those who had filled up the measure of their sins. So He appoints, from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that believed not, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031">Heb 11:31</a>. All her kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#031">Act 16:31</a>. She, and they with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.
