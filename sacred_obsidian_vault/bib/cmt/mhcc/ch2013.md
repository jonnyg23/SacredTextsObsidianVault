 <p>Abijah overcomes Jeroboam. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001">2 Chronicles 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 13:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severe punishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears from the character of Abijah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003">Kg1 15:3</a>, that he was not himself truly religious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people. It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast of the form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it in others. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers in Judah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should they look for deliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our way thither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer is crying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and became more than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but God struck him; there is no escaping his sword.
