 <p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001">Jer 36:1-8</a>) Baruch is to write the prophecies of Jeremiah.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009">Jer 36:9-19</a>) The princes advise them to hide themselves.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020">Jer 36:20-32</a>) The king having heard a part, burns the roll. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001">Jeremiah 36:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 36:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The writing of the Scriptures was by Divine appointment. The Divine wisdom directed to this as a proper means; if it failed, the house of Judah would be the more without excuse. The Lord declares to sinners the evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear, and fear, and return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makes this use of God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, he will find the Lord ready to forgive his sins. All others will be left without excuse; and the consideration that great is the anger God has pronounced against us for sin, should quicken both our prayers and our endeavours. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009">Jeremiah 36:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 36:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those, who, though they keep up forms of godliness, are strangers and enemies to the power of it. The princes patiently attended the reading of the whole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convinced to the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed to favour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves about their safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not act according to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they find troublesome. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020">Jeremiah 36:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jer 36:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those who despise the word of God, will soon show, as this king did, that they hate it; and, like him, they would wish it destroyed. See what enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, and wonder at his patience. The princes showed some concern, till they saw how light the king made of it. Beware of making light of God's word!
