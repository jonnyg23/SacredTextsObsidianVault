 <p>This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002">Eze 44:2</a>, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.
