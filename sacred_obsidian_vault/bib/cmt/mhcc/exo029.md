 <p>Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, with ceremony and solemnity. Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of our profession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence he is called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty; sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated through sufferings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010">Heb 2:10</a>. All believers are spiritual priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">Pe1 2:5</a>, washed in the blood of Christ, and so made to our God priests, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005">Rev 1:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</a>. They also are clothed with the beauty of holiness, and have received the anointing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027">Jo1 2:27</a>. The Spirit of God is called the finger of God, ( <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020">Luk 11:20</a>, compared with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028">Mat 12:28</a>,) and by him the merit of Christ is applied to our souls. This consecration signifies the admission of a sinner into the spiritual priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

 <p>A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb every evening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once for all, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This also teaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer and praise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the most needful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Those starve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on the throne of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.
