But the righteous and industrious have their desires satisfied. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027">Proverbs 21:27</a></p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030">Proverbs 21:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">pro 21:30</a></font></span></p>
