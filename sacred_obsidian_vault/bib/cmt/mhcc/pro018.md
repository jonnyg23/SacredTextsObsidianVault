 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 18:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>If we would get knowledge and grace, we must try all methods of improving ourselves. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002">Proverbs 18:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 18:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those make nothing to purpose, of learning or religion, whose only design is to have something to make a show with. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003">Proverbs 18:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pro 18:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>As soon as sin entered, shame followed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#004">Proverbs 18:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">pro 18:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The well-spring of wisdom in the heart of a believer, continually supplies words of wisdom. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005">Proverbs 18:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">pro 18:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The merits of a cause must be looked to, not the person. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#006">Proverbs 18:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">pro 18:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues! 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008">Proverbs 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pro 18:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may be expected from small beginnings of jealousy! 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#009">Proverbs 18:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">pro 18:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well as commissions of sin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010">Proverbs 18:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 18:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. How deceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasure in this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his own conceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed to the just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#012">Proverbs 18:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">pro 18:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honour shall be the reward of humility. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#013">Proverbs 18:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 18:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014">Proverbs 18:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">pro 18:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when the conscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear the misery; what then will hell be? 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#015">Proverbs 18:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pro 18:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016">Proverbs 18:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">pro 18:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne, without money and without price. May his gifts make room for him in our souls. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017">Proverbs 18:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pro 18:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is well to listen to our enemies, that we may form a better judgment of ourselves. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018">Proverbs 18:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">pro 18:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It was customary sometimes to refer matters to God, by casting lots, with solemn prayer. The profaning the lot, by using it in matters of diversion, or coveting what belongs to others, forms an objection to this now. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019">Proverbs 18:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">pro 18:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Great care must be taken to prevent quarrels among relations and those under obligations to each other. Wisdom and grace make it easy to forgive; but corruption makes it difficult. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#020">Proverbs 18:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">pro 18:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The belly is here put for the heart, as elsewhere; and what that is filled with, our satisfaction will be accordingly, and our inward peace. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#021">Proverbs 18:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 18:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Many a one has caused his own death, or the death of others, by a false or injurious tongue. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022">Proverbs 18:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pro 18:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A good wife is a great blessing to a man, and it is a token of Divine favour. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#023">Proverbs 18:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">pro 18:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Poverty tells men they must not order or demand. And at the throne of God's grace we are all poor, and must use entreaties. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024">Proverbs 18:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">pro 18:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Christ Jesus never will forsake those who trust in and love him. May we be such friends to others, for our Master's sake. Having loved his own, which were in the world, he loved them unto the end; and we are his friends if we do whatever he commands us, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014">Joh 15:14</a>.
