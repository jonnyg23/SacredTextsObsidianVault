 <p>We may usefully select passages from different psalms, as here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001">Psa 57:1-11</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001">Psa 60:1-12</a>, to help our devotions, and enliven our gratitude. When the heart is firm in faith and love, the tongue, being employed in grateful praises, is our glory. Every gift of the Lord honours and profits the possessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory. Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessings of salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise and covenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble, and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation, with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.
