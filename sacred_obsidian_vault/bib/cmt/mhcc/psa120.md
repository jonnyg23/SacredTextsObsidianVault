 <p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001">Psa 120:1-4</a>) The psalmist prays to God to deliver him from false and malicious tongues.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005">Psa 120:5-7</a>) He complains of wicked neighbours.

 <p>The psalmist was brought into great distress by a deceitful tongue. May every good man be delivered from lying lips. They forged false charges against him. In this distress, he sought God by fervent prayer. God can bridle their tongues. He obtained a gracious answer to this prayer. Surely sinners durst not act as they do, if they knew, and would be persuaded to think, what will be in the end thereof. The terrors of the Lord are his arrows; and his wrath is compared to burning coals of juniper, which have a fierce heat, and keep fire very long. This is the portion of the false tongue; for all that love and make a lie, shall have their portion in the lake that burns eternally. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005">Psalms 120:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 120:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is very grievous to a good man, to be cast into, and kept in the company of the wicked, from whom he hopes to be for ever separated. See here the character of a good man; he is for living peaceably with all men. And let us follow David as he prefigured Christ; in our distress let us cry unto the Lord, and he will hear us. Let us follow after peace and holiness, striving to overcome evil with good.
