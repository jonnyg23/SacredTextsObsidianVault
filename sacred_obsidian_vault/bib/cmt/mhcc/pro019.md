 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001">Proverbs 19:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 19:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A poor man who fears God, is more honourable and happy, than a man without wisdom and grace, however rich or advanced in rank. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002">Proverbs 19:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 19:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What good can the soul do, if without knowledge? And he sins who will not take time to ponder the path of his feet. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003">Proverbs 19:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pro 19:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#004">Proverbs 19:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">pro 19:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005">Proverbs 19:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">pro 19:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006">Proverbs 19:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">pro 19:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007">Proverbs 19:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">pro 19:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008">Proverbs 19:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pro 19:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#009">Proverbs 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">pro 19:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010">Proverbs 19:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 19:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy. It is very unseemly for one who is a servant to sin, to oppress God's free-men. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011">Proverbs 19:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">pro 19:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He attains the most true glory who endeavours most steadily to overcome evil with good. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012">Proverbs 19:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">pro 19:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Christ is a King, whose wrath against his enemies will be as the roaring of a lion, and his favour to his people as the refreshing dew. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013">Proverbs 19:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 19:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It shows the vanity of the world, that we are liable to the greatest griefs where we promise ourselves the greatest comfort. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014">Proverbs 19:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">pro 19:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#015">Proverbs 19:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pro 19:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#016">Proverbs 19:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">pro 19:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017">Proverbs 19:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pro 19:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#018">Proverbs 19:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">pro 19:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>When parents keep under foolish tenderness, they do their best to render children a comfort to them, and happy in themselves. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019">Proverbs 19:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">pro 19:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The spared and spoiled child is likely to become a man of great wrath. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#020">Proverbs 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">pro 19:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those that would be wise in their latter end, must be taught and ruled when young. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021">Proverbs 19:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 19:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What should we desire, but that all our purposes may agree with God's holy will? 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022">Proverbs 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pro 19:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023">Proverbs 19:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">pro 19:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those that live in the fear of God, shall get safety, satisfaction, and true and complete happiness. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#024">Proverbs 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">pro 19:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Indolence, when indulged, so grows upon people, that they have no heart to do the most needful things for themselves. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025">Proverbs 19:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">pro 19:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A gentle rebuke goes farthest with a man of understanding. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#026">Proverbs 19:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">pro 19:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The young man who wastes his father's substance, or makes his aged mother destitute, is hateful, and will come to disgrace. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#027">Proverbs 19:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">pro 19:27</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is the wisdom of young men to dread hearing such talk as puts loose and evil principles into the mind. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028">Proverbs 19:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">pro 19:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those are the worst of sinners, who are glad of an opportunity to sin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#029">Proverbs 19:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">pro 19:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The unbelief of man shall not make God's threatenings of no effect. Christ himself, when bearing sins not his own, was not spared. Justice and judgment took hold of our blessed Surety; and will God spare obstinate sinners?
