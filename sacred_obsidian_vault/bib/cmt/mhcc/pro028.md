 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 28:1</a></font></span></p>

 <p>If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">pro 28:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pro 28:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">pro 28:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#010">Proverbs 28:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 28:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#011">Proverbs 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">pro 28:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#012">Proverbs 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">pro 28:12</a></font></span></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 28:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014">Proverbs 28:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">pro 28:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015">Proverbs 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pro 28:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#016">Proverbs 28:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">pro 28:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#017">Proverbs 28:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pro 28:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">pro 28:18</a></font></span></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">pro 28:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those who are diligent, take the way to live comfortably. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#020">Proverbs 28:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">pro 28:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The true way to be happy, is to be holy and honest; not to raise an estate suddenly, without regard to right or wrong. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021">Proverbs 28:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 28:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Judgment is perverted, when any thing but pure right is considered. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022">Proverbs 28:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pro 28:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He that hastens to be rich, never seriously thinks how quickly God may take his wealth from him, and leave him in poverty. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#023">Proverbs 28:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">pro 28:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Upon reflection, most will have a better opinion of a faithful reprover than of a soothing flatterer. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#024">Proverbs 28:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">pro 28:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Here is the wickedness of those who think it no sin to rob their parents, by wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and running into debt. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#025">Proverbs 28:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">pro 28:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Those make themselves always easy, that live in continual dependence upon God and his grace, and live by faith. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#026">Proverbs 28:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">pro 28:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A fool trusts to his own strength, merit, and righteousness. And trusts to his own heart, which is not only deceitful above all things, but which has often deceived him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#027">Proverbs 28:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">pro 28:27</a></font></span></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">pro 28:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>When power is put into the hands of the wicked, wise men decline public business. If the reader will go diligently over this and the other chapters, in many places where at first he may suppose there is least of Christ, still he will find what will lead to him.
