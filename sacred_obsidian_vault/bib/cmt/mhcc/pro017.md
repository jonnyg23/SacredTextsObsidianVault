 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pro 17:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pro 17:15</a></font></span></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">pro 17:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017">Proverbs 17:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pro 17:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment.

 <p>If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020">Proverbs 17:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">pro 17:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021">Proverbs 17:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 17:21</a></font></span></p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022">Proverbs 17:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pro 17:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023">Proverbs 17:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">pro 17:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024">Proverbs 17:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">pro 17:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025">Proverbs 17:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">pro 17:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026">Proverbs 17:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">pro 17:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#027">Proverbs 17:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">pro 17:27</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.
