 <p>It is a debt we owe to faithful ministers, to remember our guides, who have spoken to us the word of God. It is good to know what our godly predecessors were, that we may learn what we should be. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027">Nehemiah 12:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">neh 12:27</a></font></span></p>
 <p>All our cities, all our houses, must have holiness to the Lord written upon them. The believer should undertake nothing which he does not dedicate to the Lord. We are concerned to cleanse our hands, and purify our hearts, when any work for God is to pass through them. Those that would be employed to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and set themselves apart for God. To those who are sanctified, all their creature-comforts and enjoyments are made holy. The people greatly rejoiced. All that share in public mercies, ought to join in public thanksgivings. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044">Nehemiah 12:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">neh 12:44</a></font></span></p>
 <p>When the solemnities of a thanksgiving day leave such impressions on ministers and people, that both are more careful and cheerful in doing their duty, they are indeed acceptable to the Lord, and turn to good account. And whatever we do, must be purified by the blood of sprinkling, and by the grace of the Holy Spirit, or it cannot be acceptable to God.
