 <p>This fruit of sin we should pray against above any thing; Cast me not away from thy presence, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011">Psa 51:11</a>. None are cast out of God's presence but those who by sin have first thrown themselves out. Zedekiah's flight was in vain, for there is no escaping the judgments of God; they come upon the sinner, and overtake him, let him flee where he will.

 <p>The Chaldean army made woful havoc. But nothing is so particularly related here, as the carrying away of the articles in the temple. The remembrance of their beauty and value shows us the more the evil of sin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024">Jeremiah 52:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">jer 52:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The leaders of the Jews caused them to err; but now they are, in particular, made monuments of Divine justice. Here is an account of two earlier captivities. This people often were wonders both of judgment and mercy. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031">Jeremiah 52:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">jer 52:31</a></font></span></p>
 <p>See this history of king Jehoiachin in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027">Kg2 25:27-30</a>. Those under oppression will find it is not in vain for them to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Our times are in God's hand, for the hearts of all we have to deal with are so. May we be enabled, more and more, to rest on the Rock of Ages, and to look forward with holy faith to that hour, when the Lord will bring again Zion, and overthrow all the enemies of the church.
