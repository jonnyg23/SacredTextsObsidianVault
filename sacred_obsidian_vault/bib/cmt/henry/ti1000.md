 <p>An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy
 </p><p>Hitherto Paul's epistles were directed to churches; now follow some to particular persons: two to Timothy, one to Titus, and another to Philemon - all three ministers. Timothy and Titus were evangelists, an inferior order to the apostles, as appears by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011">Eph 4:11</a>, Some prophets, some apostles, some evangelists. Their commission and work was much the same with that of the apostles, to plant churches, and water the churches that were planted; and accordingly they were itinerants, as we find Timothy was. Timothy was first converted by Paul, and therefore he calls him his own son in the faith: we read of his conversion, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Act 16:3</a>.
 </p><p>The scope of these two epistles is to direct Timothy how to discharge his duty as an evangelist at Ephesus, where he now was, and where Paul ordered him for some time to reside, to perfect the good work which he had begun there. As for the ordinary pastoral charge of that church, he had very solemnly committed it to the presbytery, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028">Act 20:28</a>, where he charges the presbyters to feed the flock of God, which he had purchased with his own blood.
