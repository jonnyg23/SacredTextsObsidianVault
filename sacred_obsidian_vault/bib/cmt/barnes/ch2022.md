 <p>For "42" read "22" (see the marginal reference). Ahaziah's father, Jehoram, was but 40 when be died <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020">Ch2 21:20</a>.

 <p>The destruction of Ahaziah was of God - i. e. his untimely end was a judgment upon him for his idolatry. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009">2 Chronicles 22:9</a></p>

 <p>Compare the marginal reference. Ahaziah after remaining a while at Megiddo, removed to Samaria, where his wounds could be better cared for and concealment might be easier; Jehu's emissaries discovered him there; they took him to Jehu, who happened at the time to be at Megiddo; and then and there Jehu put him to death. The narrative here is therefore supplementary to that of 2 Kings, and finds its proper place between the clause," He fled to Megiddo," and the words "and died there."
 </p><p>And when they had slain him, they buried him - Jehu's emissaries killed him but allowed his servants to bury him (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#028">Kg2 9:28</a>).
 </p><p>No power ... - As Ahaziah was but twenty-three at his death (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002">Ch2 22:2</a> note), he had no grown-up son to take the crown.
