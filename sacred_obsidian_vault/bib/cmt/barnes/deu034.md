 <p>Dan - This can hardly be the Dan (Dan-Laish) of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027">Jdg 18:27</a> ff, which was not in Gilead. It is probably a town of this name which stood in the north of Peraea; perhaps the same as Dan-jaan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#006">Sa2 24:6</a>; and the Dan of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014">Gen 14:14</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003">Deuteronomy 34:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">deu 34:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Unto Zoar - Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022">Gen 19:22</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#004">Deuteronomy 34:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">deu 34:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I have caused thee to see it - The sight thus afforded to Moses, like that of "all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#005">Luk 4:5</a>, was no doubt supernatural. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005">Deuteronomy 34:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">deu 34:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>According to the word of the Lord - It denotes that Moses died, not because his vital powers were exhausted, but by the sentence of God, and as a punishment for his sin. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051">Deu 32:51</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006">Deuteronomy 34:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 34:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>No man knoweth of his sepulchre - Hardly, lest the grave of Moses should become an object of superstitious honor, because the Jews were not prone to this particular fore of error. Bearing in mind the appearance of Moses at the Transfiguration <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001">Mat 17:1-10</a>, and what is said by Jude <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009">Jde 1:9</a>, we may conjecture that Moses after death passed into the same state with Enoch and Elijah; and that his grave could not be found because he was shortly translated (transported) from it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009">Deuteronomy 34:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 34:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Spirit of wisdom - The practical wisdom of the ruler is especially meant. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010">Deuteronomy 34:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 34:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>There arose not a prophet since in Israel - Words like these can only have been written some time, but not necessarily a long time, after the death of Moses. They refer more particularly to the wonders performed by the hand of Moses at the exodus and in the desert; and do but re-echo the declaration of God Himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006">Num 12:6</a> ff). They may naturally enough be attributed to one of Moses' successors, writing perhaps soon after the settlement of the people in Canaan.
