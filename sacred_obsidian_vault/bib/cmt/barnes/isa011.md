 <p>This chapter Isa. 11 is connected with the preceding as part of the same general prophecy. In that, the prophet bad described the invasion of Sennacherib, and had given the assurance that Jerusalem should be safe, notwithstanding the threatened invasion. The general design of that prophecy was "to console the people with the assurance of their deliverance from impending calamity." But it was a general principle with the Hebrew prophets, and particularly with Isaiah, when "any" event tending to console the people, or to excite the nation's gratitude, occurred, to east the eye forward to that great future deliverance which they anticipated under the Messiah; see the Introduction, Section 7, (3.) The contemplation of "present" objects dies away; the mind fixes more intently on the glories of the Messiah's reign; the prophetic vision ranges over the beauties of his person, and the glories of his kingdom, until the prophet seems to have forgotten the subject with which he commenced.
 </p><p>This was perfectly natural. It was by an obvious law of association in the mind, by which the mention of deliverance, in any form, however humble, would suggest that great deliverance on which the eye of every Jew would rest. It hence follows, that wherever the prophet begins, he usually ends with a glowing description of the reign of the Messiah. However far from this central object of revealed religion he may commenee, yet there is a tendency everywhere "to it" in the prophetic writings; and the moment that, by any law of association, this object is suggested, or the eye catches a glimpse of it, the former object sinks out of view, and the person and reign of the Messiah becomes the sole theme of the prophetic description. This is the case here. Isaiah had commenced the prophecy with an account of the invasion of Sennacherib; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005">Isa 10:5</a>, ... He had described the deliverance from that danger; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033">Isa 10:33-34</a>. The mention of this deliverance directs his thoughts to that far greater deliverance which would take place under the Messiah; and immediately Isa. 11 he commences a glowing description of his coming and his reign. The "language" with which he commenced the prophecy, is retained; the illustrations are drawn from the subject "before" under consideration; but the description pertains to the glories of the reign of the Messiah. The proof of this will appear in the note at particular passages in the chapter. Its general design is, to console the people by the prospect of a great future deliverance under the Messiah, and by a prospect of the glosses of his reign. He describes,
 </p><p>(i) The certainty that he would come, and his character; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1-5</a>.
 </p><p>(ii) The peace and prosperity which would follow from his advent; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006">Isa 11:6-9</a>.
 </p><p>(iii) The fact that, the Gentiles would he called to partake of the privileges of his reign; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>.
 </p><p>(iv) The restoration of the exiles to their native land under his reign; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11-12</a>.
 </p><p>(v) The fact, that his reign would put a period to dissensions and strifes between the contending nations of the Jews; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013">Isa 11:13</a>; and
 </p><p>(vi) The universal prevalence of his religion, and the deliverance of his people; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014">Isa 11:14-16</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isaiah 11:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 11:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And there shall come forth a rod - In the previous chapter, the prophet had represented the Assyrian monarch and his army under the image of a dense and flourishing forest, with all its glory and grandeur. In opposition to this, he describes the illustrious personage who is the subject of this chapter, under the image of a slender twig or shoot, sprouting up from the root of a decayed and fallen tree. Between the Assyrian, therefore, and the person who is the subject of this chapter, there is a most striking and beautiful contrast. The one was at first magnificent - like a vast spreading forest - yet should soon fall and decay; the other was the little sprout of a decayed tree, which should yet rise, expand and flourish.
 </p><p>A rod - (חטר  choṭı̂r). This word occurs in but one other place; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#003">Pro 14:3</a> : 'In the mouth of the foolish is a "rod" of pride.' Here it means, evidently, a branch, a twig, a shoot, such as starts up from the roots of a decayed tree, and is synonymous with the word rendered "branch" (צמח  tsemach) in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002">Isa 4:2</a>; see the Note on that place.
 </p><p>Out of the stem - (מגזע  mı̂geza‛). This word occurs but three times in the Old Testament; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#008">Job 14:8</a>; where it is rendered "stock:"
 </p><p>Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
 </p><p>And the stock thereof die in the ground;
 </p><p>And in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#024">Isa 40:24</a> : 'Yea, their "stock" shall not take root in the earth.' It means, therefore, the stock or stump of a tree that has been cut down - a stock, however, which may not be quite dead, but where it may send up a branch or shoot from its roots. It is beautifully applied to an ancient family that is fallen into decay, yet where there may be a descendant that shall rise and flourish; as a tree may fall and decay, but still there may be vitality in the root, and it shall send up a tender germ or sprout.
 </p><p>Of Jesse - The father of David. It means, that he who is here spoken of should be of the family of Jesse, or David. Though Jesse had died, and though the ancient family of David would fall into decay, yet there would arise from that family an illustrious descendant. The beauty of this description is apparent, if we bear in recollection that, when the Messiah was born, the ancient and much honored family of David had fallen into decay; that the mother of Jesus, though pertaining to that family, was poor, obscure, and unknown; and that, to all appearance, the glory of the family had departed. Yet from that, as from a long-decayed root in the ground, he should spring who would restore the family to more than its ancient glory, and shed additional luster on the honored name of Jesse.
 </p><p>And a branch - (נצר  nêtser). A twig, branch, or shoot; a slip, scion, or young sucker of a tree, that is selected for transplanting, and that requires to be watched with special care. The word occurs but four times; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021">Isa 60:21</a> : 'They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019">Isa 14:19</a> : 'But thou art cast out of thy grave as an abominable branch;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#007">Dan 11:7</a>. The word rendered branch in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jer 33:15</a>, is a different word in the original (צמח  tsemach), though meaning substantially the same thing. The word "branch" is also used by our translators, in rendering several other Hebrew words; "see" Taylor's "Concordance." Here the word is synonymous with that which is rendered "rod" in the previous part of the verse - a shoot, or twig, from the root of a decayed tree.
 </p><p>Out of his roots - As a shoot starts up from the roots of a decayed tree. The Septuagint renders this, 'And a flower (ἄνθος  anthos) shall arise from the root.' The Chaldee, 'And a king shall proceed from the sons of Jesse, and the Messiah from his sons' sons shall arise;' showing conclusively that the ancient Jews referred this to the Messiah.
 </p><p>That this verse, and the subsequent parts of the chapter, refer to the Messiah, may be argued from the following considerations:
 </p><p>(1) The fact that it is expressly applied to him in the New Testament. Thus Paul, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012">Rom 15:12</a>, quotes the tenth verse of this chapter as expressly applicable to the times of the Messiah.
 </p><p>(2) The Chaldee Paraphrase shows, that this was the sense which the ancient Jews put upon the passage. That paraphrase is of authority, only to show that this was the sense which appeared to be the true one by the ancient interpreters.
 </p><p>(3) The description in the chapter is not applicable to any other personage than the Messiah. Grotius supposes that the passage refers to Hezekiah; though, 'in a more sublime sense,' to the Messiah. Others have referred it to Zerubbabel. But none of the things here related apply to either, except the fact that they had a descent from the family of Jesse; for neither of those families had fallen into the decay which the prophet here describes.
 </p><p>(4) The peace, prosperity, harmony and order, referred to in the subsequent portions of the chapter, are not descriptive of any portion of the reign of Hezekiah.
 </p><p>(5) The terms and dcscriptions here accord with other portions of the Scriptures, as applicable to the Messiah. Thus Jeremiah <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jer 33:15</a> describes the Messiah under the similitude of a "branch, a germ or shoot - using, indeed, a different Hebrew word, but retaining the same idea and image; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</a>. It accords also with the description by Isaiah of the same personage in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002">Isa 4:2</a>; see the note on the place.
 </p><p>(6) I may add, that nearly all commentators have referred this to the Messiah; and, perhaps, it would not be possible to find greater unanimity in regard to the interpretation of any passage of Scripture than on this. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002">Isaiah 11:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 11:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And the Spirit of the Lord - The Spirit of Yahweh. Chaldee, 'And there shall rest upon him the spirit of prophecy from before Yahweh.' In the previous verse, the prophet had announced his origin and his birth. In this, he proceeds to describe his extraordinary endowments, as eminently holy, pure, and wise. There can be no doubt that reference is here had to the Holy Spirit, the third person of the sacred Trinity, as descending upon him in the fullness of his influences, and producing in him perfect wisdom, knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. The Spirit of Yahweh shall rest upon him - a Spirit producing wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, etc. All these are lit the Scriptures traced to the agency of the Holy Spirit; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008">Co1 12:8-11</a>. The meaning here is, that the Messiah should be endowed with these eminent prophetic gifts and qualifications for his ministry by the agency of the Holy Spirit. It was by that Spirit that the prophets had been inspired (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021">Pe2 1:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">Ti2 3:16</a>); and as the Messiah was to be a prophet <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015">Deu 18:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018">Deu 18:18</a>, there was a fitness that he should be endowed in the same manner. If it be asked how one, who was divine in his own nature, could be thus endowed by the aid of the Spirit, the answer is, that he was also to be a man descended from the honored line of David, and that as a man he might be furnished for his work by the agency of the Holy Spirit. His human nature was kept pure; his mind was made eminently wise; his heart always retained the fear and love of God, and there is no absurdity in supposing that these extraordinary endowments were to be traced to God. That he was thus under the influence of the Holy Spirit, is abundantly taught in the New Testament. Thus, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016">Mat 3:16</a>, the Holy Spirit is represented as descending on him at his baptism, In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034">Joh 3:34</a>, it is said, 'For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God, for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him;' compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019">Col 1:19</a>.
 </p><p>Shall rest upon him - That is, shall descend on him, and remain with him. It shall not merely come upon him, but shall attend him permanently; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025">Num 11:25-26</a>.
 </p><p>The spirit of wisdom - The spirit producing wisdom, or making him wise. Wisdom consists in the choice of the best means to secure the best ends. This attribute is often given to the Messiah in the New Testament, and was always evinced by him; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017">Eph 1:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</a> : 'In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.'
 </p><p>And understanding - The difference between the words here rendered wisdom and understanding is, that the former denotes wisdom properly; and the latter, that judgment resulting from wisdom, by which we distinguish things, or decide on their character.
 </p><p>The spirit of counsel - That by which be shall be qualified to "give" counsel or advice; the qualification of a public instructor and guide; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>.
 </p><p>And might - Strength, vigor, energy; that strength of heart and purpose which will enable a man to meet difficulties, to encounter dangers, to be bold, open, and fearless in the discharge of his duties. It is not necessary to remark, that this characteristic was found in an eminent degree in the Lord Jesus Christ.
 </p><p>Of knowledge - That is, the knowledge of the attributes and plans of Yahweh; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027">Mat 11:27</a> : 'Neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son.' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a> : 'No man hath seen God at I any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020">Jo1 5:20</a>.
 </p><p>And of the fear of the Lord - The fear of Yahweh is often used to denote piety in general, as consisting in a reverence for the divine commands, and a dread of offending him; "that is," a desire to please him, which is piety; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009">Psa 19:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010">Psa 111:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007">Pro 1:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013">Pro 3:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#033">Pro 15:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#023">Pro 19:23</a>. That this characteristic was found eminently in the Lord Jesus, it is not necessary to attempt to prove. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003">Isaiah 11:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 11:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And shall make him of quick understanding - (והריחו  vahărı̂ychô) The Septuagint renders this, 'And the spirit of the fear of God shall fill him.' The Chaldee, 'And the Lord shall draw him near to him in his fear.' The Syriac, 'And he shall be resplendent (like the sun, or the stars) in the fear of the Lord.' The Hebrew word used here is probably derived from ריח  rêyach, used only in Hiphil, "to smell;" and is kindred with רוח  rûach, "wind, breath," for fragrant substances "breathe out" an odor. - "Gesenius." It then denotes "to take delight in smelling" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038">Exo 30:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031">Lev 26:31</a>; and thence, by an easy transition, to take delight in anything; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021">Amo 5:21</a>. The reason is, that the objects of smell are usually pleasant and agreeable; and especially such as were the aromatics used in public worship. The sense here is, probably, that he would take pleasure in the fear of Yahweh, that is, in piety, and in devoting himself to his service. The interpretation given in our translation, is that given by many expositors; though that above suggested is probably the correct one. The word is used to denote "pleasure" in a thing; it is not used anywhere, it is believed, to denote a quick understanding; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#021">Exo 5:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018">Phi 4:18</a>. The idea which is conveyed by our translators is, probably, derived from "the discernment of the quality" of objects by an acute sense of smell, and hence, they interpreted the word to denote an acute discrimination of any objects.
 </p><p>And he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes - He sha 1 not judge of things by their external appearance. or with partiality. This is language which is applicable to a magistrate, and is spoken of the Messiah as the descendant of David, and as sitting on his throne as a ruler of his people. He who judges 'after the sight of his eyes,' does it according to external appearances, showing favor to rank, to the rich, and the great; or judging as things "appear" without a close and careful inquiry into their true nature and bearings; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024">Joh 7:24</a> : 'Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#016">Deu 1:16-17</a>.
 </p><p>Neither reprove - יוכיח  yôkiyach. This word means "to show, to prove; to correct, reprove, convince; to reproach, or censure; to punish; to judge, decide, etc." Here it is evidently used as synonymous with 'shall he judge' in the former part of the parallelism - retaining the idea of a just judge, who decides not according to the hearing of the ears, but according to justice.
 </p><p>After the hearing of his ears - Not by plausible statements, and ingenious defenses, but by weighing evidence, and by an impartial examination of the true merits of the case. This belonged to the Lord Jesus, because,
 </p><p>(1) He was never influenced by any undue regard to rank, honor, or office. His opinions were always impartial; his judgments without bias or favoritism.
 </p><p>(2) He was able to discern the true merits of every case. He knew what was in man, saw the true state of the heart, and, therefore, was not deceived or imposed upon as human judges are; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024">Joh 2:24-25</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028">Rev 2:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064">Joh 6:64</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isaiah 11:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 11:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Shall he judge the poor - That is, he shall see that impartial justice is done them; he shall not take part with the rich against the poor, but shall show that he is the friend of justice. This is the quality of a just and upright magistrate, and this character the Lord Jesus everywhere evinced. He chose his disciples from among the poor; he condescended to be their companion and friend; he provided for their needs; and he pronounced their condition blessed; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003">Mat 5:3</a>. There may be a reference here to the poor in spirit - the humble, the penitent; but the main idea is, that he would not be influenced by any undue regard for the higher ranks of life, but would be the friend and patron of the poor.
 </p><p>And reprove - הוכיח  hô̂kiyach. And judge, decide, or argue for; that is, he shall be their friend and their impartial judge; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003">Isa 11:3</a>.
 </p><p>With equity - With uprightness, or uncorrupted integrity.
 </p><p>For the meek of the earth - ענוי־ארץ  ‛anevēy 'ārets. For the humble, the lower class; referring to those who were usually passed by, or oppressed by those in power.
 </p><p>And he shall smite the earth - By the "earth" here, or the land, is meant evidently "the wicked," as the following member of the parallelism shows. Perhaps it is intended to be implied, that the earth, when he should come, would be eminently depraved; which was the fact. The characteristic here is that of an upright judge or prince, who would punish the wicked. To "smite" the earth, or the wicked, is expressive of punishment; and this characteristic is elsewhere attributed to the Messiah; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009">Psa 2:9-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027">Rev 2:27</a>. The trait is that of a just, upright, impartial exercise of power - such as would be manifested in the defense of the poor and the innocent, and in the punishment of the proud and the guilty.
 </p><p>With the rod of his mouth - The word שׁבט  shêbet rendered here 'rod,' denotes properly a stick, or staff; a rod for chastisement or correction <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013">Pro 10:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024">Pro 13:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009">Job 21:9</a>; the staff, or scepter of a ruler - as an emblem of office; a measuring rod; a spear, etc.; Note, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005">Isa 10:5</a>. It is not elsewhere applied to the mouth, though it is often used in other connections. It means that which goes out of the mouth - a word command threatening decision; and it is implied that it would go forth to pronounce sentence of condemnation, and to punish. His word would be so just, impartial, and authoritative, that the effect would be to overwhelm the wicked. In a sense similar to this, Christ is said to have been seen by John, when 'out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016">Rev 1:16</a>; that is, his commands and decisions were so authoritative, and so certain in their execution, as to be like a sharp sword; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012">Heb 4:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002">Isa 49:2</a> : 'And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword.' The discriminating preaching, the pungent discourses, the authoritative commands of the Lord Jesus, when on earth, showed, and his judicial decisions in the day of judment will show, the manner of the fulfillment of the prediction.
 </p><p>And with the breath of his lips - This is synonymous with the previous member of the parallelism. 'The breath of his lips' means that which goes forth from his lips - his doctrines, his commands, his decisions.
 </p><p>Shall he slay the wicked - That is, he shall condemn the wicked; or, he shall sentence them to punishment. This is descriptive of a prince or ruler, who by his commands and decisions effectually subdues and punishes the wicked; that is, he does justice to all. Grotius interprets this, 'by his prayers,' referring it to Hezekiah, and to the influence of his prayers in destroying the Assyrians. The Chaldee Paraphrast translates it, 'And by the word of his lips he shall slay the impious Armillus.' By "Armillus," the Jews mean the last great enemy of their nation, who would come after Gog and Magog and wage furious wars, and who would slay the Messiah Ben Ephraim, whom the Jews expect, but who would be himself slain by the rod of the Messiah Ben David, or the son of David. - "Castell." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005">Isaiah 11:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 11:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And righteousness shall be the gridle of his loins - The sense of this verse is plain. He will always exhibit himself as a just and faithful king. "The girdle of the loins" refers to the cincture, or band, with which the ancients girded themselves. A part of their dress consisted of an outward, loose, flowing robe. This robe it was necessary to gird up, or to confine close to the body in active labor, or in running; and the meaning of the figure used here is, probably, that the virtues of righteousness and justice would adhere to him as closely and inseparably as the garment does to the body to which it was bound. The figure of representing the virtues as clothing, or describing them as parts of dress with which we are invested, is common in the Scriptures:
 </p><p>I put on righteousness, and it clothes me;
 </p><p>My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014">Job 29:14</a>.
 </p><p>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
 </p><p>My soul shall be joyful in my God;
 </p><p>For he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
 </p><p>He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness,
 </p><p>As a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments,
 </p><p>And as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010">Isa 61:10</a>.
 </p><p>Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008">Rev 19:8</a>, and Paul's beautiful description in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013">Eph 6:13-17</a>. In like manner, vice and wickedness are sometimes represented as so closely adhering to a man as to be a part of his very clothing; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#018">Psa 109:18-19</a> :
 </p><p>He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a garment.
 </p><p>Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him,
 </p><p>And for a girdle, wherewith he is girded continually.
 </p><p>The Chaldee renders this, 'And the just shall be round about him on every side - סחור סחור sehôr sehôr - and the servants of truth shall come near to him.' The idea is, that he shall be distinguished for justice and truth, and that a zeal for these shall make him strong and active in executing the purposes of his reign. This closes the description of the "personal" qualities of the Messiah. The account of the effects of his reign follows in the subsequent verses.

 <p>The wolf also - In this, and the following verses, the prophet describes the effect of his reign in producing peace and tranquility on the earth. The description is highly poetical, and is one that is common in ancient writings in describing a golden age. The two leading ideas are those of "peace" and "security." The figure is taken from the condition of animals of all descriptions living in a state of harmony, where those which are by nature defenseless, and which are usually made the prey of the strong, are suffered to live in security. By nature the wolf preys upon the lamb, and the leopard upon the kid, and the adder is venomous, and the bear, and the cow, and the lion, and the ox, cannot live together. But if a state of things should arise, where all this hostility would cease; where the wild animals would lay aside their ferocity, and where the feeble and the gentle would be safe; where the adder would cease to be venomous, and where all would be so mild and harmless that a little child would be safe, and could lead even the most ferocious animals, that state would represent the reign of the Messiah. Under his dominion, such a change would be produced as that those who were by nature violent, severe, and oppressive; those whose disposition is illustrated by the ferocious and bloodthirsty propensities of the lion and the leopard, and by the poison of the adder, would be changed and subdued, and would be disposed to live in peace and harmony with others. This is the "general" idea of the passage. We are not to cut the interpretation to the quick, and to press the expressions to know what particular class of people are represented by the lion, the bear, or the adder. The "general" image that is before the prophet's mind is that of peace and safety, "such as that would be" if a change were to be produced in wild animals, making them tame, and peaceful, and harmless.
 </p><p>This description of a golden age is one that is common in Oriental writers, where the wild beasts are represented as growing tame; where serpents are harmless; and where all is plenty, peace, and happiness. Thus Jones, in his commentary on Asiatic poetry, quotes from an Arabic poet, "Ibn Onein," p. 380:
 </p><p>Justitia, a qua mansuetus fit lupus fame astrictus,
 </p><p>Esuriens, licet hinnulum candidurn videat - 
 </p><p>'Justice, by which the ravening wolf, driven by hunger, becomes tame, although he sees a white kid.' Thus, also, Ferdusi, a Persian poet:
 </p><p>Rerum Dominus, Mahmud, rex. potens,
 </p><p>Ad cujus aquam potum veniunt simul agnus et lupus - 
 </p><p>'Mahmud, mighty king, lord of events, to whose fountain the lamb and the wolf come to drink.' Thus Virgil, Eclogue iv. 21:
 </p><p>Ipsae lactae domum referent distenta capellae
 </p><p>Ubera; nec magnos metuent armenta leones - 
 </p><p>Home their full udders, goats, unurged shall bear,
 </p><p>Nor shall the herd the lordly lion fear.
 </p><p>And immediately after:
 </p><p>Occidet et serpens, et fallax herba veneni
 </p><p>Occidet - 
 </p><p>The snake, and poison's treacherous weed shall die.
 </p><p>Wrangham.
 </p><p>Again, Eclogue, v. 60:
 </p><p>Nec lupus insidias pecori, nec retia cervis
 </p><p>Ulla dolum mediantur: amat bonus otia Daphnis.
 </p><p>So also Horace, "Epod." 16:53, 54:
 </p><p>Nec yespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile,
 </p><p>Nec intumescit alta viperis humus.
 </p><p>See also "Claudian," Lib. ii. v. 25ff; and Theocritus, Idyl xxiv. 84, as quoted by Gesenius and Rosenmuller.
 </p><p>These passages are beautiful, and highly poetic; but they do not equal the beauty of the prophet. There is an exquisite sweetness in the passage of Isaiah - in the picture which he has drawn - particularly in the introduction of the security of the young child, which does not occur in the quotations from the pagan poets.
 </p><p>That this passage is descriptive of the times of the Messiah, there can be no doubt. It has been a question, to what particular part of his reign the prophet has reference. Some have referred it to the time when he came, and to the influence of his gospel in mitigating the ferocity of his enemies, and ultimately disposing them to suffer Christens to live with them - the infuriated enemies of the cross, under the emblem of the wolf, the bear, the leopard, and the adder, becoming willing that the Christian, under the emblem of the lamb, and the kid, should live with them without molestation. This is the interpretation of Vitringa. Others have referred it to the Millennium - as descriptive of a state of happiness, peace, and universal security then. Others have referred it to the second coming of the Messiah, as descriptive of a time when it is supposed that he will reign personally on the earth, and when there shall be universal security and peace, and when the nature of animals shall be so far changed, that the ferocity of those which are wild and ravenous shall cease, and they shall become harmless to the defenseless. Without attempting to examine these opinions at length, we may, perhaps, express the sense of the passage by the following observations:
 </p><p>(1) The eye of the prophet is fixed upon the reign of the Messiah, not with reference to time, but with reference to the actual facts of that reign. He saw the scene pass before his mind in vision (see the Introduction, Section 7, 3: (4.) (5.), and it is not the nature of such descriptions to mark the "time," but the order, the passing aspect of the scene. "Under the reign of the Messiah," he saw that this would occur. Looking down distant times, as on a beautiful landscape, he perceived, under the mild reign of the Prince of peace, a state of things which would be well represented by the wolf dwelling with the lamb, the leopard crouching down with the kid, and a little child safe in their midst.
 </p><p>(2) It was, "in fact," partially fulfilled in the earliest times of the gospel, and has been everywhere. Under that gospel, the mad passions of men have been subdued; their wild ferocious nature has been changed; their love of conquest, and war, and blood taken away; and the change has been such as would be beautifully symbolized by the change of the disposition of the wolf and the leopard - suffering the innocent and the harmless to live with them in peace.
 </p><p>(3) The scene will not be fully realized until the reign of the Messiah shall be extended to all nations, and his gospel shall everywhere accomplish its full effects. The vision of Isaiah here has not yet received a full completion; nor will it until the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009">Isa 11:9</a>. The mind is, therefore, still directed onward. In future times, under the reign of the messiah, what is here described shall occur - a state of security, and peace, and happiness. Isaiah saw that splendid vision, as in a picture, pass before the mind; the wars, and persecutions, and trials of the Messiah's kingdom were, for a time at least, thrown into the back ground, or not represented, and, in that future time, he saw what is here represented. It has been partially fulfilled in all the changes which the Messiah's reign has made in the natural ferocity and cruelty of men; in all the peace which at any time the church has been permitted to enjoy; in all the revolutions promoting human safety, welfare, and happiness, which Christianity has produced. It is to receive the complete fulfillment - τὸ ἀποτελέσμα  to spotelesma - only in that future time when the gospel shall be everywhere established on the earth. The essential thing, therefore, in the prophecy, is the representation of the peace, safety, and harmony which shall take place under the Messiah. So to speak, it was a taking out, and causing to pass before the mind of the prophet, all the circumstances of harmony, order, and love in his reign - as, in a beautiful panoramic view of a landscape, the beauties of the whole scene may be made to pass before the mind; the circumstances that might even then, if surveyed closely, give pain, were hid from the view, or lost in the loveliness of the whole scene.
 </p><p>(4) That it does not refer to any literal change in the nature of animals, so that the ferocity of the untamed shall be wholly laid aside, the disposition to prey on one another wholly cease, and the poisonous nature of the adder be destroyed, seems to me to be evident:
 </p><p>(a) Because the whole description has a highly figurative and poetical cast.
 </p><p>(b) Because such figurative expressions are common in all poetry, and especially among the Orientals.
 </p><p>(c) Because it does not appear how the gospel has any tendency to change the nature of the lion, the bear, or the serpent. It acts on men, not on brutes; on human hearts, not on the organization of wild animals.
 </p><p>(d) Because such a state of things could not occur without a perpetual miracle, changing the physical nature of the whole animal creation, The lion, the wolf, the panther, are made to live on flesh. The whole organization of their teeth and digestive powers is adapted to this, and this alone. To fit them to live on vegetable food, would require a change in their whole structure, and confound all the doctrines of natural history. The adder is poisonous, and nothing but a miracle would prevent the poisonous secretion, and make his bite innocuous. But where is a promise of any such coutinued miracle as shall change the whole structure of the animal creation, and make the physical world different from what it is? It is indeed probable that wild animals and venomous serpents will wholly retire before the progress of civilization and Christianity, and that the earth may be inhabited everywhere with safety - for such is the tendency of the advance of civilization - but this is a very different thing from a change in the physical nature of the animal creation.
 </p><p>The fair interpretation of this passage is, therefore, that revolutions will be produced in the wild and evil passions of men - the only thing with which the gospel has to do as great "as if" a change were produced in, the animal creation, and the most ferocious and the most helpless should dwell together. The wolf (זאב  ze'êb) is a well-known animal, so called from his yellow or golden color. The Hebrew name is formed by changing the Hebrew letter ה  (h) in the word זהב  zâhâb, "gold," to the Hebrew letter א - Bochart. The wolf, in the Scriptures, is described as ravenous, fierce, cruel; and is the emblem of that which is wild, ferocious, and savage among human beings; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027">Gen 49:27</a> : 'Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027">Eze 22:27</a> : 'Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015">Mat 7:15</a> : 'Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012">Joh 10:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016">Mat 10:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003">Luk 10:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029">Act 20:29</a>. The wolf is described as sanguinary and bloody <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027">Eze 22:27</a>, and as taking its prey by night, and as therefore particularly an object of dread; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jer 5:6</a> : 'A wolf of the evenings shall spoil them; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008">Hab 1:8</a> : 'Their horses are more fierce than the evening wolves;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003">Zep 3:3</a> : 'Her judges are evening wolves, they gnaw not the bones until tomorrow.' in the Scriptures, the wolf is constantly represented in contrast with the lamb; the one the emblem of ferocity, the other of gentleness and innocence; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016">Mat 10:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003">Luk 10:3</a>. The pagan poets also regard the wolf as an emblem of ferocity and cruelty:
 </p><p>Inde lupi cen
 </p><p>Raptores, atra in nebula quos improba ventris
 </p><p>Exegit caecos rabies, etc. - 
 </p><p>(Virg. AEn. ii. 355ff.)
 </p><p>As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,
 </p><p>Scour through the fields, nor fear the stormy night - 
 </p><p>Their whelps at home expect the promised food,
 </p><p>And long to temper their dry chaps in blood - 
 </p><p>So rushed we forth at once.
 </p><p>Dryden.
 </p><p>Cervi, luporum praeda rapacium.
 </p><p>Hor. Car. Lib. iv. Ode iv. 50.
 </p><p>See a full illustration of the nature and habits of the wolf in Boehart, "Hieroz." Part i. B. iii. ch. x. pp. 821-830. "Shall dwell." גר  ger. Shall sojourn, or abide. The word usually denotes a residence for a time only, away from home, not a permanent dwelling. The idea here is, that they shall remain peacefully together. The same image occurs in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025">Isa 65:25</a>, in another form: 'The wolf and the lamb shall feed together.'
 </p><p>The lamb - Everywhere the emblem of mildness, gentleness, and innocence; and, therefore, applied often to the people of God, as mild, inoffensive, and forbearing; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015">Joh 21:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003">Luk 10:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002">Isa 40:2</a>. It is very often applied, by way of eminence, to the Lord Jesus Christ; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032">Act 8:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007">Isa 2:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019">Pe1 1:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006">Rev 5:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008">Rev 5:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012">Rev 5:12-13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016">Rev 6:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009">Rev 7:9-10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014">Rev 7:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017">Rev 7:17</a>, "et al."
 </p><p>And the leopard - נמר  nâmêr. The leopard, a well-known wild beast, was regarded in Oriental countries as second in dignity only to the lion. The Arabic writers say, 'He is second in rank to the lion, and, as there is a natural hatred between them, victory is alternate between them.' Hence, in the Scriptures, the lion and the leopard are often joined together as animals of the same character and rank; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008">Sol 4:8</a> :
 </p><p>From the lions' den,
 </p><p>From the mountains of the leopards.
 </p><p>See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jer 5:6</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007">Hos 13:7</a> :
 </p><p>Therefore I will be unto them as a lion,
 </p><p>As a leopard by the way will I observe them.
 </p><p>The leopard is distinguished for his spots; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023">Jer 13:23</a> : 'Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?' it has small white eyes, wide jaws, sharp teeth, and is represented as extremely cruel to man. It was common in Palestine, and was an object of great dread. It lurked for its prey like the lion, and seized upon it suddenly <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jer 5:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007">Hos 13:7</a>, and was particularly distinguished for its velocity <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008">Hab 1:8</a>), and is often referred to in the classic writers as an emblem of fleetness. See "Bochart." The image used here by Isaiah, that 'the leopard should lie down with the kid,' as an emblem of peace and safety, occurs almost in the same form in the Sybilline oracles, Lib. iii:
 </p><p>παρδάλιές τ ̓ ἐριφοίς ἅμα βοσκήσονται, - 
 </p><p>parklies t' eriphois hama boskēsontai, - 
 </p><p>'Leopards shall feed together with kids.' "See" Bochart, "Hieroz." Part i. B. iii. ch. vii. pp. 786-791.
 </p><p>With the kid - The young of the goat; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#021">Gen 37:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#019">Lev 23:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029">Luk 15:29</a>. Like the lamb, it was an emblem of gentleness, mildness, and inoffensiveness.
 </p><p>And the calf - Another emblem of inoffensiveness and innocence.
 </p><p>And the young lion - The Hebrew word used here - כפיר  kephı̂yr - denotes one that is old enough to go abroad for prey. It is employed as emblematic of dangerous enemies <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002">Psa 34:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017">Psa 35:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007">Psa 58:7</a>; and also as emblematic of young heroes, or defenders of a state; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#015">Eze 38:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#012">Nah 2:12</a>.
 </p><p>And the fatling - The calf or other animal that was well fed, and that would be therefore particularly an object of desire to a wild beast. The beauty of the image is heightened, by the circumstance that now the ravenous beast would live with that which usually excites its keenest appetite, without attempting to injure it.
 </p><p>And a little child shall lead them - This is an especially beautiful image introduced into the picture of peace and prosperity. Naturally, the lion and the leopard are objects of dread to a young child. But here, the state of peace and safety is represented as not only so entire that the child might live with them in safety, but their natural ferocity is so far subdued and tamed, that they could be led by him at his will. The verisimilitude of the picture is increased by the circumstance, that these wild beasts may be so far tamed as to become subject to the will of a man, and even of a child. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#007">Isaiah 11:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 11:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And the cow and the bear shall feed - That is, together. Animals that by nature do not dwell together, where by nature the one would be the prey of the other, shall dwell together - animage of safety and peace.
 </p><p>And the lion shall eat straw like the ox - A representation of the change that will take place under the reign of the Messiah in the natural disposition of men, and in the aspect of society; as great as if the lion were to lose his natural appetite for blood, and to live on the usual food of the ox. This cannot be taken literally, for such an interpretation would suppose a change in the physical organization of the lion - of his appetites, his teeth, his digestive organs - a change which it would be absurd to suppose will ever exist. It would in fact make him a different being. And it is clear, therefore, that the whole passage is to be interpreted in "moral" sense, as denoting great and important changes in society, and in the hearts of men. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008">Isaiah 11:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 11:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And the sucking child - An emblem here of harmlessness and innocence. The change in the world, under the Messiah, shall be as great as if a sucking infant should be able to play unharmed with a venomous serpent.
 </p><p>Shall play - Shall delight himself (שׁעשׁע  shı̂‛ăsha‛) as children usually engage in their sports; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030">Pro 8:30-31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#024">Psa 119:24</a>.
 </p><p>On the hole of the asp - Over, or around the cavern, hole, or place of retreat of the asp. He shall play over that place as safely as if the nature of the asp was changed, and it had become innocuous. The Hebrew word rendered here "asp" (פתן  pethen) denotes the serpent usually called the asp, whose poison is of such rapid operation that it kills almost instantly: see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014">Job 20:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#016">Job 20:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004">Psa 58:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013">Psa 91:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#033">Deu 32:33</a>. The word occurs in no other places in the Old Testament. This serpent is small. It is found particularly in Egypt, though also in other places; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014">Job 20:14</a>. It is used here as the emblem of the more sudden, malignant, and violent passions; and the idea is, that under the Messiah a change would be performed in people of malignant and deadly passions as signal "as if" the asp or adder were to lose his venom, and become innocuous to a child.
 </p><p>And the weaned child - But still, a young and helpless child. The image is varied, but the same idea is retained.
 </p><p>Shall put his hand - That is, he shall do it safely, or uninjured.
 </p><p>On the cockatrice' den - Margin, 'Adder's.' The word rendered here "cockatrice" (צפעוני  tsı̂p‛ônı̂y) occurs only in the fellowing places: <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029">Isa 14:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008">Isa 11:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005">Isa 59:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#032">Pro 23:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017">Jer 8:17</a>. In all these places, it is rendered cockatrice, except in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#032">Pro 23:32</a>. The "cockatrice" was a fabulous kind of serpent, supposed to be hatched from the egg of a cock. The serpent here designated is, doubtless, a species of the "adder," more venomous, perhaps, than the פתן  pethen, but still belonging to the same species. Bochart ("Hieroz." P. ii. lib. iii. ch. ix.) supposes that the "basilisk" is intended - a species of serpent that, he says, was supposed to poison even with its breath. The general idea is the same here as above. It is in vain to attempt to spiritualize these expressions, and to show that they refer to certain individuals, or that the animals here designated refer to particular classes of the enemies of the gospel. It is a mere poetic description, denoting great peace and security; and all the changes in the mad, malignant, and envenomed passions of people, that may be necessary to produce and perpetuate that peace. Pope has versified this description in the following beautiful manner:
 </p><p>The lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead,
 </p><p>And boys, in flowery bands, the tigers lead.
 </p><p>The steer and lion at one crib shall meet,
 </p><p>And harmless serpents lick the pilgrim's feet.
 </p><p>The smiling infant in his hand shall take
 </p><p>The crested basilisk, and speckled snake;
 </p><p>Pleased, the green luster of the scales survey,
 </p><p>And, with their forked tongue, shall innocently play.
 </p><p>Messiah. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009">Isaiah 11:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 11:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>They shall not hurt - That is, those who are designated above under the emblems of the lion, the leopard, the bear, and the adder.
 </p><p>Nor destroy in all my holy mountain - Mount Zion; used here, as elsewhere, to denote the seat of his reign on the earth, or his church; the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008">Isa 1:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004">Isa 2:4</a>. The disposition of people, naturally ferocious and cruel, shall be changed so entirely, that the causes of strife and contention shall cease. They shall be disposed to do justice, and to promote each other's welfare everywhere.
 </p><p>For the earth - That is, in the times of the Messiah, It does not say that it shall be immediate under his reign, but under his reign this shall occur on the earth.
 </p><p>The knowledge of the Lord - This is put for piety, as the "fear" of the Lord often is. The earth shall be full of a correct understanding of the existence, perfections, plans, and claims of God; and shall be disposed to yield to those claims - thus producing universal peace.
 </p><p>As the waters cover the sea - That is, the depths or the bottom of the sea; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014">Hab 2:14</a>. The vast waters of the ocean cover all its depths, find their way into all the caverns, flow into all the recesses on the shore - and thus shall the knowledge of Yahweh spread like deep, flowing waters, until the earth shall be pervaded and covered with it. It is evident that a time is here spoken of which has not yet fully come, and the mind is still directed onward, as was that of the prophet, to a future period when this shall be accomplished. The prophecy has been indeed in part fulfilled. Wherever the gospel has spread, its effect has been just that which is predicted here. It has calmed and subdued the angry passions of people; changed their feelings and their conduct; disposed them to peace; and tended to mitigate national ferocity, to produce kindness to captives, and to those who had been oppressed. It has mitigated laws that were cruel and bloody; and has abolished customs, games, sports, and pastimes that were ferocious and savage. It has often changed the bitter persecutor, as it did Saul of Tarsus, to the mildness and gentleness of a lamb; and it has spread an influence over nations tending to produce humanity and benevolence. It has produced mildness, gentleness, and love, in the domestic circle; changed a the cruel and lordly husband to a companion and friend; and the character of the stern and inexorable father to one of paternal kindness and peace. Wherever it has spread "in truth" and not "in form merely," it has shed a mild, calming, and subduing influence over the passions, laws, and customs of people. But its effects have been but partially felt; and we are led, therefore, to look forward to future times, when the prophecy shall be entirely fulfilled, and the power of the gospel shall be felt in all nations. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isaiah 11:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 11:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And in that day - That future time when the reign of the Messiah shall be established; Note, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002">Isa 3:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001">Isa 4:1</a>. The prophet, having described the birth, and the personal characteristics of the great personage to whom he referred, together with the peaceful effects of his reign, proceeds to state the result of that reign in some other respects. The first is <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>, that the "Gentiles" would be brought under his reign; the second <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014">Isa 11:14</a>, that it would be attended with the restoration of the scattered people of Judea; and the third <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isa 11:15-16</a>, that it would be followed by the destruction of the enemies of the people of God.
 </p><p>There shall be a root of Jesse - There shall be a sprout, shoot, or scion of the ancient and decayed family of Jesse; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001">Isa 5:1</a>. Chaldee, 'There shall be a son of the sons of Jesse.' The word "root" here - שׁרשׁ  shoresh - is evidently used in the sense of a root that, is alive when the tree is dead; a root that sends up a shoot or sprout; and is thus applied to him who should proceed from the ancient and decayed family of Jesse; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002">Isa 53:2</a>. Thus in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005">Rev 5:5</a>, the Messiah is called 'the" root" of David,' and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16</a>, 'the root and the offspring of David.'
 </p><p>Which shall stand - There is reference here, doubtless, to the fact that military ensigns were sometimes raised on mountains or towers which were permanent, and which, therefore, could be rallying points to an arm or a people. The idea is, that the root of Jesse, that is, the Messiah, should be conspicuous, and that the nations should flee to him, and rally around him as a people do around a military standard. Thus the Saviour says <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032">Joh 12:32</a> : 'And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.'
 </p><p>For an ensign - For a standard, or a sign round which they shall rally.
 </p><p>Of the people - That is, as the parallelism shows, of the Gentiles.
 </p><p>To it shall the Gentiles seek - The pagan world shall look to it for safety and deliverance. In the Scriptures, the world is spoken of as divided into Jews and Gentiles. All who are not Jews come under this appellation. This is a distinct prophecy, that other nations than the Jews should be benefited by the work of the Messiah, and constitute a part of his kingdom. This fact is often referred to by Isaiah, and constitutes a very material feature in his prophecies; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006">Isa 42:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022">Isa 49:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003">Isa 54:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003">Isa 60:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005">Isa 60:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011">Isa 60:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016">Isa 60:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006">Isa 61:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009">Isa 61:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002">Isa 62:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012">Isa 66:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019">Isa 66:19</a>. The word "seek" here, is used in the sense of seeking as a Deliverer, or a Saviour: they shall apply to him for instruction, guidance, and salvation; or they shall apply to him as a nation looks to its deliverer to protect it; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019">Isa 8:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#003">Kg2 1:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001">Isa 65:1</a>.
 </p><p>And his rest - The rest, peace, and quietness, which he shall give. This evidently includes all the rest or peace which he shall impart to those who seek him. The word מנוחה  menûchâh sometimes denotes "a resting place," or a habitation <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033">Num 10:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010">Mic 2:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008">Psa 132:8</a>; but it also denotes "a state of rest, quietness;" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009">Rut 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#003">Jer 45:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002">Psa 23:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011">Psa 95:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009">Deu 12:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012">Isa 28:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001">Isa 46:1</a>. Here it evidently means the latter. It may refer,
 </p><p>(1) To the peace which he gives to the conscience of the awaened and troubled sinner <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28-30</a>; or
 </p><p>(2) To the prosperity and peace which his reign shall produce.
 </p><p>Shall be glorious - Hebrew, 'Shall be glory.' That is, shall be full of glory and honor. It shall be such as shall confer signal honor on his reign. The Chaldee understands this of his place of residence, his palace, or court. 'And the place of his abode shall be in glory.' The Vulgate renders it, 'and his sepulchre shall be glorious.'
 </p><p>'By his rest, we are not to understand his grave - or his death - or his Sabbath - or the rest he gives his people - but his place of rest, his residence. There is no need of supplying a preposition before glory, which is an abstract used for a concrete - glory, for glorious. The church, Christ's home, shall be glorious from his presence, and the accession of the Gentiles.' - (Alexander.) This is a beautiful rendering; it is, moreover, consistent with the letter and spirit of the passage. Some include both ideas. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isaiah 11:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 11:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And it shall come to pass - The prophet having, in the previous verse, stated the effect of the reign of the Messiah on the Gentile world, proceeds to state the result on the scattered Jews. Whether it is to be a literal re-collecting of the scattered tribes to the land of their fathers, has been a subject of debate, and is still so by expositors. We may be able to determine what is the correct general interpretation after the particular phrases have been examined.
 </p><p>In that day - That future time referred to in this whole prophecy. The word "day" is often used to denote a long time - or the time during which anything continues, as "the day" denotes all the hours until it is terminated by night. So "day" denotes the time of a man's life - 'his day;' or time in general; or the time when one shall be prominent, or be the principal object at that time. Thus it is applied to the time of the Messiah, as being the period of the world in which he will be the prominent or distinguished object; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056">Joh 8:56</a> : 'Abraham rejoiced to see my day;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024">Luk 17:24</a> : 'So shall the Son of man be in his day.' The expression here means, that somewhere in that future time, when the Messiah should appear, or when the world should be put under him as the Mediator, the event would take place which is here predicted. As the word 'day' includes "all" the time of the Messiah, or all his reign from his first to his second advent, it is not to be supposed that the event would take place when he was personally on earth. Isaiah saw it in vision, as "one" of the events which was to occur after the 'root of Jesse' should stand as an ensign to the nations.
 </p><p>That the Lord shall set his hand - That Yahweh shall undertake this, and accomplish it. To set the hand to anything is to undertake to perform it.
 </p><p>The second time - שׁנית  shênı̂yth. This word properly means, as it is here translated, the second time, implying that the prophet here speaks of a deliverance which would resemble, in some respects, a "former" deliverance or recovery. By the former recovery to which he here refers, he cannot mean the deliverance from Egypt under Moses, for at that time there was no recovery from scattered and distant nations. Besides, if "that" was the reference by the former deliverance, then that mentioned here as the 'second' deliverance would be that from the Babylonian captivity. But on the return from that captivity, there was not a collecting of the Jews from all the nations here specified. When the Jews were led back to Judea under Nehemiah, there is no record of their having been collected from 'Egypt,' or from 'Cush,' or from 'the islands of the sea.' It is evident, therefore, I think, that by the former deliverance to which the prophet here alludes - the deliverance which was to precede that designated here as the "second" - he refers to the return from the captivity of Babylon; and by the 'second,' to some still more future recovery that should take place under the administration of the Messiah. This is further confirmed from the fact that the whole scope of the prophecy points to that future period.
 </p><p>To recover - Hebrew, 'To possess,' or, to obtain possession of - לקנות  lı̂qenôth. This word properly means to obtain possession of by purchasing or buying anything. But it is also applied to any possession obtained of an object by power, labor, skill, or by delivering from bondage or captivity, and is thus synonymous with "redeem" or "deliver." Thus it is applied to the deliverance of the people from Egypt; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006">Deu 32:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016">Exo 15:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002">Psa 74:2</a>. It means here, that Yahweh would redeem, rescue, recover his people; but it does not specify the "mode" in which it would be done. Any mode - either by collecting and rescuing them from the regions into which they were scattered into one place, or by a "spiritual" turning to him, wherever they might be, would meet the force of this word. If in the lands where they were scattered, and where they had wandered away from the true God, they were converted, and should become again his people, the event would correspond with all that is meant by the word here.
 </p><p>They would "then" be purchased, possessed, or recovered to himself, by being delivered from their spiritual oppression. It is not necessary, therefore, to resort to the interpretation that they should, in the 'second' deliverance, be restored literally to the land of Canaan. Any argument for that doctrine from this passage must be drawn from the word here used - 'recover' - and that "that" idea is not necessarily involved in this word is abundantly manifest from its familiar use in the Old Testament. All that that word implies, is, that they should "be possessed" by God as his people; an idea which is fully met by the supposition that the scattered Jews everywhere will be converted to the Messiah, and thus become his true people. For this use of the word, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#010">Gen 25:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#022">Gen 47:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#030">Gen 49:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#013">Gen 50:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032">Jos 24:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#003">Sa2 12:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#024">Lev 27:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008">Neh 5:8</a>. In no place does it necessarily imply the idea of "collecting or restoring" a scattered people to their Own land.
 </p><p>The remnant of his people - That is, the remnant of the Jews, still called his people. In all the predictions respecting the calamities that should ever come upon them, the idea is "always" held out that the nation would not be wholly extinguished; but that, however great the national judgments, a remnant would still survive. This was particularly true in regard to the fearful judgments which Moses denounced on the nation if they should be disobedient, and which have been so strikingly fulfilled; Deut. 28. As the result of those judgments, Moses does not say that Yahweh would annihilate the nation, or extinguish their name, but that the would be 'left few in number,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#062">Deu 28:62</a>; that Yahweh would scatter them among all people, from the one end of the earth even to the other, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064">Deu 28:64</a>; and that among these nations they should find no ease, neither should the sole of their foot have rest.
 </p><p>In like manner it was predicted that they should be scattered everywhere. 'I will scatter them also among the pagan, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach, a proverb, a taunt, and a curse, in all places whither I will drive them;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016">Jer 9:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009">Jer 24:9-10</a>. 'I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010">Eze 5:10</a>. 'I will also scatter them among the nations, among the pagan, and disperse them in the countries;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015">Eze 12:15</a>, 'I will sift the house of Israel among the nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth. They shall be wanderers among the nations;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009">Amo 9:9</a>. 'I will make a full end of the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished;' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028">Jer 46:28</a>.
 </p><p>From all these, and from numerous other passages in the Old Testament, it is evident that it was designed that the Jewish nation should never be wholly destroyed; that though they were scattered among the nations, they should still be a distinct people; that while other nations would wholly cease to exist, yet that a "remnant" of the Jewish people, with the national peculiarities and customs, would still survive. How entirely this has been fulfilled, the remarkable history of the Jewish people everywhere testifies. Their present condition on the earth, as a people scattered in all nations, yet surviving; without a king and a temple, yet preserving their national prejudices and peculiarities, is a most striking fulfillment of the prophecy; see Keith's "Evidence of the Fulfillment of Prophecy," pp. 64-82.
 </p><p>From Assyria - The name Assyria is commonly applied to that region of country which lies between Media, Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Babylon, and which is now called Kurdistan. The boundaries of the kingdom have often varied, and, as a kingdom or separate nation, it has long since ceased to exist. The name "Assyria" in Scripture is given,
 </p><p>(1) To ancient Assyria, lying east of the Tigris, and between Armenia, Susiana, and Media - the region comprising mostly the modern kingdoms and the pashalic of Mosul.
 </p><p>(2) Most generally the name Assyria means the "kingdom of Assyria," including Babylonia and Mesopotamia, and extending to the Euphrates; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020">Isa 7:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isa 8:7</a>.
 </p><p>(3) After the overthrow of the Assyrian empire, the name continued to be applied to those countries which were formerly held under its dominion - including Babylonia <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029">Kg2 23:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018">Jer 2:18</a>, Persia <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022">Ezr 6:22</a>, and Syria. - "Robinson; Calmet."
 </p><p>It is in this place applied to that extensive region, and means that the Jews scattered there - of whom there have always been many - shall be brought under the dominion of the Messiah. If the Nestorian Christians in the mountains of Kurdistan are the descendants of the lost ten tribes (see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012">Isa 11:12</a>), then the reference here is, doubtless, to them. There are, however, other Jews there, as there always has been; "see" Dr. Grant's work on 'The Nestorians, or, the Lost Ten tribes,' New York, 1841.
 </p><p>And from Egypt - The well-known country in Africa, watered by the Nile. In all ages, there have been many Jews there. Its vicinity to Palestine; its remarkable fertility, and the advantages which it offered to them, attracted many Jews there; and at some periods they have composed no inconsiderable part of the population. It was in this country that the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into the Greek language, called the Septuagint, was made, for the use of the numerous Jews residing there. At present they are numerous there, though the exact number is unknown: During the reign of Bonaparte, an estimate was made, for his information, of the number of Jews in the world, and, in that estimate, 1,000,000 was assigned to the Turkish empire - probably about a third part of all on the earth. A large portion of this number is in Egypt.
 </p><p>And from Pathros - This was one of the three ancient divisions of Egypt. It was the same as Upper Egypt, or the southern part of Egypt, the "Coptic" portion of that country. The inhabitants of that country are called "Pathrusini." To that place many of the Jews retired in the calamities of the nation, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Isaiah; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001">Jer 44:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015">Jer 44:15</a>. For this act God severely threatened them; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#026">Jer 44:26-29</a>.
 </p><p>And from Cush - The Chaldee reads this, 'And from Judea.' The Syriac, 'And from Ethiopia.' This country denotes, properly, the regions settled by the descendants of Cush, the oldest son of Ham; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008">Gen 10:8</a>. Commentators have differed very much about the region understood in the Scriptures by the name Cush. Bochart supposes that by it the southern parts of Arabia are always meant. Gesenius supposes, that by Cush is always meant a region in Africa. Michaelis supposes that by Cush the southern part of Arabia and the African Ethiopia were both intended. In the Scriptures, however, it is evident that the name is given to different regions.
 </p><p>(1) It means what may be called the "Oriental Cush," including the region of the ancient Susiana, and bounded on the south by the Persian Gulf, and on the west and southwest by the Tigris, which separates it from the Arabian Irak. This province has the name Chusastan, or Chusistan, and was, probably, the ancient "Cush" mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010">Zep 3:10</a> : From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, (Hebrew, Cush), my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.' The principal rivers there were the Ulai, the Kur, the Chobar, and the Choaspes. The same place is referred to in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024">Kg2 17:24</a>, where the king of Assyria is said to have 'brought men from Babylon, and from "Cuthah," and from Ava,' where the word "Cuthah" evidently refers to Cush, the Armenian mode of pronouncing Cush by exchanging the letters "Shin" for "Tav," as they always do in pronouncing "Ashur," calling it "Athur, etc.;" see the Chaldee Paraphrase, and the Syriac version, "passim."
 </p><p>(2) "Cush," as employed by the Hebrews, "usually" denoted the southern parts of Arabia, and was situated chiefly along the coast of the Red Sea, since there are several passages of Scripture where the name "Cush" occurs which can be applied to no other country, and least of all to the African Cush or Ethiopia; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001">Num 12:1</a>, where the woman whom Moses married is called an 'Ethiopian,' (Hebrew, 'Cushite'). It can be scarcely supposed that she came from the distant regions of Ethiopia in Africa, but it is evident that she came from some part of Arabia. Also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007">Hab 3:7</a>, says:
 </p><p>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;
 </p><p>And the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
 </p><p>From which it is evident, that "Cushan" and "Midian" were countries adjacent; that is, in the southern part of Arabia; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016">Ch2 21:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009">Ch2 14:9</a>.
 </p><p>(3) The word "Cush" is applied to Ethiopia, or the country south of Egypt, now called Abyssinia. This country comprehended not only Ethiopia above Syene and the cataracts, but likewise Thebais, or Upper Egypt; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023">Jer 13:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003">Dan 11:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004">Eze 30:4-5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#014">Isa 44:14</a>; see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001">Isa 18:1</a>. To which of these regions the prophet here refers, it is not easy to determine. As the other countries mentioned here, however, are chiefly in the East, it is most natural to suppose that he refers to "the Oriental Cush" mentioned under the first division. The general idea of the prophet is plain, that the scattered Jews should be gathered back to God.
 </p><p>And from Elam - This was the name of a country originally possessed by the Persians, and so called from the son of Shem of the same name; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001">Gen 14:1</a>. It was the southern part of Persia, situated on the Persian Gulf, and included, probably, the whole of the region now called Susiana or Chusistan. The city Susa or Shushan was in it; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002">Dan 8:2</a>.
 </p><p>And from Shinar - This was a part of Babylonia, and is supposed to be the plain lying between the Tigris and the Euphrates; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010">Gen 10:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002">Gen 11:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002">Dan 1:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011">Zac 5:11</a>. It was the region elsewhere called Mesopotamia. The Septuagint renders it, 'And from Babylon;' and it is remarkable that Luke <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009">Act 2:9</a>, where he has reference, probably, to the place, speaks of 'the dwellers in Mesopotamia' as among those who heard 'the wonderful works of God' in their own language. It was in this plain that the tower of Babel was commenced; Gen. 10.
 </p><p>And from Hamath - See the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009">Isa 10:9</a>. "And from the islands of the sea." This expression probably denotes the islands situated in the Mediterranean, a part of which were known to the Hebrews. But, as geography was imperfectly known, the phrase came to denote the regions lying west of the land of Canaan; the unknown countries which were situated in that sea, or west of it, and thus included the countries lying around the Mediterranean. The word translated, 'islands' here (איים  'ı̂yı̂ym) means properly "habitable dry land," in opposition to water; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013">Isa 42:13</a> : 'I will make the rivers "dry land;"' where to translate it "islands" would make nonsense. Hence, it means also land adjacent to water, either washed by it, or surrounded by it, that is, a maritime country, coast, or island. Thus it means "coast" when applied to Ashdod <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006">Isa 20:6</a>; to Tyre <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002">Isa 22:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006">Isa 22:6</a>; to Peloponnesus or Greece (called Chittim, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#006">Eze 27:6</a>). It means an "island" when applied to Caphtor or Crete <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004">Jer 47:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007">Amo 9:7</a>. The word was commonly used by the Hebrews to denote distant regions beyond the sea, whether coasts or islands, and especially the maritime countries of the West, to them imperfectly known through the voyages of the Pheonicians; see the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001">Isa 41:1</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#015">Isa 24:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015">Isa 40:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004">Isa 42:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010">Isa 42:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#012">Isa 42:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005">Isa 51:5</a>.

 <p>And he shall set up an ensign - See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>. The Messiah shall stand in view of the nations, as a standard is erected by a military leader. An ensign or standard was usually lifted up on the mountains or on some elevated place (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003">Isa 18:3</a>); and the meaning here is, that the Messiah would be the conspicuous object around which the nations would rally.
 </p><p>And shall assemble - This word, אסף  'âsaph, properly means, to gather, collect, to assemble together, as fruits are collected for preservation <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#010">Exo 23:10</a>; to collect a people together <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016">Num 21:16</a>; to gather or collect gold; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004">Kg2 22:4</a>. It may also mean to gather or collect anything for destruction <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#013">Jer 8:13</a>; and hence, to take out of the way, to kill, destroy; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006">Sa1 15:6</a>. Here, it is evidently synonymous with the word 'recover' in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11</a>. It cannot be proved that it means that God will "literally" re-assemble all the scattered Jews, for the "collecting them," or regathering them to himself "as his people," though they may be still scattered among the nations, is all that the words necessarily imply. Thus when the word is used, as it is repeatedly, to denote the death of the patriarchs, where it is said they were 'gathered to their fathers,' it does not mean that they were buried in the same grave, or the same vicinity, but that they were united to them in death; they partook of the same lot; they all alike went down to the dead; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008">Gen 25:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029">Gen 35:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029">Gen 49:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024">Num 20:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#050">Deu 32:50</a>.
 </p><p>The outcasts of Israel - The name 'Israel,' applied at first to all the descendants of Jacob, came at length to denote the 'kingdom of Israel,' or of the 'ten tribes,' or of 'Ephraim,' as the tribes which revolted under Jeroboam were called. In this sense it is used in the Scriptures after the time of Jeroboam, and thus it acquired a technical signification, distinguishing it from Judah.
 </p><p>The dispersed of Judah - 'Judah,' also, though often used in a general sense to denote the Jews as such, without reference to the distinction in tribes, is also used technically to denote the kingdom of Judah, as distinguished from the kingdom of Israel. The tribe of Judah was much larger than Benjamin, and the name of the latter was lost in the former. A considerable part of the ten tribes returned again to their own land, with those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; a portion remained still in the countries of the East, and were intermingled with the other Jews who remained there. All distinctions of the tribes were gradually abolished, and there is no reason to think that the 'ten tribes,' here referred to by the name 'Israel,' have now anywhere a distinct and separate existence; see this point fully proved in a review of Dr. Grant's work on '" The Nestorians, or, the Lost Ten tribes,"' in the "Bib. Rep." for October 1841, and January 1842, by Prof. Robinson. The literal meaning here then would be, that he would gather the remains of those scattered people, whether pertaining to 'Israel' or 'Judah,' from the regions where they were dispersed.
 </p><p>It does not necessarily mean that they would be regathered in their distinctive capacity as 'Israel' and 'Judah,' or that the distinction would be still preserved, but that the people of God would be gathered together, and that all sources of alienation and discord would cease. The meaning, probably, is, that under the Messiah all the remains of that scattered people, in all parts of the earth, whether originally pertaining to 'Israel' or 'Judah,' should be collected into one spiritual kingdom, constituting one happy and harmonious people. To the fulfillment of this, it is not necessary to be supposed that they would be literally gathered into one place, or that they would be restored to their own land, or that they would be preserved as a distinct and separate community. The leading idea is, that the Messiah would set up a glorious kingdom in which all causes of alienation and discord would cease.
 </p><p>From the four corners of the earth - Chaldee, 'From the four winds of the earth.' The Septuagint renders it, 'From the four wings (πτερύγων  pterugōn) of the earth.' It means, that they should be collected to God from each of the four parts of the earth - the east, the west, the north, and the south. The Hebrew word rendered here 'corners,' means properly "wings." It is applied, however, to the corner, or border of a thing, as a skirt, or mantle <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#005">Sa1 24:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#011">Sa1 24:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001">Deu 23:1</a>; and hence, to the boundaries, or corners of the earth, because the earth seems to have been represented as a quadrangular plain; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#002">Eze 7:2</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013">Isaiah 11:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 11:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The envy also - The word "envy" here, is used in the sense of "hatred," or the hatred which arose from the "ambition" of Ephraim, and from the "prosperity" of Judah. Ephraim here, is the name for the kingdom of Israel, or the ten tribes. The reasons of their envy and enmity toward Judah, all arising from their ambition, were the following:
 </p><p>(1) This tribe, in connection with those which were allied to it, constituted a very large and flourishing part of the Jewish nation. They were, therefore, envious of any other tribe that claimed any superiority, and particularly jealous of Judah.
 </p><p>(2) they occupied a central and commanding position in Judea, and naturally claimed the pre-eminence over the tribes on the north.
 </p><p>(3) they had been formerly highly favored by the abode of the ark and the tabernacle among them, and, on that account, claimed to be the natural "head" of the nation; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001">Jos 18:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#008">Jos 18:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010">Jos 18:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031">Jdg 18:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019">Jdg 21:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003">Sa1 1:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#024">Sa1 1:24</a>.
 </p><p>(4) when Saul was king, though he was of the tribe of Benjamin <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002">Sa1 9:2</a>, they submitted peaceably to his reign, because the Benjaminites were in alliance with them, and adjacent to them. But when Saul died, and the kingdom passed into the hands of David, of the tribe of Judah, their natural rival, thus exalting that powerful tribe, they became dissatisfied and restless. David kept the nation united; but on his death, they threw off the yoke of his successor, and became a separate kingdom. From this time, their animosities and strifes became an importer and painful part of the history of the Jewish nation, until the kingdom of Ephraim was removed. The language here is evidently figurative, and means, that in the time here referred to under the messiah, the causes of animosity, before existing, would cease; that contentions between those who are, by nature, brethren, and who ought to evince the spirit of brethren, would come to an end; and that those animosities and strike would be succeeded by a state of amity and peace. When the scattered Jews shall be regathered to God under the Messiah, all the contentions among them shall cease, and they shall be united under one king and prince. All the causes of contention which had so long existed, and which had produced such disastrous results, would come to an end. The strifes and contentions of these two kingdoms, once belonging to the same nation, and descended from the same ancestors - the painful and protracted "family broil" - was the object that most prominently attracted the attention, then, of the prophets of God. The most happy idea of future blessedness which was presented to the mind of the prophet, was that period when all this should cease, and when, under the Messiah, all should be harmony and love.
 </p><p>And the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off - That is, Judah shall be safe; the people of God shall be delivered from their enemies - referring to the future period under the Messiah, when the church should be universally prosperous.
 </p><p>Judah shall not vex Ephraim - Shall not oppress, disturb, or oppose. There shall be peace between them. The church prospers only when contentions and strifes cease; when Christians lay aside their animosities, and love as brethren, and are "united" in the great work of spreading the gospel around the world. That time will yet come. When that time comes, the kingdom of the Son of God will be established. "Until" that time, it will be in vain that the effort is made to bring the world to the knowledge of the truth; or if not wholly in vain, the efforts of Christians who seek the conversion of the world will be retarded, embarrassed, and greatly enfeebled. How devoutly, therefore, should every friend of the Redeemer pray, that all causes of strife may cease, and that his people may be united, as the heart of one man, in the effort to bring the whole world to the knowledge of the truth. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014">Isaiah 11:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 11:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But they shall fly - The design of this verse is, to show the rapid and certain spiritual conquests which would result from the conversion of the scattered Jewish people. The Jews understood this literally, as referring to the conquests over their enemies. But if the exposition which has been given of this chapter thus far is correct, the passage is to be interpreted as a figurative description of the triumph of the people of God under the Messiah. The "time" to which it refers, is that which shall succeed the conversion of the scattered Jews. The "effect" of the gospel is represented under an image which, to Jews, would be most striking - that of conquest over the neighboring nations with whom they had been continually at war. Philistia, Edom, Moab, and Ammon, had been always the enemies of Judea; and to the Jews, no figurative representation could be more striking than that, "after" the union of Judah and Ephraim, they should proceed in rapid and certain conquest to subdue their ancient and formidable enemies. The meaning of the phrase 'they shall fly,' is, they shall hasten with a rapid motion, like a bird. They shall do it quickly, without delay, as an eagle hastens to its prey. It indicates their "suddenly" engaging in this, and the celerity and certainty of their movements. As the united powers of Judah and Ephraim would naturally make a sudden descent on Philistia, so the Jews, united under the Messiah, would go to the rapid and certain conversion of those who had been the enemies of the cross.
 </p><p>Upon the shoulders - בכתף  bekâthêph. There has been a great variety in the interpretation of this passage; and it is evident that our translation does not express a very clear idea. The Septuagint renders it, 'And they shall fly in the ships of foreigners, and they shall plunder the sea.' The Chaldee, 'And they shall be joined with one shoulder, that is, they shall be "united" shoulder to shoulder, that they may smite the Philistines who are in the west.' The Syriac, 'But they shall "plow" the Philistines;' that is, they shall subdue them, and cultivate their land. The word rendered, 'shoulder,' means, properly, "the shoulder," as of a man or beast <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007">Isa 46:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022">Isa 49:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009">Num 7:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#022">Job 31:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#004">Eze 24:4</a>; the undersetters or shoulders to support the lavers <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#030">Kg1 7:30</a>; a corner or side of a building <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#014">Exo 38:14</a>; and is applied to "the side" of anything, as the side of a building, the border of a country, a city, or sea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#008">Kg1 6:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039">Kg1 7:39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011">Num 34:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008">Jos 15:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#010">Jos 15:10-11</a>, ...) Here it seems to mean, not that the Jews would be borne "upon" the shoulder of the Philistines, but that they would make a sudden and rapid descent "upon their borders:" they would invade their territory, and carry their conquest 'toward the west.' The construction is, therefore, 'they shall make a rapid descent on the borders of the Philistines,' or, in other words, the spiritual conquest over the enemies of the church of God shall be certain and rapid.
 </p><p>The Philistines - Philistia was situated on the southwestern side of the land of Canaan. The Philistines were therefore adjacent to the Jews, and were often involved in war with them. They were among the most constant and formidable enemies which the Jews had.
 </p><p>Toward the west - This does not mean that they should be borne on the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; but that they should make a sudden and rapid descent on the Philistines, who "were" west of them. It stands opposed to the nations immediately mentioned as lying "east" of the land of Judea.
 </p><p>They shall spoil - They shall plunder; or, they shall take them, and their towns and property, as the spoil of war. That is, they shall vanquish them, and make them subject to them. According to the interpretation which has been pursued in this chapter, it means, that the enemies of God shall be subdued, and brought to the knowledge of the truth, in a rapid and decisive manner. The language is that which is drawn from the idea of conquest; the idea is that of a rapid and far-spreading conversion among the nations, to the gospel.
 </p><p>Them of the east - Hebrew, 'The sons of the east; that is, the nations east of Judea.
 </p><p>They shall lay their hand - Hebrew, 'Edom and Moab shall be the laying on of their hand;' that is, they shall lay their hand on those nations for conquest and spoil; they shall subdue them.
 </p><p>Edom - Idumea; the country settled by the descendants of Esau - a country that was south of Judea, and extended from the Dead Sea to the Elanitic gulf of the Red Sea. They were an independent people until the time of David, and were reduced to subjection by him, but they afterward revolted and became again independent. They were often engaged in wars with the Jews, and their conquest was an object that was deemed by the Jews to be very desirable (see the notes at Isa. 34.)
 </p><p>And Moab - The country of the Moabites was east of the river Jordan, on both sides of the river Arnon, and adjoining the Dead Sea. Their capital was on the river Arnon. They also were often involved in wars with the Jews (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003">Deu 23:3</a>; see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001">Isa 15:1-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001">Isa 16:1-14</a>.)
 </p><p>And the children of Ammon - The Ammonites, the descendants of Ammon, a son of Lot. Their country lay southeast of Judea <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019">Deu 2:19-21</a>. Their territory extended from the river Arnon north to the river Jabbok, and from the Jordan far into Arabia. It was directly north of Moab, They were often engaged, in alliance with the Moabites, in waging war against the Jews.
 </p><p>Shall obey them - Hebrew, 'Shall be their obedience.' All these descriptions are similar. They are not to be interpreted literally, but are designed to denote the rapid triumphs of the truth of God after the conversion of the Jews; and the sense is, that the conquests of the gospel will be as sudden, as great, and as striking over its enemies, as would have been the complete subjugation of Philistia, Moab, Ammon, and Edom, to the victorious army of the Jews. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isaiah 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">isa 11:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And the Lord - The prophet goes on with the description of the effect which shall follow the return of the scattered Jews to God. The language is figurative, and is here drawn from that which was the great storehouse of all the imagery of the Jews - the deliverance of their fathers from the bondage of Egypt. The general sense is, that all the embarrassments which would tend to impede them would be removed; and that God would make their return as easy and as safe, as would have been the journey of their fathers to the land of Canaan, if the 'Egyptian Sea' had been removed entirely, and if the 'river,' with its 'seven streams,' by nature so formidable a barrier, had been dried up, and a path had been made to occupy its former place. Figuratively, the passage means, that all the obstructions to the peace and safety of the people of God would be removed, and that their way would be easy and safe.
 </p><p>The tongue - The Hebrews applied the word 'tongue' to anything that resembled a tongue - to a bar of gold <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#021">Jos 7:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024">Jos 7:24</a>; to a flame of fire (note, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024">Isa 5:24</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003">Act 2:3</a>); to a bay of the sea, or a gulf, from its shape <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#005">Jos 15:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#019">Jos 18:19</a>. So we speak of a tongue of land. When it is said that the Lord would 'utterly destroy' it, it is equivalent to saying that it would be entirely dried up; that is, so as to present no obstruction.
 </p><p>Of the Egyptian Sea - Some interpreters, among whom is Vitringa, have supposed that by the tongue of the Egyptian Sea mentioned here, is meant the river Nile, which flows into the Mediterranean, here called, as they suppose, the Egyptian Sea. Vitringa observes that the Nile, before it flows into the Mediterranean, is divided into two streams or rivers, which form the Delta or the triangular territory lying between these two rivers, and bounded on the north by the Mediterranean. The eastern branch of the Nile being the largest, he supposes is called the tongue or "bay" of the Egyptian Sea. But to this interpretation there are obvious objections:
 </p><p>(1) It is not known that the Mediterranean is elsewhere called the Egyptian Sea.
 </p><p>(2) This whole description pertains to the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt The imagery is all drawn from that. But, in their departure, the Nile constituted no obstruction. Their place of residence, in Goshen, was east of the Nile. All the obstruction that they met with, from any sea or river, was from the Red Sea.
 </p><p>(3) The Red Sea is divided, at its northern extremity, into two bays, or forks, which may be called the "tongues" of the sea, and across one of which the Israelites passed in going from Egypt. Of these branches, the western one was called the Heroopolite branch, and the eastern, the Elanitic branch. It was across the western branch that they passed. When it is said that Yahweh would 'destroy' this, it means that he would dry it up so that it would be no obstruction; in other words, he would take the most formidable obstructions to the progress of his people out of the way.
 </p><p>And with his mighty wind - With a strong and powerful wind. Michaelis supposes that by this is meant a tempest. But there is, more probably, a reference to a strong and steady hot wind, such as blows over burning deserts, and such as would have a tendency to dry up even mighty waters. The illustration is, probably, derived from the fact that a strong east wind was employed to make a way through the Red Sea <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021">Exo 14:21</a>. If the allusion here be rather to a mighty wind or a tempest, than to one that is hot, and that tends to evaporate the waters even of the rivers, then it means that the wind would be so mighty as to part the waters, and make a path through the river, as was done in the Red Sea and at the Jordan. The "idea" is, that God would remove the obstructions to the rapid and complete deliverance and conversion of people.
 </p><p>Shall he shake his hand - This is to indicate that the mighty wind will be sent from God, and that it is designed to effect this passage through the rivers. The shaking of the band, in the Scripture, is usually an indication of anger, or of strong and settled purpose (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032">Isa 10:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002">Isa 13:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009">Zac 2:9</a>).
 </p><p>Over the river - Many have understood this as referring to the Nile; but two considerations show that the Euphrates is rather intended:
 </p><p>(1) The term 'the river' (הנהר  hanâhâr) is usually applied to the Euphrates, called the river, by way of eminence; and when the term is used without any qualification, that river is commonly intended (see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020">Isa 7:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isa 8:7</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#021">Gen 31:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#037">Gen 36:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021">Kg1 4:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010">Ezr 4:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#016">Ezr 4:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003">Ezr 5:3</a>).
 </p><p>(2) the effect of this smiting of the river is said to be <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016">Isa 11:16</a> that there would be a highway for the people "from Assyria," which could be caused only by removing the obstruction which is produced by the Euphrates lying between Judea and some parts of Assyria.
 </p><p>And shall smite it - That is to dry it up, or to make it pasable.
 </p><p>In the seven streams - The word 'streams' here (נחלים  nechâlı̂ym) denotes streams of much less dimensions than a river. It is applied to a "valley" with a brook running through it <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#019">Gen 26:19</a>; and then to any small brook or stream, or rivulet <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024">Gen 32:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015">Psa 74:15</a>. Here it denotes brooks or streams that would be fordable. When it is said that the river should be smitten 'in the seven streams,' the Hebrew does not mean that it was "already" divided into seven streams, and that God would smite "them," but it means, that God would smite it "into" seven streams or rivulets; that is, into "many" such rivulets (for the number seven is often used to denote a large indefinite number, Note, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001">Isa 4:1</a>); and the expression denotes, that though the river presented an obstruction, in its natural size, which they could not overcome, yet God would make new channels for it, and scatter it into innumerable rivulets or small streams, so that they could pass ever it dry-shod.
 </p><p>A remarkable illustration of this occurs in Herodotus (i. 189): 'Cyrus, in his march to Babylon, arrived at the river Gyndes, which, rising in the mountains of Matiene, and passing through the country of the Darneans, loses itself in the Tigris; and this, after flowing by Opis, is finally discharged into the Red Sea. While Cyrus was endeavoring to pass this river, which could not be perfomed without boats, one of the white consecrated horses boldly entering the stream, in his attempts to cross it, was borne away by the rapidity of the current, and totally lost. Cyrus, exasperated by the accident, made a vow that he would render this stream so very insignificant, that women should hereafter be able to cross it without so much as wetting their feet. He accordingly suspended his designs on Babylon, and divided his forces into two parts; he then marked out with a line on each side of the river, one hundred and eighty trenches; these were dug according to his orders, and so great a number of people were employed that he accomplished his purpose; but he thus wasted the whole of that summer' (see also Seneca, "De Ira." iii. 21).
 </p><p>Go over dry-shod - Hebrew, 'In shoes, or sandals.' The waters in the innumerable rivulets to which the great river should be reduced, would be so shallow, that they could even pass them in their sandals without wetting their feet - a strong figurative expression, denoting that the obstruction would be completely removed. 'The prophet, under these metaphors, intends nothing else than that there would be no impediment to God when he wished to deliver his people from captivity.' - (Calvin.) 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016">Isaiah 11:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">isa 11:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And there shall be an highway - All obstructions shall be removed, and they shall be permitted to return without hinderance (compare the note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008">Isa 35:8</a>).
 </p><p>For the remnant of his people from Assyria - See note at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11</a>.
 </p><p>Like as it was to Israel... - That is, God will remove all obstructions as he did at the Red Sea; he will subdue all their enemies; he will provide for their needs; and he will interpose by the manifest marks of his presence and protection, as their God and their friend. The general view of the chapter is, therefore, that it, refers to the triumph of the Messiah's kingdom; that it is not yet fully accomplished; and that the time is coming when the scattered Jews shall be regathered to God - not returned to their own land, but brought again under his dominion under the administration of the Messiah; and that this event shall be attended with a sudden removal of the obstructions to the gospel, and to its rapid spread everywhere among the nations. Comparing this with the present state of the Jews, we may remark, in regard to this prospect:
 </p><p>(1) That they are now, and will continue to be, scattered in all nations. They have been driven to all parts of the earth - wanderers without a home - yet continuing their customs, rites, and special opinions; and continuing to live, notwithstanding all the efforts of the nations to crush and destroy them.
 </p><p>(2) They speak nearly all the languages of the world. They are acquainted with all the customs, prejudices, and opinions of the nations of the earth. They would, therefore, be under no necessity of engaging in the laborious work of learning language - which now occupies so much of the time, and consumes so much of the strength of the modern missionary.
 </p><p>(3) The law of God is thus in all nations. It is in every synagogue; and it has been well said, that the law there is like extinguished candles, and that all that is needful to illuminate the world, is to light those candles. Let the Jew everywhere be brought to see the true meaning of his law; let the light of evangelical truth shine into his synagogue, and the world would be at once illuminated. The truth would go with the rapidity of the sunbeams from place to place, until the whole earth would be enlightened with the knowledge of the Redeemer.
 </p><p>(4) The Jews, when converted, make the best missionaries. There is a freshness in their views of the Messiah when they are converted, which Gentile converts seldom feel. The apostles were all Jews; and the zeal of Paul shows what converted Jews will do when they become engaged in making known the true Messiah. If it has been a characteristic of their nation that they would 'compass sea and land to make one proselyte,' what will their more than three million accomplish when they become converted to the true faith of the Redeemer? We have every reason, therefore, to expect that God intends to make great use yet of the Jews, whom he has preserved scattered everywhere - though they be but a 'remnant' - in converting the world to his Son. And we should most fervently pray, that they may be imbued with love to their long-rejected Messiah, and that they may everywhere become the missionaries of the cross.
