 <p>The narrative here is parallel with that in marginal reference, from which it varies but little, and to which it adds nothing.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011">Ch2 9:11</a>
 </p><p>Terraces - Rather, as in the margin, "stairs" (see the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#012">Kg1 10:12</a> note).
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#012">Ch2 9:12</a>
 </p><p>Beside that which she had brought unto the king - It is difficult to assign any sense to these words as they now stand in the Hebrew text. A slight alteration will give the meaning: "Beside that which the king had brought for her;" which is in conformity with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013">Kg1 10:13</a>.

 <p>Comparing <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016">Kg1 10:16-17</a>, it follows from the two passages together that the "pound of gold" was equal to 100 shekels.

 <p>The footstool (not mentioned in Kings) was an essential appendage to an Oriental throne; it appears everywhere in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian sculptures. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023">2 Chronicles 9:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">ch2 9:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>All the kings of the earth - Rather, "all the kings of the land:" all the monarchs, that is, whose dominions were included in So omon's empire (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021">Kg1 4:21</a>).

 <p>And out of all lands - An addition to the words in Kings. The principal countries would no doubt be Arabia and Armenia - the former always famous for its excellent breed; the latter mentioned in Ezekiel <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#014">Eze 27:14</a> as trading with horses in the fairs of Tyre.

 <p>The book of Nathan ... - On the "books" here mentioned, see the introduction to Chronicles, the second note.
 </p><p>We hear nothing of Iddo in Kings: but he is mentioned below twice <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015">Ch2 12:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022">Ch2 13:22</a>. In the latter of these passages he is called not "the seer," but "the prophet." He seems to have been the author of three works:
 </p><p>(1) Visions against Jeroboam;
 </p><p>(2) A book of genealogies; and
 </p><p>(3) A commentary or history.
 </p><p>According to some, he was identical with Oded, the father of Azariah, who prophesied in the reign of Asa (see the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001">Ch2 15:1</a> note).
