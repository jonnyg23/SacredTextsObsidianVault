 <p>The cities which Huram had restored to Solomon - These cities had not been mentioned previously by the writer of Chronicles, who, however, seems to assume that the fact of their having been given by Hiram to Solomon is known to his readers. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011">Kg1 9:11-13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003">2 Chronicles 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch2 8:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Hamath-zobah - Usually identified with the "great Hamath" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002">Amo 6:2</a>; the capital of Coele-Syria; but probably a town of Zobah otherwise unknown, which revolted from Solomon, and was reduced to subjection. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#005">2 Chronicles 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch2 8:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Built - "Rebuilt," or "repaired" (as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002">Ch2 8:2</a>). The two Beth-borons were both ancient cities (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010">Jos 10:10</a> note). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010">2 Chronicles 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch2 8:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>On the number compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016">Kg1 5:16</a> note. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011">2 Chronicles 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ch2 8:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Of Pharaoh - Here again the writer of Chronicles assumes in his reader a knowledge of the facts recorded in the marginal references 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#014">2 Chronicles 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch2 8:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The man of God - This phrase, so common in Kings (see the introduction to Kings, 4th note), is rare in Chronicles, and is applied only to Moses <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014">Ch1 23:14</a>, David, and one other prophet <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#007">Ch2 25:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#009">Ch2 25:9</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018">2 Chronicles 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">ch2 8:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It has been supposed that these ships were conveyed from Tyre to Ezion-geber, either
 </p><p>(1) round the continent of Africa, or
 </p><p>(2) across the isthmus of Suez.
 </p><p>But the writer probably only means that ships were given by Hiram to Solomon at this time, and in connection with the Ophir enterprise. These vessels may have been delivered at Joppa, and have been there carefully studied by the Jewish shipwrights, who then preceeded to Ezion-geber, and, assisted by Phoenicians, constructed ships after their pattern.
 </p><p>Four hundred and fifty talents - "Four hundred and twenty talents" in Kings <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028">Kg1 9:28</a>. One or other of the two texts has suffered from that corruption to which numbers are so especially liable.
