 <p> - The Family of Judah
 </p><p>1. עדלם  ‛ǎdûllâm, 'Adullam, "righteousness." חירה  chı̂yrâh Chirah, "nobility?"
 </p><p>2. שׁוּע  shûa‛, Shua', "luck, riches, cry."
 </p><p>3. ער  ‛êr, 'Er, "watching."
 </p><p>4. אונן  'ônân, Onan, "strong."

 </p><p>29. פרץ  perets, Perets, "breach."
 </p><p>This strange narrative is an episode in the history of Joseph; but an integral part of the "generations" of Jacob. It is loosely dated with the phrase "at that time." This does not indicate a sequel to the preceding record, the proper phrase for which is "after these things" (האלה חדברים אחר  'achar hadebārı̂ym hâ'ēleh <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001">Gen 22:1</a>). It implies rather a train of events that commenced at least in the past, some time before the closing incident of the previous narrative <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022">Gen 21:22</a>. But the sale of Joseph, which alone is recorded in the last chapter, only occupied some few weeks or months of a year. Hence, the circumstances contained in this memoir of Judah's family must have taken their rise before that event. The date "at that time," is rendered indefinite also by being attached to the phrase, "And it came to pass," which covers at least all the events in the first eleven verses of the chapter.
 </p><p>All this is in accordance with the customary mode of arranging parallel lines of events in Hebrew narrative. We shall see reason afterward for placing the birth of Er at as early a date as possible in the life of Judah <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012">Gen 46:12</a>. Now Judah, we conceive, was born when his father was eighty-seven, and Joseph when he was ninety-one, and hence, there is a difference about four years in their ages. We suppose Er to have been born in Judah's fourteenth year, when Joseph and Dinah were in their tenth, and therefore, about three years before the rape of Dinah, and shortly after Jacob arrived at the town of Shekem. The dishonor of Dinah, and the cruel treatment of Joseph, being of essential moment in the process of things, had to be recorded in the main line of events. The commencement of Judah's family, having no particular influence on the current of the history, is fitly reserved until the whole of the circumstances could be brought together into a connected narrative. And the private history of Judah's line is given, while that of the others is omitted, simply because from him the promised seed is descended. As soon as Jacob is settled in the promised land, the contact with Hebron and its neighborhood seems to have commenced. A clear proof of this is the presence of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, in Jacob's family <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008">Gen 35:8</a>. The great thoroughfare from Damascus to Egypt runs through Shekem and Hebron, and we know that when Jacob was residing at Hebron, his sons fed their flocks at Shekem and Dothan, and the youthful Joseph was sent to inquire after their welfare.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001">Gen 38:1-11</a>
 </p><p>Judah marries and has three sons. "Went down from brethren." This seems to have been an act of willful indiscretion in Judah. His separation from his brethren, however, extends only to the matter of his new connection. In regard to property and employment there seems to have been no long or entire separation until they went down into Egypt. He went down from the high grounds about Shekem to the lowlands in which Adullam was situated <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033">Jos 15:33-35</a>. "A certain Adullamite." He may have become acquainted with this Hirah, when visiting his grandfather, or in some of the caravans which were constantly passing Shekem, or even in the ordinary wanderings of the pastoral life. Adullam was in the Shephelah or lowland of Judah bordering on Philistia proper. "A certain Kenaanite." This connection with Shua's daughter was contrary to the will of God and the example of his fathers. Onan was born, we conceive, in Judah's fifteenth year, and Shelah in his sixteenth.
 </p><p>At Kezib. - This appears the same as Akzib, which is associated with Keilah and Mareshah <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044">Jos 15:44</a>, and therefore, lay in the south of the lowland of Judah. This note of place indicates a change of residence since her other children were born. In the year after this birth the dishonor of Dinah takes place. "Took a wife for Er." Judah chose a wife for himself at an early age, and now he chooses for his first-born at the same age. "Was evil in the eyes of the Lord." The God of covenant is obliged to cut off Er for his wickedness in the prime of life. We are not made acquainted with his crime; but it could scarcely be more vile and unnatural than that for which his brother Onan is also visited with death. "And be a husband to her." The original word means to act as a husband to the widow of a deceased brother who has left no issue. Onan seems to have been prompted to commit his crime by the low motive of turning the whole inheritance to his own house. At the time of Er's death Judah must have been in his twenty-seventh year; Joseph was consequently in his twenty-third, and Jacob had for ten years past had his headquarters at Hebron. Hence, the contact with Timnah, Adullam, and Enaim was easy.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012">Gen 38:12-23</a>
 </p><p>Judah now comes into criminal, and, though unknown to him, incestuous sexual intercourse with Tamar. "And many were the days," a year or somewhat more. "To Timnah." This town is about twenty miles northwest of Hebron. There is another, however, in the hills about seven miles south of Hebron. "Put on a veil;" to conceal her face from Judah, or any other beholder. "The qate of Enaim." This is supposed to be the same as Enam <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034">Jos 15:34</a>. "And thy lace." This is the cord by which the signet was suspended round his neck. "Courtesan." The original word קדשׁה  qedêshâh means one consecrated to the worship of Ashtoreth, in which chastity is sacrificed.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#024">Gen 38:24-30</a>
 </p><p>Tamar bears Perez and Zerah to Judah. After three months her pregnancy was manifest. "Let her be burnt." It is manifest Judah had the power to execute this punishment. The life of the widow of his son was in his hands. Stoning was the mode of punishment by the law of Moses <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#020">Deu 22:20-24</a>; burning, only in aggravated cases <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014">Lev 20:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009">Lev 21:9</a>. He is a severe judge in a case where he is equally criminal. "She hath been more righteous than I. Tamar was less culpable in this matter than Judah. For he was moved by lust to commit fornication, and was the indirect occasion of Tamar's conduct by withholding Selah. But Tamar, though wronged, was not free from blame in her mode of righting herself. The youthful indiscretion of Judah in forming an intermarriage with a Canaanitish family, without the concurrence of his brothers or his father, has been fruitful of crime. If this immorality goes on, the chosen family will be speedily absorbed in the surrounding paganism. Hence, we begin to see the necessity of an immediate removal to another land, where they may be kept more distinct from the native superstition. By the disclosure of Tamar Judah is brought to acknowledgment of his fault, and, we may infer, to repentance. His abstaining from all further sexual intercourse with her may be accepted as a proof of this. "A scarlet thread." The right of primogeniture here manifests its importance. "Perez" - a breach. Slight incidents become the foundation of names, and are often the hinges on which great events turn. The minutest circumstances connected with the progenitors of the promised seed have a lasting interest.
 </p><p>Judah was at the close of his twenty-ninth year when Perez and Zerah were born. The dates in his family history may be arranged as underneath, on the supposition that the first child was born when the father was in his fourteenth year. This hypothesis is fairly allowable when we take into consideration not only other cases, but the early willfulness of Judah, and the example he gave to his children. The command also to be fruitful and multiply <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011">Gen 35:11</a>, which was given especially to Jacob, may have had a tendency to encourage early marriages. It is certain that the Jewish rabbis considered a man to have transgressed a divine precept who passed the age of twenty without being married. They also fixed the marriageable age for males at thirteen years and a day. King Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah when he was not more than twelve <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002">Kg2 16:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#002">Kg2 18:2</a>; and King Josiah the father of Jehoiakim, when fourteen years of age <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001">Kg2 22:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036">Kg2 23:36</a>.
 </p><p>Judah 13 years 6 months when Er was born.
 </p><p>Judah 14 years 4 12 months when Onan was born.
 </p><p>Judah 15 years 3 months when Shelah was born.
 </p><p>Judah 28 years 9 months when Perez was born.
 </p><p>Judah 42 years 3 months when Hezron was born to Perez.
 </p><p>Judah 43 years 2 months when Hamul was born.
