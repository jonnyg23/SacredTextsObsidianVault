 <p>On the general character of the contents of this chapter see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010">Deu 21:10</a> note.

 <p>That which pertaineth unto a man - i. e. not only his dress but all that especially pertains distinctively to his sex; arms, domestic and other utensils, etc.
 </p><p>The distinction between the sexes is natural and divinely established, and cannot be neglected without indecorum and consequent danger to purity (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003">Co1 11:3-15</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006">Deuteronomy 22:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 22:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>These precepts are designed to cultivate a spirit of humanity. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004">Deu 25:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028">Lev 22:28</a>; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009">Co1 9:9-10</a>.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008">Deu 22:8</a>
 </p><p>The roofs of houses in Palestine were flat and used for various purposes. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006">Jos 2:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002">Sa2 11:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009">Act 10:9</a>, etc. A battlement was almost a necessary protection. It was to be, according to the rabbis, at least two cubits high (about 3 ft.). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009">Deuteronomy 22:9</a></p>

 <p>Compare the marginal reference. The prohibition of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010">Deu 22:10</a> was also dictated by humanity. The ox and the donkey being of such different size and strength, it would be cruel to the latter to yoke them together. These two animals are named as being those ordinarily employed in agriculture; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020">Isa 32:20</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012">Deuteronomy 22:12</a></p>

 <p>Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038">Num 15:38</a> and its note. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019">Deuteronomy 22:19</a></p>

 <p>The fine was to be paid to the father, because the slander was against him principally as the head of the wife's family. If the damsel were an orphan the fine reverted to herself. The fact that the penalties attached to bearing false witness against a wife are fixed and comparatively light indicates the low estimation and position of the woman at that time.
