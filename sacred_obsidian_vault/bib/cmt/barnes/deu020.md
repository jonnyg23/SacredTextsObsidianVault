 <p>Horses, and chariots - The most formidable elements of an Oriental host, which the Canaanites possessed in great numbers; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#016">Jos 17:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#003">Jdg 4:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005">Sa1 13:5</a>. Israel could not match these with corresponding forces (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016">Deu 17:16</a> note and references), but, having the God of battles on its side, was not to be dismayed by them; the assumption being that the war had the sanction of God, and was consequently just.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">deu 20:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The priest - Not the high priest, but one appointed for the purpose, and called, according to the rabbis, "the anointed of the war": hence, perhaps the expression of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004">Jer 6:4</a>, etc. "prepare ye" (literally consecrate) "war." Thus, Phinehas went with the warriors to fight against Midian (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006">Num 31:6</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004">Sa1 4:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011">Sa1 4:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#012">Ch2 13:12</a>).

 <p>The officers dedicated it - See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#006">Exo 5:6</a> note.
 </p><p>Compare the marginal references. The expression is appropriate, because various ceremonies of a religious kind were customary among the Jews on taking possession of a new house. The immunity conferred in this verse lasted, like that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#007">Deu 20:7</a> (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005">Deu 24:5</a>), for one year. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006">Deuteronomy 20:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 20:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>See the margin and references. The fruit of newly-planted trees was set apart from common uses for four years. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#009">Deuteronomy 20:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 20:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The meaning is that the "officers" should then subdivide the levies, and appoint leaders of the smaller divisions thus constituted. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010">Deuteronomy 20:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 20:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Directions intended to prevent wanton destruction of life and property in sieges.

 </p><p>Forbearance, however, was not to be shown toward the Canaanite nations, which were to be utterly exterminated (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001">Deu 7:1-4</a>). The command did not apply to beasts as well as men (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#011">Jos 11:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#014">Jos 11:14</a>).
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019">Deu 20:19</a>
 </p><p>The parenthesis may he more literally rendered "for man is a tree of the field," i. e., has his life from the tree of the field, is supported in life by it (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006">Deu 24:6</a>). The Egyptians seem invariably to have cut down the fruit-trees in war.
