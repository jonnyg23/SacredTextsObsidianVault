 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">col 4:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Seasoned with salt (ἅλατι ἠρτυμένος)
 </p><p>Both words only here in Paul. The metaphor is from the office of salt in rendering palatable. Both in Greek and Latin authors, salt was used to express the pungency and wittiness of speech. Horace speaks of having praised a poet for rubbing the city with abundant salt, i.e., for having wittily satirized certain parties so as to make them smart as if rubbed with salt, and so as to excite the laughter of those who are not hit ("Satires," 1 x., 3). Lightfoot gives some interesting citations from Plutarch, in which, as here, grace and salt are combined. Thus: "The many call salt χάριτας graces, because, mingled with most things, it makes them agreeable and pleasant to the taste." Seasoned is, literally, prepared. It is not likely that the fact has any connection with this expression, but it is interesting to recall Herodotus' story of a salt lake in the neighborhood of Colossae, which has been identified, and which still supplies the whole surrounding country with salt (vii., 30). The exhortation to well-seasoned and becoming speech is expanded in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029">Eph 4:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004">Eph 5:4</a>, in a warning against corrupt communication.

 <p>Tychicus
 </p><p>Mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004">Act 20:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021">Eph 6:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012">Ti2 4:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012">Tit 3:12</a>.
 </p><p>Minister (διάκονος)
 </p><p>Probably to Paul himself. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022">Act 19:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004">Act 20:4</a>. Scarcely in the official sense of deacon.
 </p><p>Fellow-servant (σύνδουλος)
 </p><p>Used by Paul only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007">Col 1:7</a>, of Epaphras. By this term he designates Tychicus as, in common with himself, a servant of Jesus Christ. Probably not with a strict, but with a quasi official reference.

 </p><p>Epistolary aorist. Tychicus carried the letter.
 </p><p>He might know your estate (γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν)
 </p><p>The correct reading is γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν ye might know the things about us, or our estate. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021">Eph 6:21</a>.

 <p>Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023">Plm 1:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024">Plm 1:24</a>. Unnecessary difficulty is made over the fact that the term fellow-prisoner is applied to Epaphras in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023">Plm 1:23</a>, and not to Aristarchus; while here the case is reversed. It is not necessary to suppose that the two had changed places, or that the captivity was voluntary, if a literal captivity was meant. All the three terms fellow-prisoner, fellow-servant, fellow-worker - might be applied to both; and, as Dwight remarks, "Reasons unknown to us may easily have determined the use of one word or the other, independently of the question as to the particular time when they were in imprisonment."

 </p><p>Sister's son (ἀνεψιός)
 </p><p>Only here in the New Testament. Rev., correctly, cousin. The sense of nephew did not attach to the word until very late. Lightfoot remains that this incidental notice explains why Barnabas should have taken a more favorable view of Mark's defection than Paul, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037">Act 15:37</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039">Act 15:39</a>.

 <p>Jesus Justus
 </p><p>Not mentioned elsewhere. The only one of these names not mentioned in the salutations of the Epistle to Philemon.
 </p><p>Have been a comfort (ἐγενήθησαν παρηγορία)
 </p><p>Παρηγορία comfort, only here in the New Testament. Properly, an address, an exhortation: an exhortation for the purpose of encouraging: hence a comfort. Plutarch, in his "Life of Cimon," uses it with πένθους grief; a comfort, for grief; and in his "Life of Pericles," of consolation for a dead son. Aretaeus, a medical writer, of the assuaging of a paroxysm. This word, and the kindred adjectives παρηγορικός and παρηγορητικός soothing, are common in medical writings. So Galen, of soothing fictions, pretenses to quiet the diseased. Have been is, more strictly, have proved.

 </p><p>Rev., striving. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029">Col 1:29</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001">Col 2:1</a>. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030">Rom 15:30</a>.

 </p><p>Complete (πεπληροφορημένοι)
 </p><p>See on most surely believed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001">Luk 1:1</a>; and compare full assurance, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002">Col 2:2</a>. Rev., fully assured.
 </p><p>In all the will (ἐν παντὶ θελήματι)
 </p><p>Lit., in every will. Will means the thing willed, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047">Luk 12:47</a>; James 5:30; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018">Th1 5:18</a>. Hence used sometimes in the plural, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022">Act 13:22</a>, shall do all my will (θελήματα), i.e., perform all the things willed by me. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003">Eph 2:3</a>, desires, strictly willings. So here the sense is, everything willed by God. The connection is apparently with σταθῆτε ye may stand. For a similar construction see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044">Joh 8:44</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001">Co1 15:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013">Co1 16:13</a>. As Meyer observes, this connection gives stand both a modal definition (perfect and fully assured) and a local definition (in all the will).

 <p>Zeal (ζῆλον)

Πονος labor is from the root of πένομαι to work for one's daily bread, and thence to be poor. Πόνος toil, πένης one who works for his daily bread, and πονηρός wicked, have a common root. See on wickedness, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022">Mar 7:22</a>. In their original conceptions, κόπος labor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058">Co1 15:58</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005">Co2 6:5</a>) emphasizes the fatigue of labor: μόχθος hard labor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027">Co2 11:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009">Th1 2:9</a>), the hardship: πόνος the effort, but πόνος has passed, in the New Testament, in every instance but this, into the meaning of pain.
 </p><p>Hierapolis
 </p><p>The cities are named in geographical order. Laodicaea and Hierapolis faced each other on the north and south sides of the Lycus valley, about six miles apart. Colossae was ten or twelve miles farther up the stream. Hierapolis owed its celebrity to its warm mineral springs, its baths, and its trade in dyed wools. It was a center of the worship of the Phrygian goddess Cybele, whose rites were administered by mutilated priests known as Galli, and of other rites representing different oriental cults. Hence the name Hierapolis or sacred city.

 </p><p>His house (αὐτοῦ)
 </p><p>Others read αὐτῶν their (so Rev., Lightfoot, Meyer). Others, as Westcott and Hort, αὐτῆς her, regarding the name as female, Nympha. It is difficult, however, to know to whom the plural can refer. Some explain, Nymphas and his family. Meyer refers it to the brethren at Laodicaea and Nymphas, and thinks that the allusion is to a foreign church in filial association with the church at Laodicaea, and holding its meetings in the same place.
