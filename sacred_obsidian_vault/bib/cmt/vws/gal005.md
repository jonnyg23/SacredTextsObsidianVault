 <p>In the liberty wherewith. This is according to the reading τῆ ἐλευθερίᾳ ᾗ. Different connections are proposed, as with stand fast, as A.V.: or with the close of chapter 4, as, "we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free with the freedom with which Christ freed us": or, "of her who is free with the freedom with which," etc. But ᾗ wherewith must be omitted. A new clause begins with τῇ ἐλευθερίᾳ. Rend. for freedom did Christ set us free. For, not with freedom. It is the dative of advantage; that we might be really free and remain free. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013">Gal 5:13</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036">Joh 8:36</a>.
 </p><p>Made (us) free (ἠλευθέρωσεν)
 </p><p>With the exception of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032">Joh 8:32</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036">Joh 8:36</a>, only in Paul.
 </p><p>Stand fast (στήκετε)
 </p><p>Used absolutely, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015">Th2 2:15</a>. Mostly in Paul. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008">Th1 3:8</a>.
 </p><p>Be not entangled (μὴ ἐνέχεσθε)
 </p><p>Or, held ensnared. By Paul only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004">Th2 1:4</a>. Lit. to be held within. For an elliptical usage see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019">Mar 6:19</a>.
 </p><p>Yoke (ζυγῷ)
 </p><p>Metaphorical, of a burden or bondage. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029">Mat 11:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030">Mat 11:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010">Act 15:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001">Ti1 6:1</a>.

So always in N.T. except <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005">Rev 6:5</a>, where it means a pair of scales. See note, and comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035">Lev 19:35</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036">Lev 19:36</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001">Pro 11:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011">Pro 16:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007">Hos 12:7</a>.

 <p>Behold (ἴδε)
 </p><p>Imperative singular, appealing to each individual reader.
 </p><p>I Paul
 </p><p>Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001">Co2 10:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001">Eph 3:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023">Col 1:23</a>. Asserting his personal authority.
 </p><p>If ye be circumcised (ἐὰν περιτέμνησθε)
 </p><p>Better, receive circumcision. The verb does not mean that they have already been circumcised. It states the case as supposable, implying that they were in danger of allowing themselves to be circumcised.
 </p><p>Christ will profit you nothing
 </p><p>Circumcision is the sign of subjection to the Jewish "yoke" - the economy of the law. The question with the Galatians was circumcision as a condition of salvation. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003">Gal 2:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005">Gal 2:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001">Act 15:1</a>. It was a choice between salvation by law and salvation by Christ. The choice of the law involved the relinquishment of Christ. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021">Gal 2:21</a>. Chrysostom says: "He who is circumcised is circumcised as fearing the law: but he who fears the law distrusts the power of grace: and he who distrusts gains nothing from that which he distrusts."

 <p>Again (πάλιν)
 </p><p>Probably with reference to what he had said at his last visit.
 </p><p>Every man
 </p><p>Emphasizing and particularising the general to you, you, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002">Gal 5:2</a>.
 </p><p>A debtor (ὀφειλέτης)
 </p><p>In N.T. mostly of one under moral obligation. So in the sense of sinner, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012">Mat 6:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#004">Luk 13:4</a>. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014">Rom 1:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#012">Rom 8:12</a>. Similarly the verb ὀφείλειν to owe, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004">Luk 11:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010">Luk 17:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001">Rom 15:1</a>, etc., though it is frequent in the literal sense.
 </p><p>To do the law (ποιῆσαι)
 </p><p>Rare in N.T. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019">Joh 7:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013">Rom 2:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025">Rom 2:25</a> (πράσσῃς). Τηρεῖν to observe the law, the tradition, the commandment, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017">Mat 19:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#009">Mar 7:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015">Joh 14:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005">Act 15:5</a> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010">Jam 2:10</a> : πληροῦν to fulfill the law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008">Rom 13:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014">Gal 5:14</a>; comp. ἀναπληροῦν <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002">Gal 6:2</a> : φυλάσσειν to keep or guard the law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053">Act 7:53</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024">Act 21:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013">Gal 6:13</a> : also with commandments, word of God or of Christ, ordinances of the law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#020">Mat 19:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#020">Mar 10:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028">Luk 11:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047">Joh 12:47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026">Rom 2:26</a>.

Ποιῆσαι is to perform what the law commands: τηρεῖν to observe, keep an eye on with the result of performing: φυλάσσειν to guard against violation: τελεῖν to bring to fulfillment in action.
 </p><p>The whole law (ὅλον)
 </p><p>Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010">Jam 2:10</a>. Submission to circumcision commits one to the whole law. It makes him a party to the covenant of the law, and the law requires of every one thus committed a perfect fulfillment, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010">Gal 3:10</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004">Galatians 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gal 5:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Christ is become of no effect unto you (κατηργήθητε ἀπὸ Χριστοῦ)
 </p><p>Incorrect. Lit. ye were brought to nought from Christ. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002">Rom 7:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006">Rom 7:6</a>. Your union with Christ is dissolved. The statement is compressed and requires to be filled out. "Ye were brought to nought and so separated from Christ." For similar instances see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Rom 9:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003">Rom 11:3</a>. The ἀπὸ from properly belongs to the supplied verb of separation. For the verb καταργεῖν see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003">Rom 3:3</a>.
 </p><p>Ye are fallen from grace (τῆς χἁριτος ἐξεπέσατε)
 </p><p>For a similar phrase see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017">Pe2 3:17</a>. Having put yourselves under the economy of salvation by law, you have fallen out of the economy of salvation by the grace of Christ. Paul's declarations are aimed at the Judaisers, who taught that the Christian economy was to be joined with the legal. His point is that the two are mutually exclusive. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004">Rom 4:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005">Rom 4:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014">Rom 4:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016">Rom 4:16</a>. The verb ἐκπίπτειν to fall out, in the literal sense, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007">Act 12:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011">Jam 1:11</a>. In Class. of seamen thrown ashore, banishment, deprivation of an office, degeneration, of actors being hissed off the stage.

 <p>For we (ἡμεῖς γὰρ)
 </p><p>Γὰρ for introduces a proof of the preceding statement, by declaring the contrary attitude of those who continue under the economy of grace. Ye who seek to be justified by the law are fallen from grace; for we, not relying on the law, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
 </p><p>Through the Spirit (πνεύματι)
 </p><p>The Holy Spirit who inspires our faith. Not as Lightfoot, spiritually. The words πνεύματι ἐκ πίστεως are not to be taken as one conception, the Spirit which is of faith, but present two distinct and coordinate facts which characterize the waiting for the hope of righteousness; namely, the agency of the Holy Spirit, in contrast with the flesh (comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006">Rom 7:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004">Rom 8:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Rom 8:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016">Rom 8:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Eph 1:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022">Eph 2:22</a>), and faith in contrast with the works of the law (comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003">Gal 3:3</a>, and see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016">Gal 2:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003">Gal 3:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Rom 1:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022">Rom 3:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030">Rom 9:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006">Rom 10:6</a>).
 </p><p>By faith (ἐκ πίστεως)
 </p><p>Const. with wait, not with righteousness.
 </p><p>Wait for (ἀπεκδεχόμεθα)
 </p><p>Quite often in Paul, and only twice elsewhere, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028">Heb 9:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020">Pe1 3:20</a>. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020">Phi 3:20</a>.
 </p><p>The hope of righteousness (ἐπίδα δικαιοσύνης)
 </p><p>Hope for the object of hope, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005">Col 1:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018">Heb 6:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013">Tit 2:13</a>. The phrase means that good which righteousness causes us to hope for. Comp. hope of the calling (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018">Eph 1:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004">Eph 4:4</a>): hope of the gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023">Col 1:23</a>).

 </p><p>In the economy of life which he inaugurates and inspires.
 </p><p>Availeth (ἰσχύει)
 </p><p>Has any significance or practical power. The verb in Paul only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013">Phi 4:13</a>. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009">Th2 1:9</a>.

Not passive, as by many Roman Catholic expositors, faith which is wrought by love.
 </p><p>By love (δἰ ἀγάπης)
 </p><p>Not that justification is through love; but the faith of the justified, which is their subjective principle of life, exhibits its living energy through love in which the whole law is fulfilled (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014">Gal 5:14</a>). See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005">Ti1 1:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001">Co1 13:1-13</a>.

 </p><p>Bravely, becomingly, honorably to yourselves and to the church. Often in Paul.

 </p><p>Obey the truth (ἀληθείᾳ πείθεσθαι)
 </p><p>The exact phrase N.T.o. Disobey (ἀπειθοῦσι) the truth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008">Rom 2:8</a> : obedience (ὑπακοή) of the truth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022">Pe1 1:22</a>.

 <p>This persuasion (ἡ πεισμονὴ)
 </p><p>Or, the persuasion. N.T.o. olxx, oClass. It occurs in Ignatius, Rom. iii.: and Just. Mart. Ap. i. 53. The sense is not passive, your being persuaded, but active, the persuasion which the Judaising teachers exert over you. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004">Co1 1:4</a>, πιθοῖς λόγοις persuasive words. There may be a slight word play on πείθεσθαι and πεισμονὴ. Obedience to the truth is the result of the persuasive power of the truth.
 </p><p>Him that calleth (τοῦ καλοῦντος)
 </p><p>Very often applied to God by Paul. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030">Rom 8:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011">Rom 9:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009">Co1 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015">Co1 7:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015">Gal 1:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012">Th1 2:12</a> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007">Th1 4:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024">Th1 5:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014">Th2 2:14</a>.

 <p>A little leaven (μικρὰ ζύμη)
 </p><p>A proverbial warning, which appears also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006">Co1 5:6</a>. It refers, not to the doctrine of the false teachers, but to the false teachers themselves. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015">Mar 8:15</a>. With the single exception of the parable, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033">Mat 13:33</a>, leaven, in Scripture, is always a symbol of evil. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015">Exo 12:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019">Exo 12:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003">Exo 13:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#007">Exo 13:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018">Exo 23:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011">Lev 2:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003">Deu 16:3</a>. This, however, is no warrant for the nonsense which has been deduced from it, as that Jesus' parable of the leaven contains a prophecy of the corruption of Christianity. Because leaven in Scripture is habitually the type of corruption, we are "none the less free to use it in a good sense as Christ did. One figure need not always stand for one and the same thing. The devil is 'a roaring lion,' but Christ is also 'the lion of the tribe of Judah'" (Trench). It is an apt figure of secret, pervading energy, whether bad or good. A new interest is given to the figure by Pasteur's discovery that fermentation is a necessary consequence of the activity and growth of living organisms. A very few of these Judaising intruders are sufficient to corrupt the whole church.

 <p>And I
 </p><p>In sharp contrast with the disturber.
 </p><p>If I yet preach circumcision (εἰ περιτομὴν ἔτι κηρύσσω)
 </p><p>Commonly explained as an allusion to a charge circulated by the Judaisers that Paul preached or sanctioned the circumcision of Gentile converts in churches outside of Galatia, as, for example, in the case of Timothy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Act 16:3</a>. But it is quite unlikely that any such charge was circulated. The Judaisers would not have founded such a charge on an individual case or two, like Timothy's, especially in the face of the notorious fact that Paul, in Jerusalem and Antioch, had contested the demand for the circumcision of Gentile Christians; and Paul's question, "Why do I suffer persecution?" would have been pertinent only on the assumption that he was charged with habitually. not occasionally, preaching circumcision. Had the Judaisers actually circulated such a charge, Paul would have been compelled to meet it in a far more direct and thorough manner than he does here. He would have been likely to formulate the charge, and to deal incisively with the inconsistency in his preaching which it involved. The course of his thought is as follows: "He that troubleth you by preaching circumcision shall bear his judgment; but I am not a disturber - not your enemy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016">Gal 4:16</a>), for I do not preach circumcision; and the proof of this is that I am persecuted. If I preached circumcision, there would be no offense, and therefore no disturbance; for the cross would cease to be an offense, if, in addition to the cross, I preached just what the Judaisers assert, the necessity of circumcision."
 </p><p>Yet (ἔπι)
 </p><p>As in the time before my conversion. The second ἔπι is not temporal but logical, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007">Rom 3:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019">Rom 9:19</a>. What further ground is there for persecuting me?

 </p><p>Ceased (κατήργηται)
 </p><p>Lit. been done away or brought to nought. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004">Gal 5:4</a>. If Paul had preached circumcision as necessary to salvation, the preaching of the cross would have ceased to be an offense, because, along with the cross, Paul would have preached what the Judaisers demanded, that the Mosaic law should still be binding on Christians. The Judaisers would have accepted the cross with circumcision, but not the cross instead of circumcision. The Judaisers thus exposed themselves to no persecution in accepting Christ. They covered the offense of the cross, and conciliated unbelieving Jews by maintaining that the law was binding upon Christians. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012">Gal 6:12</a>.

 <p>They were cut off (ἀποκόψονται)
 </p><p>More correctly, would cut themselves off. Perhaps the severest expression in Paul's Epistles. It turns on the practice of circumcision. Paul says in effect: "These people are disturbing you by insisting on circumcision. I would that they would make thorough work of it in their own case, and, instead of merely amputating the foreskin, would castrate themselves, as heathen priests do. Perhaps that would be even a more powerful help to salvation." With this passage should be compared <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002">Phi 3:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003">Phi 3:3</a>, also aimed at the Judaisers: "Beware of the concision" (τὴν κατατομήν), the word directing attention to the fact that these persons had no right to claim circumcision in the true sense. Unaccompanied by faith, love, and obedience, circumcision was no more than physical mutilation.

 </p><p>Love (ἀγάπη)
 </p><p>Comp. love of the Spirit, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030">Rom 15:30</a>. In Class. φιλεῖν is the most general designation of love, denoting an inner inclination to persons or things, and standing opposed to μισεῖν or ἐχθαίρειν to hate. It occasionally acquires from the context a sensual flavor, as Hom. Od. xviii. 325; Hdt. iv. 176, thus running into the sense of ἐρᾶν which denotes sensual love. It is love to persons and things growing out of intercourse and amenities or attractive qualities. Στέργειν (not in N.T., lxx, Sir. 27:17) expresses a deep, quiet, appropriating, natural love, as distinguished from that which is called out by circumstances. Unlike φιλεῖν, it has a distinct moral significance, and is not applied to base inclinations opposed to a genuine manly nature. It is the word for love to parents, wife, children, king or country, as one's own. Aristotle (Nic. ix. 7, 3) speaks of poets as loving (στέργοντες) their own poems as their children. See also Eurip. Med. 87. Ἁγαπᾶν is to love out of an intelligent estimate of the object of love. It answers to Lat. diligere, or Germ. schatzen to prize. It is not passionate and sensual as ἐρᾶν. It is not, like φιλεῖν, attachment to a person independently of his quality and created by close intercourse. It is less sentiment than consideration. While φιλεῖν contemplates the person, ἀγαπᾶν contemplates the attributes and character, and gives an account of its inclination. Ἁγαπᾶν is really the weaker expression for love, as that term is conventionally used. It is judicial rather than affectionate. Even in classical usage, however, the distinction between ἀγαπᾶν and φιλεῖν is often very subtle, and well-nigh impossible to express.
 </p><p>In N.T. ἐπιθυμαῖν to desire or lust is used instead of ἐρᾶν. In lxx ἀγαπᾶν is far more common than φιλεῖν. Φιλεῖν occurs only 16 times in the sense of love, and 16 times in the sense of kiss; while ἀγαπᾶν is found nearly 300 times. It is used with a wide range, of the love of parent for child, of man for God, of God for man, of love to one's neighbor and to the stranger, of husband for wife, of love for God's house, and for mercy and truth; but also of the love of Samson for Delilah, of Hosea for his adulterous wife, of Amnon's love for Tamar, of Solomon's love for strange women, of loving a woman for her beauty. Also of loving vanity, unrighteousness, devouring words, cursing, death, silver.
 </p><p>The noun ἀγάπη, oClass., was apparently created by the lxx, although it is found there only 19 times. It first comes into habitual use in Christian writings. In N.T. it is, practically, the only noun for love, although compound nouns expressing peculiar phases of love, as brotherly love, love of money, love of children, etc., are formed with φίλος, as φιλαδελφία, φιλαργυρία, φιλανθρωπία. Both verbs, φιλεῖν and ἀγαπᾶν occur, but ἀγαπᾶν more frequently. The attempt to carry out consistently the classical distinction between these two must be abandoned. Both are used of the love of parents and children, of the love of God for Christ, of Christ for men, of God for men, of men for Christ and of men for men. The love of man for God and of husband for wife, only ἀγαπᾶν. The distinction is rather between ἀγαπᾶν and ἐπιθυμεῖν than between ἀγαπᾶν and φιλεῖν. Love, in this passage, is that fruit of the Spirit which dominates all the others. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013">Gal 5:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014">Gal 5:14</a>.

 <p>Lipsius makes this verse the beginning of ch. 6. Weizscker begins that chapter with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026">Gal 5:26</a>. There seems to be no sufficient reason. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025">Gal 5:25</a> is connected naturally with the immediately preceding line of thought. "Such being your principle of life, adapt your conduct (walk) to it." The hortatory form of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026">Gal 5:26</a>, and its contents, fall in naturally with the exhortation to walk by the Spirit, and with the reference to biting and devouring, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015">Gal 5:15</a>, and envyings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021">Gal 5:21</a>. The connection of the opening of ch. 6 with the close of ch. 5 is not so manifest; and the address brethren and the change to the second person (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001">Gal 6:1</a>) seem to indicate a new section.
 </p><p>In the Spirit (πνεύματι)
 </p><p>Better, by the Spirit, the dative being instrumental as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016">Gal 5:16</a>.
 </p><p>Walk (στοιχῶμεν)
 </p><p>A different word from that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016">Gal 5:16</a>. Only in Paul, except <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024">Act 21:24</a>. From στοίχος a row. Hence, to walk in line; to march in battle order (Xen. Cyr. vi. 3, 34). Συνστοιχεῖ answereth to, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025">Gal 4:25</a> (note). See also on στοιχεία elements, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003">Gal 4:3</a>. Paul uses it very graphically, of falling into line with Abraham's faith, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012">Rom 4:12</a>.

 <p>Desirous of vainglory (κενόδοξοι)
 </p><p>N.T.o. Better, vainglorious. The noun κενοδοξία vainglory only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003">Phi 2:3</a>. In lxx see Wisd. 14:14; 4 Macc. 2:15; 8:18. Originally, vain opinion, error. Ignatius, Magn. xi., speaks of falling into ἄγκιστρα τῆς κενοδοξίας the hooks or clutches of error. Δόξα has not the sense of opinion in N.T., but that of reputation, glory. This compound means having a vain conceit of possessing a rightful claim to honor. Suidas defines any vain thinking about one's self. It implies a contrast with the state of mind which seeks the glory of God. The modes in which vainglory may show itself are pointed out in the two following participles, provoking and envying.
 </p><p>Provoking (προκαλούμενοι)
 </p><p>N.T.o. lxx, only 2 Macc. 8:11. Lit. calling forth, challenging, and so stirring up strife. Very common in Class.
