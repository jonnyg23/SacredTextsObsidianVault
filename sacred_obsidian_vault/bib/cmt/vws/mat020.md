 <p>For (γάρ)
 </p><p>Explaining and confirming <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#030">Mat 19:30</a>.
 </p><p>Early in the morning (ἅμα πρωὶ)
 </p><p>Along with the dawn. "Here (at Hamadan, in Persia), we observed every morning, before the sun rose, that a numerous band of peasants were collected, with spades in their hands, waiting to be hired for the day to work in the surrounding fields. This custom struck me as a most happy illustration of our Saviour's parable, particularly when, passing by the same place late in the day, we found others standing idle, and remembered his words, 'Why stand ye here all the day idle?' as most applicable to their situation; for on putting the very same question to them, they answered us, ' Because no man hath hired us.'" (Morier, "Second Journey through Persia," cited by Trench, "Parables.")

 <p>For a penny (ἐκ δηναρίον)
 </p><p>A denarius, the chief silver coin of the Romans at this time, and of the value of about seventeen cents. We must remember to reckon according to the rate of wages in that day. A denarius was regarded as good pay for a day's work. It was the pay of a Roman soldier in Christ's time. In almost every case where the word occurs in the New Testament it is connected with the idea of a liberal or large amount. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#028">Mat 18:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#037">Mar 6:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#041">Luk 7:41</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#005">Joh 12:5</a>.
 </p><p>For a penny is, literally, out of or on the strength of a penny; the payment being that on the strength of which the agreement was made. The agreement arose out of the demand on the one hand and the promise on the other.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mat 20:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Every man a penny (τὸ ἀνὰ δηνάριον)
 </p><p>Lit., the sum amounting in each case to a penny; or a penny apiece. Ἀνά is distributive. Wyc., each one by himself a penny.

 <p>Heat (καύσωνα)
 </p><p>Rev., the scorching heat. The word is from καίω, to burn. It refers to the dry, scorching heat borne by the east wind. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015">Hos 13:15</a>. The wind blows from the Arabian desert, parching, dry, exciting the blood, and causing restlessness and sleeplessness. It seldom brings storms, but when it does, they are doubly destructive, During harvest the corn cannot be winnowed if the east wind blows, for it would carry away both chaff and corn. In Pharaoh's dream (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#006">Gen 41:6</a>) the ears are blasted by it: Jonah's gourd is withered by it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008">Jon 4:8</a>), and the vine in Ezekiel's parable of the Babylonian captivity is blighted by it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010">Eze 17:10</a>).

 <p>One
 </p><p>Representing the whole body.
 </p><p>Friend (ἑταῖρε)
 </p><p>Lit., companion, comrade. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#014">Matthew 20:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mat 20:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Take (ἆρον)
 </p><p>Lit., as Rev., take up, as if the money had been laid down for him on a table or counter.
 </p><p>I will give (θέλω δοῦναι)
 </p><p>But, as in other cases in the A. V., this may be mistaken for the simple future of the verb; whereas there are two verbs. Therefore, Rev., rightly, It is my will to give. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032">Mat 15:32</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021">Matthew 20:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mat 20:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Grant (εἰπὲ)
 </p><p>Lit., speak; i.e., with authority. Compare "command these stones," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003">Mat 4:3</a>; "bid you," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003">Mat 23:3</a>. Rev., command.

 <p>Will be great (θέλῃ εἶναι)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#014">Mat 20:14</a>. Rev. would be.
 </p><p>Minister (διάκονος) Servant, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#027">Mat 20:27</a> (δοῦλος)
 </p><p>Δοῦλος, perhaps from δέω, to bind, is the bondman, representing the permanent relation of servitude. Διάκονος, probably from the same root as διώκω, to pursue, represents a servant, not in his relation, but in his activity. The term covers both slaves and hired servants. The attendants at the feast at Cana (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005">Joh 2:5</a>) are called διάικονοι. In the epistles διάκονος is often used specifically for a minister of the Gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005">Co1 3:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">Co2 3:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007">Eph 3:7</a>). The word deacon is, moreover, almost a transcription of it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001">Phi 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008">Ti1 3:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012">Ti1 3:12</a>). It is applied to Phoebe (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001">Rom 16:1</a>).

 <p>A ransom for many
 </p><p>Compare Sophocles, "Oed. Colossians," 488.
 </p><p>"For one soul working in the strength of love
 </p><p>Is mightier than ten thousand to atone."

 <p>That Jesus passed by (ὅτι Ἰησοῦς παράγει)
 </p><p>The ὅτι is equivalent to quotation marks. They heard the crowd cry Jesus, is passing!
