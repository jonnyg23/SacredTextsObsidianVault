 <p>Multitude (ὄχλος)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019">Joh 1:19</a>.
 </p><p>Followed (ἠκολούθει)
 </p><p>Imperfect tense, denoting not merely the following on this occasion, but generally.
 </p><p>Saw (ἑώρων)
 </p><p>Rev., beheld. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>.
 </p><p>His miracles
 </p><p>Omit his. Render, as Rev., the signs.
 </p><p>He did (ἐποίει)
 </p><p>Imperfect, was doing, from time to time. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003">John 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">joh 6:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A mountain (τὸ ὄρος)
 </p><p>Strictly, the mountain. The writer speaks as one familiar with the district.
 </p><p>He sat (ἐκάθητο)
 </p><p>Imperfect: was sitting, when he saw the multitude approaching (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005">Joh 6:5</a>). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004">John 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">joh 6:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A feast (ἡ ἑορτὴ)
 </p><p>With the definite article, the feast; pointing to something well known. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005">John 6:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">joh 6:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Come (ἔρχεται)
 </p><p>Better, is coming. Unto Him (πρός) is rather toward.
 </p><p>Bread (ἄρτους)
 </p><p>Properly, loaves. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001">Mat 4:1</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006">John 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">joh 6:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>To prove (πειράζων)
 </p><p>Literally, proving. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013">Mat 6:13</a>. Wyc., tempting. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#007">John 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joh 6:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Pennyworth (δηναρίων)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002">Mat 20:2</a>. Two hundred pennyworth would represent between thirty and thirty-five dollars.
 </p><p>That every one may take a little
 </p><p>Peculiar to John. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009">John 6:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">joh 6:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>A lad (παιδάριον)
 </p><p>Diminutive. Only here in the New Testament. Only John mentions the lad.
 </p><p>Barley (κριθίνους)
 </p><p>A detail peculiar to John. The word occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#013">Joh 6:13</a>. An inferior sort of bread is indicated by the term. Pliny and some of the Jewish writers describe barley as food fit for beasts. Suetonius speaks of a turgid rhetorician as a barley orator, inflated like barley in moisture: and Livy relates how cohorts which had lost their standards were ordered barley for food.
 </p><p>Fishes (ὀψάρια)
 </p><p>The word occurs only here and at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009">Joh 21:9</a>. The Synoptists use ἰχθυές. The A.V., small fishes, is intended to render the diminutive. The word means anything that is eaten with bread, and may apply to meat generally, or to what is eaten with bread as a relish. Homer speaks of an onion as a relish (ὄψον) for drink ("Iliad," 11, 630). The term was applied to fish par excellence. Fish became among the Greeks a chief dainty to gourmands, so that Demosthenes describes a glutton and spendthrift as one who is extravagant in fish.
 </p><p>But what are they among so many?
 </p><p>Peculiar to John, though the idea is implied in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#013">Luk 9:13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#010">John 6:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">joh 6:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Sit down (ἀναπεσεῖν)
 </p><p>Literally, recline.
 </p><p>Grass (χόρτος)
 </p><p>Originally an enclosure. Thus Homer speaks of Peleus offering a sacrifice, αὐλῆς ἐν χόρτῳ, in the enclosure of the court ("Iliad," xi., 774). Hence a feeding-place, and so grass, provender. The sense is merely that of our abstract pasture. Matthew and Mark mention the grass, Mark with the epithet green. Wyc., hay. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#011">John 6:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joh 6:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Given thanks
 </p><p>All the Synoptists relate his looking up to heaven and blessing. Perhaps he used the familiar formula, "Blessed art thou Jehovah our God, King of the world, who causes to come forth bread from the earth."
 </p><p>To the disciples, and the disciples
 </p><p>The best texts omit. Render, as Rev., He distributed to them that were set down.
 </p><p>Likewise of the fishes
 </p><p>So also Mark.
 </p><p>As much as they would
 </p><p>Peculiar to John. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#012">John 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">joh 6:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Fragments (κλάσματα)
 </p><p>From κλάω, to break. Rev., broken pieces.
 </p><p>That remain (περισσεύσαντα)
 </p><p>Rev., remain over. Literally, exceed the necessary supply. Only John gives the Lord's command to collect the fragments, and the reason for it, that nothing be lost. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#013">John 6:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">joh 6:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Baskets (κοφίνους)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020">Mat 14:20</a>. Wyc., coffins.
 </p><p>With the fragments, etc.
 </p><p>John goes into fuller detail than the Synoptists. Mark alone notes the gathering of the remains of the fishes. John also uses ἐγέμισαν, filled, for they took up, or were taken up, of the Synoptists.
 </p><p>Five barley loaves
 </p><p>A detail peculiar to John, emphasizing the identity of the fragments with the original loaves.
 </p><p>Unto them that had eaten (βεβρωκόσιν)
 </p><p>Only here in the New Testament. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014">John 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">joh 6:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That should come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος)
 </p><p>Literally, the one coming. Rev., that cometh. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015">Joh 6:15-21</a>. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022">Mat 14:22-36</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045">Mar 6:45-52</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015">John 6:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">joh 6:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Would come (μέλλουσιν ἔρχεσθαι)
 </p><p>Literally, are about to come.
 </p><p>Take by force (ἁρπάζειν)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012">Mat 11:12</a>.
 </p><p>A king
 </p><p>Better, as Rev., king; over themselves.
 </p><p>Himself alone (αὐτὸς μόνος)
 </p><p>Matthew has κατ' ἰδίαν, privately, and both Matthew and Mark add, to pray. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016">John 6:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">joh 6:16</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Even (ὀψία)
 </p><p>An adjective; ὄψιος, late with ὥρα, hour, understood. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017">John 6:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">joh 6:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Ship (πλοῖον)
 </p><p>Rev., boat. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002">Luk 5:2</a>. The best texts omit the article.
 </p><p>Went (ἤρχοντο)
 </p><p>The imperfect, were going. So Rev.
 </p><p>Capernaum
 </p><p>Mark has Bethsaida.
 </p><p>It was now dark (σκοτία ἤδη ἐγεγόνει)
 </p><p>Literally, darkness had already come on. On darkness, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005">Joh 1:5</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018">John 6:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">joh 6:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Arose (διηγείρετο)
 </p><p>It is lamentable how the A.V. misses the graphic force of these imperfects. Rev., rightly, was rising. Literally, was being awakened. The imperfects convey the sense of gathering danger, and throw into stronger relief the fact of Jesus' appearance. They were going; the darkness had already fallen, the sea was rising, and Jesus had not yet come.
 </p><p>That blew (πνέοντος)
 </p><p>Literally, blowing. That was blowing would be better. John's narrative at this point is more detailed and graphic than the others. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019">John 6:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">joh 6:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Had rowed (ἐληλακότες)
 </p><p>Literally, had driven or propelled (the boat).
 </p><p>Five and twenty, etc.
 </p><p>The lake being about forty furlongs, six miles, at its broadest, they had gone only a little more than half-way.
 </p><p>They see (θεωροῦσι)
 </p><p>Rev., behold; with an intent gaze. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>. Both Luke and John use this word frequently.
 </p><p>Drawing nigh
 </p><p>Literally, becoming nigh. Wyc., to be made next to the boat. Mark adds, He would have passed by them, and Luke that they thought Him a phantom. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021">John 6:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">joh 6:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>They willingly received (ἤθελον λαβεῖν)
 </p><p>Wrong. Rev., correctly, they were willing to receive; after being reassured by His voice. The imperfect denotes a continuous state of feeling, not a mere impulsive and temporary wish.
 </p><p>Immediately (εὐθέως)
 </p><p>Whether Jesus actually entered the boat or not, John does not say. The more natural inference is that he did. Both Matthew and Mark say so. Their immediate and miraculous arrival at the shore was simultaneous either with their entertaining the wish to receive Him, or with His actually coming on board. Only John mentions this incident. Matthew and Mark say that the wind ceased.
 </p><p>They went (ὑπῆγον)
 </p><p>Imperfect: were going. Literally, were going away. The verb has the sense of retiring from something. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067">Joh 6:67</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033">Joh 7:33</a>, on which see note; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#011">Joh 12:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008">Joh 18:8</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022">John 6:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">joh 6:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Which stood (ὁ ἑστηκὼς)
 </p><p>Having remained daring the night near the scene of the miracle, and being there still.
 </p><p>Boat (ποιάριον)
 </p><p>Diminutive: little boat.
 </p><p>That - whereinto His disciples were entered
 </p><p>Omit, and read as Rev., save one. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023">John 6:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">joh 6:23</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Howbeit there came other boats (ἄλλα δὲ ἧλθεν πλοιάρια).
 </p><p>Some editors omit δὲ, howbeit, change ἄλλα, other, into ἀλλὰ, but, and read, but there came boats. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026">John 6:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">joh 6:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The miracles (σημεῖα)
 </p><p>Both the insertion of the definite article and the translation miracles in the A.V. tend to obscure the true sense of the passage. Jesus says: You do not seek me because you saw signs. What you saw in my works was only marvels. You did not see in them tokens of my divine power and mission.
 </p><p>Were filled (ἐχορτάσθητε)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006">Mat 5:6</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016">Luk 15:16</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027">John 6:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">joh 6:27</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Meat (βρῶσιν)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032">Joh 4:32</a>. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019">Mat 6:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020">Mat 6:20</a>, and there only, it is used in the sense of rust, that which eats or corrodes. Similarly, corrode is from rodo, to gnaw.
 </p><p>Him hath God the Father sealed
 </p><p>The Rev. makes the sentence culminate properly in God: "for Him the Father, even God, hath sealed." According to the strict Greek order it is: for Him the Father sealed, even God. On sealed (ἐσφράγισεν) see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033">Joh 3:33</a>. Wyc., betokened Him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028">John 6:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">joh 6:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What shall we do? (τί ποιοῦμεν)
 </p><p>Literally, what do we do? The best texts read ποιῶμεν, what are we to do?
 </p><p>Works
 </p><p>The question is from the legal standpoint, works being regarded as the condition of obtaining the living bread. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029">John 6:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">joh 6:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Believe
 </p><p>Faith is put as a moral act or work. The work of God is to believe. Faith includes all the works which God requires. The Jews' question contemplates numerous works. Jesus' answer directs them to one work. Canon Westcott justly observes that "this simple formula contains the complete solution of the relation of faith and works." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030">John 6:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">joh 6:30</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Therefore
 </p><p>Since He had claimed to be the One sent of God. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031">John 6:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">joh 6:31</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Manna
 </p><p>Properly, the manna, referring to the familiar historic fact. A passage is cited from a Hebrew commentary on Ecclesiastes, as follows: "As the first Redeemer made the manna to descend, as it is written, 'Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you'; so the later Redeemer also shall make the manna to descend, as it is written, 'May there be abundance of corn in the earth.'" 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032">John 6:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">joh 6:32</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Moses gave you not (οὐ Μωσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν)
 </p><p>The antithesis is between Moses and my Father. So Rev., rightly, "it was not Moses that gave you," etc. - "but my Father giveth," etc. Some editors change the perfect tense, δέδωκεν, hath given, to the aorist, ἔδωκεν, gave.
 </p><p>The true bread from heaven (τὸν ἄρτον ἐκ τοῦοὐρανοῦ τὸν ἀληθινόν)
 </p><p>The translation would gain by following the Greek order, "the bread out of heaven, the real bread." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033">John 6:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">joh 6:33</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He which cometh down (ὁ καταβαίνων)
 </p><p>So it may be rendered; but also that which, referring to ἄρτος, bread: and so, better, as Rev., since Jesus does not identify Himself with the bread until <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035">Joh 6:35</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035">John 6:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">joh 6:35</a></font></span></p>
 <p>I am the bread of life
 </p><p>A form of expression peculiar to John. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041">Joh 6:41</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048">Joh 6:48</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051">Joh 6:51</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#007">Joh 10:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009">Joh 10:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011">Joh 10:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014">Joh 10:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025">Joh 11:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006">Joh 14:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001">Joh 15:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005">Joh 15:5</a>.
 </p><p>Cometh - believeth
 </p><p>Faith in its active aspect and in its resting aspect.
 </p><p>Never (οὐ μὴ)
 </p><p>Rather, in nowise, or by no means. Rev., shall not. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036">John 6:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">joh 6:36</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But
 </p><p>Though you have seen as you asked, I repeat what I said to you that you have seen and do not believe. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037">John 6:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">joh 6:37</a></font></span></p>
 <p>All that (πᾶν ὃ)
 </p><p>The neuter singular of the adjective and pronoun. All believers are regarded as one complete whole. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024">Joh 17:24</a>, according to the correct reading, "that which Thou hast given me."
 </p><p>Shall come (ἥξει)
 </p><p>Emphasizing the idea of reaching or arriving.
 </p><p>Cometh (ἐρχόμενον)
 </p><p>A different verb, emphasizing the process of coming. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">John 6:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">joh 6:38</a></font></span></p>
 <p>From heaven (ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ)
 </p><p>But the best texts read ἐκ, from, instead of ἐκ, out of, the idea being rather that of departure (I came down) than of origin. I came down should be as Rev. (I am come down). The tense is the perfect. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039">John 6:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">joh 6:39</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The Father's will
 </p><p>Omit the Father's. Render, the will of Him, etc.
 </p><p>That of all which He hath given me (ἵνα πᾶν ὃ δέδωκέ μοι)
 </p><p>The construction is a peculiar and broken one. All which He hath given, stands alone as an absolute nominative; a very emphatic and impressive mode of statement. Literally it reads, that all which He hath given me I should lose nothing out of it.

 </p><p>The best texts read γὰρ, for. There is a logical connection between the last sentence and the following. The Father's will in preserving and raising up that which he has given to the Son, includes in its fulfillment the believing contemplation of the Son and its issue in eternal life.

 </p><p>The best texts substitute πατρός, you, of my Father.
 </p><p>Seeth (θεωρῶν)
 </p><p>The word is designedly used. The saving vision of Christ is not here seeing, but earnest contemplation. Rev., beholdeth. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>. Compare ye have seen me, and believe not (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036">Joh 6:36</a>).

 <p>Draw (ἑλκύση)
 </p><p>Two words for drawing are found in the New Testament, σύρω and ἑλκύω. The distinction is not habitually observed, and the meanings often overlap. Σύρω is originally to drag or trail along, as a garment or torn slippers. Both words are used of haling to justice. (See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003">Act 8:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006">Act 17:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019">Act 16:19</a>) In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019">Act 14:19</a>, συ.ρω, of dragging Paul's senseless body out of the city at Lystra. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006">Joh 21:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#008">Joh 21:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011">Joh 21:11</a>, both words of drawing the net. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010">Joh 18:10</a>, ἑλκύω, of drawing Peter's sword. One distinction, however, is observed: σύρω is never used of Christ's attraction of men. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044">Joh 6:44</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032">Joh 12:32</a>. Ἑλκύω occurs only once outside of John's writings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019">Act 16:19</a>). Luther says on this passage: "The drawing is not like that of the executioner, who draws the thief up the ladder to the gallows; but it is a gracious allurement, such as that of the man whom everybody loves, and to whom everybody willingly goes."

 </p><p>As contrasted with hearing and learning (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045">Joh 6:45</a>). The Father is not seen immediately, but through the Son.

 </p><p>Of God (παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ)
 </p><p>More correctly, as Rev., from, with an idea of association with: from with God. Παρά is used of procession from a personal object, indicating it generally as the starting-point.

 </p><p>Literally, the bread the living (bread). Wyc., quick bread.
 </p><p>I will give
 </p><p>The ἐγω, I, is emphatic, in contrast with Moses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032">Joh 6:32</a>).

 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a>.

 </p><p>Drink His blood
 </p><p>Appropriate the saving merit of His death. The passover was approaching, and the reference may well have been to the flesh and blood of the paschal lamb.
 </p><p>Have no life in you (οὐκ ἔχετε ζωὴν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς)
 </p><p>Not according to the Greek. Rightly, as Rev., ye have not life in yourselves. All true life must be in Christ. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003">Col 3:3</a>.

 </p><p>Another verb for eating is used. With the exception of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#038">Mat 24:38</a>, it is found only in John, and always in connection with Christ. No special significance can be fairly attached to its use here. It seems to be taken as a current word, and ἔφαγον is resumed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058">Joh 6:58</a>.

 <p>In the synagogue (ἐν συναγωγῇ)
 </p><p>But the definite article is wanting; so that we must either understand in a synagogue, or in an assembly. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002">Jam 2:2</a>. Among the ruins at Tell Hum, the probable site of Capernaum, have been found among the remains of a synagogue a block of stone, perhaps the lintel, carved with the pot of manna, and with a pattern of vine leaves and clusters of grapes. See a full account of these ruins in Thomson's "Land and Book, Central Palestine and Phoenicia," pp. 417-419.

 </p><p>Ascend (ἀναβαίνοντα)
 </p><p>Rev., properly, renders the participle, ascending.

 </p><p>Went back (ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω)

 <p>The twelve
 </p><p>John assumes that the number is known. It is implied in the twelve baskets of fragments. As in so many other instances in this Gospel, facts of the synoptic narrative are taken for granted as familiar.
 </p><p>Will ye also go away? (μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς θέλετε ὑπάγειν)
 </p><p>The interrogative particle μὴ shows that a negative answer is expected. Surely ye will not. Will ye go is not the future tense of the verb to go, but is expressed by two words, do ye will (θέλετε), to go away (ὑπάγειν). Rev., would ye. On the verb to go away, see on they went (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021">Joh 6:21</a>).

 <p>Simon Peter
 </p><p>Assailants of the authenticity of John's Gospel have asserted that it reveals an effort on the part of the writer to claim for the disciple whom Jesus loved a pre-eminence above Peter. The assertion is effectually contradicted by the narrative itself. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042">Joh 1:42</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068">Joh 6:68</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006">Joh 13:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010">Joh 18:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#016">Joh 18:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002">Joh 20:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007">Joh 20:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003">Joh 21:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007">Joh 21:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011">Joh 21:11</a>, and notes on those passages. Peter's replying for the twelve, in this passage, is a case in point.
 </p><p>The words of eternal life (ῥήματα ζωῆς αἰωνίου)
 </p><p>There is no article. Thou hast words. Words of life are words which carry life with them. Compare the phrases bread of life, light of life, water of life, tree of life.

 <p>Are sure (ἐγνώκαμεν)
 </p><p>Literally, have come to know. The order of the words believe and know is reversed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008">Joh 17:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016">Jo1 4:16</a>. In the case of the first disciples, faith, produced by the overpowering impression of Jesus' works and person, preceded intellectual conviction.
 </p><p>That Christ, the Son of the living God
 </p><p>The best texts substitute ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ Θεοῦ, the holy one of God. The other reading has resulted from the attempt to bring Peter's confession here into accord with that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016">Mat 16:16</a>. The two confessions differ in that "here the confession points to the inward character in which the Apostles found the assurance of life; there the confession was of the public office and theocratic person of the Lord" (Westcott).

 <p>A devil (διάβολος)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001">Mat 4:1</a>. The word is an adjective, meaning slanderous, but is almost invariably used in the New Testament as a noun, and with the definite article. The article is wanting only in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008">Pe1 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010">Act 13:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009">Rev 12:9</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002">Rev 20:2</a>.

 <p>Judas Iscariot the son of Simon (Ἱούδαν Σίμωνος Ἱσκαριώτην).
 </p><p>The correct reading is Ἱσκαριώτου, Iscariot, agreeing in the genitive case with Σίμωνος, of Simon. Render, as Rev., Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Iscariot denotes the name of Simon's town: a man of Kerioth. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005">Mat 10:5</a>.
