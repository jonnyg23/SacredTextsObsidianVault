 <p>Behold (ἴδετε)
 </p><p>Lit., behold ye. The plural is peculiar. The usual form is the singular ἴδε or ἰδού. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003">Joh 11:3</a>, etc.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035">Joh 4:35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026">Joh 19:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#027">Joh 19:27</a>. Elsewhere the plural is used of something actually visible (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011">Gal 6:11</a>).
 </p><p>What manner of (ποταπὴν)
 </p><p>The word is of infrequent occurrence in the New Testament, but is found in all the Synoptists and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011">Pe2 3:11</a>. Only here in John's writings. Originally it means from what country or race; then, of what sort or quality. It is used of the quality of both persons and things.
 </p><p>Hath bestowed (δέδωκεν)
 </p><p>Emphasizing the endowment of the receiver. Compare χαρίζομαι, from χάρις grace, favor, which emphasizes the goodwill of the giver. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018">Gal 3:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Phi 2:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029">Phi 1:29</a>.
 </p><p>That (ἵνα)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013">Joh 15:13</a>.
 </p><p>We should be called (κληθῶμεν)
 </p><p>Or, named. As <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023">Mat 2:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013">Mat 21:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013">Luk 1:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031">Luk 1:31</a>, etc. The verb is never used by John of the divine call. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003">Joh 10:3</a>, for καλεῖ calleth, read φωνεῖ.
 </p><p>The sons (τέκνα)
 </p><p>Rev., better, children. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012">Joh 1:12</a>.
 </p><p>And such we are (καὶ ἐσμεν)
 </p><p>Lit., and we are. Added by Rev., according to the best texts. A parenthetical, reflective comment, characteristic of John. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002">Jo1 1:2</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jo1 3:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Beloved
 </p><p>See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007">Jo1 2:7</a>.
 </p><p>Now are we and, etc.
 </p><p>The two thoughts of the present and the future condition of God's children are placed side by side with the simple copula, and, as parts of one thought. Christian condition, now and eternally, centers in the fact of being children of God. In that fact lies the germ of all the possibilities of eternal life.
 </p><p>It doth not yet appear (οὔπω ἐφανερώθη)
 </p><p>Rev., more correctly, it is not yet made manifest. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001">Joh 21:1</a>. The force of the aorist tense is, was never manifested on any occasion.
 </p><p>What we shall be (τί ἐσόμεθα)
 </p><p>"This what suggests something unspeakable, contained in the likeness of God" (Bengel).
 </p><p>But we know
 </p><p>Omit but.
 </p><p>When He shall appear (ἐὰν φανερωθῇ)
 </p><p>Rev., correctly, if He (or it) shall be manifested. We may render either "if it shall be manifested," that is what we shall be; or, "if He," etc. The preceding ἐφανερώθη it is (not yet) made manifest, must, I think, decide us in favor of the rendering it. We are now children of God. It has not been revealed what we shall be, and therefore we do not know. In the absence of such revelation, we know (through our consciousness of childship, through His promise that we shall behold His glory), that if what we shall be were manifested, the essential fact of the glorified condition thus revealed will be likeness to the Lord. This fact we know now as a promise, as a general truth of our future state. The condition of realizing the fact is the manifestation of that glorified state, the revealing of the τί ἐσόμεθα what we shall be; for that manifestation will bring with it the open vision of the Lord. When the what we shall be shall be manifest, it will bring us face to face with Him, and we shall be like Him because we shall see Him as He is.
 </p><p>As He is (καθώς ἐστιν)
 </p><p>Strictly, just as. Rev., even as.
 </p><p>"As long as the festivity
 </p><p>Of Paradise shall be, so long our love
 </p><p>Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.
 </p><p>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardor,
 </p><p>The ardor to the vision; and the vision
 </p><p>Equals what grace it has above its worth.
 </p><p>Dante, "Paradiso," iv., 37-42.

 <p>Every man that hath (πᾶς ὁ ἔχων)
 </p><p>A characteristic form of expression with John, containing "a reference to some who had questioned the application of a general principle in particular cases." Here to some persons who had denied the practical obligation to moral purity involved in their hope. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004">Jo1 3:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006">Jo1 3:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009">Jo1 3:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010">Jo1 3:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015">Jo1 3:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023">Jo1 3:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024">Jo1 3:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007">Jo1 4:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001">Jo1 5:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">Jo1 5:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018">Jo1 5:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009">Jo2 1:9</a>.
 </p><p>Hope
 </p><p>John's only reference to Christian hope. The phrase used here, to have the hope upon one, is unique in the New Testament. Compare ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν "on Him shall the Gentiles hope" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012">Rom 15:12</a>): ἠλπίκαμεν ἐπὶ Θεῷ ζῶντι "we have hoped on the living God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010">Ti1 4:10</a>). On the force of ἔχων, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022">Joh 16:22</a>.
 </p><p>In Him (ἐπ' αὐτῷ)
 </p><p>Ambiguous. Better, as Rev., set on Him.
 </p><p>Purifieth himself (ἁγνίζει ἑαυτόν)
 </p><p>On the verb, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022">Pe1 1:22</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008">Jam 4:8</a>. In the Septuagint used only of ceremonial purification, and so four out of the seven instances in which it occurs in the New Testament (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055">Joh 11:55</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024">Act 21:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026">Act 21:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018">Act 24:18</a>). In the remaining cases, of purifying the heart and the soul (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008">Jam 4:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022">Pe1 1:22</a>). The kindred adjective ἁγνός pure, has a moral signification in every case, as has the noun ἁγότης pureness (only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006">Co2 6:6</a>). Ἁγνισμός purification (only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026">Act 21:26</a>), ceremonial.
 </p><p>He (ἐκεῖνος)
 </p><p>Christ, as always in the Epistle.
 </p><p>Pure (ἁγνός)
 </p><p>See above. Though marking moral and spiritual purity, and that of a very high grade, since it is applied to Christ here, yet it admits the thought of possible temptation or pollution, thus differing from ἅγιος, which means absolutely holy. Hence ἁγνός cannot properly be applied to God, who is ἅγιος; but both may be used of Christ, the latter in virtue of His human perfection.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jo1 3:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Whosoever committeth sin (πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν)
 </p><p>Rev., better, every one that doeth sin. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003">Jo1 3:3</a>, every man that hath, and note the frequent repetition of this form of expression in the present chapter. Compare πᾶς ὁ ἁμαρτάνων whosoever sinneth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006">Jo1 3:6</a>). The phrase to do sin regards sin as something actually realized in its completeness. He that does sin realizes in action the sin (note the article τὴν) that which includes and represents the complete ideal of sin. Compare do righteousness, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029">Jo1 2:29</a>.
 </p><p>Transgresseth also the law (καὶ τὴν ἀνομίαν ποιεῖ)
 </p><p>Rev., more accurately, doeth also lawlessness. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041">Mat 13:41</a>, and the phrase οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν ye that work iniquity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023">Mat 7:23</a>).
 </p><p>For (καὶ)
 </p><p>Rev., correctly, and. This and the preceding clause are coordinated after John's manner.
 </p><p>Is the transgression of the law (ἐστὶν ἡ ἀνομία)
 </p><p>Rev., correctly, is lawlessness. Sin is the violation of the law of our being, the law which includes our threefold relation to God, to the men and things around us, and to ourselves. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014">Jam 1:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017">Jam 4:17</a>.

 </p><p>John's characteristic appeal to Christian knowledge.

 </p><p>Christ, as always in this Epistle. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>.
 </p><p>Was manifested
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001">Joh 21:1</a>. Including Christ's whole life on earth and its consequences. The idea of manifestation here assumes the fact of a previous being. John various terms to describe the incarnation. He conceives it with reference to the Father, as a sending, a mission. Hence ὁ πέμψας με He that sent me (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034">Joh 4:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">Joh 6:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004">Joh 9:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044">Joh 12:44</a>, etc.): ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ the Father that sent me (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037">Joh 5:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#018">Joh 8:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#049">Joh 12:49</a>, etc.): with the verb ἀποστέλλω to send as an envoy, with a commission; God sent (ἀπέστειλεν) His Son (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017">Joh 3:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036">Joh 10:36</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010">Jo1 4:10</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057">Joh 6:57</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029">Joh 7:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018">Joh 17:18</a>). With reference to the Son, as a coming, regarded as a historic fact and as an abiding fact. As a historic event, He came (ἧλθεν, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011">Joh 1:11</a>); this is He that came (ὁ ἐλθὼν, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006">Jo1 5:6</a>). Came forth (ἐξῆλθον; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042">Joh 8:42</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027">Joh 16:27</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028">Joh 16:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008">Joh 17:8</a>). As something abiding in its effects, am come, hath come, is come, marked by the perfect tense: Light is come (ἐλήλυθεν, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019">Joh 3:19</a>). Jesus Christ is come (ἐληλυθότα, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002">Jo1 4:2</a>).

Or with the present tense, as describing a coming realized at the moment: whence I come (ἔρχομαι, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014">Joh 8:14</a>); compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003">Joh 14:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018">Joh 14:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028">Joh 14:28</a>; also Jesus Christ coming (ἐρχόμενον, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007">Jo2 1:7</a>).

 </p><p>In Him is no sin (ἁμαρτία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν)

 <p>Abideth
 </p><p>Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004">Joh 15:4-10</a>. To abide in Christ is more than to be in Him, since it represents a condition maintained by communion with God and by the habitual doing of His will. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006">Jo1 2:6</a>.
 </p><p>Sinneth not
 </p><p>John does not teach that believers do not sin, but is speaking of a character, a habit. Throughout the Epistle he deals with the ideal reality of life in God, in which the love of God and sin exclude each other as light and darkness.

 </p><p>Here the article is wanting, compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007">Jo1 3:7</a>. Righteousness is regarded, not in its completeness, but as bearing a particular character. It will be interesting to follow out the same distinction between the following words with and without the article: ἀμαρτία sin; ἀγάπη love; ζωή life; ἀλήθεια truth.

 <p>Cain who was (Κάΐ́ν ἧν)
 </p><p>Who is not in the Greek. The construction is irregular. Lit., as Rev., not as Cain was of the evil one.
 </p><p>Slew (ἔσφαξεν)
 </p><p>The verb occurs only in John, and only here outside of Revelation. Originally, to slay by cutting the throat; so in Homer, of cattle:
 </p><p>"the suitor train who slay (σφάζουσι)
 </p><p>His flocks and slow-paced beeves with crooked horns."
 </p><p>"Odyssey," i., 92.
 </p><p>To slaughter victims for sacrifice:
 </p><p>"Backward they turned the necks of the fat beeves,
 </p><p>And cut their throats (ἕσφαζαν), and flayed the carcasses."
 </p><p>"Iliad," i., 459.
 </p><p>Thence, generally, to slay or kill.
 </p><p>Wherefore (χάριν τίνος)
 </p><p>Lit., on account of what. Χάριν for the sake of, on account of, is elsewhere placed after the genitive.

 </p><p>Have passed (μεατβεβήκαμεν)
 </p><p>Lit., have passed over.
 </p><p>From death (ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου)
 </p><p>Lit., out of the death. The article marks it as one of the two spheres in which men must be; death or life. The death, the life, present one of those sharp oppositions which are characteristic of the Epistle; as love, hatred; darkness, light; truth, a lie. Ὁ θάνατος the death, occurs in John's Epistles only here and in the next clause. In the Gospel, only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024">Joh 5:24</a>.

 <p>Murderer (ἀθρωποκτόνος)
 </p><p>Manslayer. Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044">Joh 8:44</a>, of the devil.
 </p><p>Hath eternal life, etc.
 </p><p>The contrast is suggestive between the sentiment embodied in this statement and that of Pagan antiquity respecting murder, in the Homeric age, for instance. "With regard to the practice of homicide, the ordinary Greek morality was extremely loose.... Among the Greeks, to have killed a man was considered in the light of misfortune, or, at most, a prudential error, when the perpetrator of the act had come among strangers as a fugitive for protection and hospitality. On the spot, therefore, where the crime occurred, it could stand only as in the nature of a private and civil wrong, and the fine payable was regarded, not (which it might have been) as a mode, however defective, of marking any guilt in the culprit, but as, on the whole, an equitable satisfaction to the wounded feelings of the relatives and friends, or as an actual compensation for the lost services of the dead man. The religion of the age takes no notice of the act whatever" (Gladstone "Homer and the Homeric Age," ii., 436).

 </p><p>Deliberately contemplates. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>. Rev., beholdeth. The only occurrence of the verb in John's Epistles.
 </p><p>Have need (χρείαν ἔχοντα)
 </p><p>Lit., having need. Rev., in need.
 </p><p>Bowels of compassion (τὰ σπλάγχνα)

 <p>Shall assure (πείσομεν)
 </p><p>Two renderings are possible; the primitive meaning persuade (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026">Act 19:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004">Act 17:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011">Co2 5:11</a>); or the secondary and consequent sense, assure, quiet, conciliate (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014">Mat 28:14</a>). Render as A.V., and Rev. as sure. See critical note at the end of the commentary on this Epistle.
 </p><p>Before Him (ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ)
 </p><p>Emphatic, the order being, before Him we shall assure our heart. These words are to be kept in mind as the key-note of what follows. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020">1 John 3:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jo1 3:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater, etc.
 </p><p>A very difficult passage. See critical note as above. Render, as Rev., shall assure our heart before Him whereinsoever our heart condemn us, because God is greater than our heart.
 </p><p>For (ὅτι)
 </p><p>To be rendered not as a conjunction (for, because) but as a relative, in whatsoever or whereinsoever.
 </p><p>Condemn (καταγινώσκῃ)
 </p><p>The word occurs only three times in the New Testament; here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021">Jo1 3:21</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011">Gal 2:11</a>. It signifies (1.) To note accurately, usually in a bad sense. Hence to detect (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#011">Pro 28:11</a>); compare Aristophanes: "Having observed (καταγνοὺς) the foibles of the old man" ("Knights," 46). To form an unfavorable prejudice against. So Herodotus. Datis says to the Delians, "Why are ye fled, O holy men, having judged me (καταγνόντες κατ' ἐμεῦ) in so unfriendly a way?" (vi., 97). (2.) To note judicially: to accuse: to accuse one's self. So Thucydides: "No one, when venturing on a perilous enterprise, ever yet passed a sentence of failure on himself" (καταγνοὺς ἑαυτοῦ μὴ περιέσεσθαι; iii., 45). To give sentence, or condemn. To condemn to death. "Those who had fled they condemned to death" (θάνατον καταγνόντες; Thucydides, vi., 60). To decide a suit against one. So Aristophanes: "You judges have no maintenance if you will not decide against (καταγνώσεσθε) this suit" ("Knights," 1360). In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011">Gal 2:11</a>, it is said of Peter that, because of his concessions to the Jewish ritualists, κατεγνωσμένος ἦν he stood condemned or self-condemned (not as A.V., he was to be blamed). His conduct was its own condemnation. This is the sense in this passage, the internal judgment of conscience.
 </p><p>Because (ὅτι)
 </p><p>This second ὅτι does not appear in the A.V. It is a conjunction.
 </p><p>Greater (μείζων)
 </p><p>Is this superior greatness to be regarded as related to God's judgment, or to His compassion? If to His judgment, the sense is: God who is greater than our heart and knows all things, must not only endorse but emphasize our self-accusation. If our heart condemn, how much more God, who is greater than our heart. If to His compassion, the sense is: when our heart condemns us we shall quiet it with the assurance that we are in the hands of a God who is greater than our heart - who surpasses man in love and compassion no less than in knowledge. This latter sense better suits the whole drift of the discussion. See critical note. There is a play of the words γινώσκει knoweth, and καταγινώσκῃ condemneth, which is untranslatable.
