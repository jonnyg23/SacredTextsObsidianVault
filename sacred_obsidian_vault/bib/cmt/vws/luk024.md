 <p>Very early in the morning (ὄρθρου βαθέως)
 </p><p>Lit., at deep dawn, or the dawn being deep. It is not uncommon in Greek to find βαθύς, deep, used of time; as deep or late evening. Plutarch says of Alexander, that he supped "at deep evening;" i.e., late at night. Philo says that the Hebrews crossed the Red Sea "about deep dawn (as here), while others were yet in bed." So Socrates, in prison, asks Crito the time of day. He replies, ὄρθρος βαθύς, the dawn is deep, i.e. breaking (Plato, "Crito," 43).

 <p>Went with (συνεπορεύετο)
 </p><p>The use of the imperfect here is very beautiful. Jesus drew near while they were absorbed in their talk, and was already walking with them when they observed him. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#017">Luke 24:17</a></p>

 <p>Ye have (ἀντιβάλλετε)
 </p><p>Lit., throw back and forth; exchange.
 </p><p>"Discussed a doubt and tossed it to and fro" (Tennyson).
 </p><p>And are sad (σκυθρωποί)
 </p><p>Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016">Mat 6:16</a>, on which see note. The best texts put the interrogation point after walk, add καὶ ἐστάθησαν, and render, and they stood still, looking sad. So Rev. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018">Luke 24:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">luk 24:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem (σὺ μόνος παροικεῖς Ἰερουσαλὴμ)
 </p><p>Παροικεῖν, to dwell as a stranger, is used in later Greek of strangers who have no rights of citizenship, and no settled home. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Heb 11:9</a>. See on strangers, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001">Pe1 1:1</a>; and compare sojourning, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017">Pe1 1:17</a>. The only of the A. V. is commonly understood adverbially: "Are you nothing but a stranger?" But the emphasis of the question falls there, and the word is an adjective. Render "Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem?" Are you the only one who sojourns as a stranger in Jerusalem, and who does not know, etc. So, nearly, Wyc., Thou alone art a pilgrim in Jerusalem. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019">Luke 24:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">luk 24:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What things (ποῖα)
 </p><p>Lit., "what kind of things." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021">Luke 24:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">luk 24:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Trusted (ἠλπίζομεν)
 </p><p>More correctly, hoped. Imperfect: were hoping all the while.
 </p><p>Should have redeemed
 </p><p>Rev., more correctly, should redeem (λυτροῦσθαι). See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018">Pe1 1:18</a>.
 </p><p>Beside all this (σὺν πᾶσιν τούτοις)
 </p><p>Lit., with all these things: his betrayal and crucifixion, etc.
 </p><p>To-day is the third day (τρίτην ταύτην ἡμέραν ἄγει σήμερον)
 </p><p>The best texts omit to-day. The phrase forms an idiom which cannot be neatly rendered. Literally it is, "He (Christ) is passing (ἄγει) this day as the third." Rev., It is now the third day since, etc. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#022">Luke 24:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">luk 24:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Made us astonished (ἐξέστησαν)
 </p><p>Literally the verb means to put out of place ; and so, to drive one out of his senses. Hence the A. V. is feeble. Rev., better, amazed us.
 </p><p>Early (ὀρθριναὶ)
 </p><p>Lit., early ones. Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16</a>. Compare ὄρθρος, dawn, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001">Luk 24:1</a>.

 <p>That they had seen - which said
 </p><p>Cleopas, absorbed in his story, throws himself back to the time of his interview with the women. Lit., "They came saying that they have seen a vision of angels which say" (λέγουσιν). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025">Luke 24:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">luk 24:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Fools and slow of heart (ἀνόητοι καὶ βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ)
 </p><p>This is an unfortunate translation, in the light of the ordinary, popular use of the word fool. Jesus would never have called those sorrowful disciples fools in that sense. The word is compounded of ἀ, not, and νοέω, which implies, besides seeing, perception of the mind as consequent upon sight. It is therefore equivalent to dull of perception. They had read what the prophets had spoken, but had failed to perceive its application to Christ. While this rebuke relates to the understanding, the following one, slow of heart, goes deeper, and contemplates the region of feeling and moral susceptibility. Your heart is dull and slow to respond to these testimonies of your own prophets. Compare hardiness of heart, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014">Mar 16:14</a>.
 </p><p>All (ἐπὶ πᾶσιν)
 </p><p>Rev., rightly, in all; relying upon (ἐπί) all the utterances of the prophets. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026">Luke 24:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">luk 24:26</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Ought not (οὐχὶ ἔδει)
 </p><p>The A. V. does not convey the precise meaning, which is, that, in the eternal order of things, and in fulfilment of the eternal counsel of God as expressed in the prophecies, it was essentially fitting that Christ should suffer. Rev. is clumsy but correct: behoved it not the Christ to suffer? 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027">Luke 24:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">luk 24:27</a></font></span></p>
 <p>He expounded (διερμήνυεν)
 </p><p>Or interpreted: throughout (διά). Imperfect, he went on interpreting from passage to passage. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028">Luke 24:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">luk 24:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>They went (ἐπορεύοντο)
 </p><p>Imperfect, were going. So Rev,
 </p><p>Made as though (προσεποιήσατο)
 </p><p>The verb means originally to add or attach to; hence to take to one's self what does not belong to him; and so, to pretend; though pretending as implying anything false, does not attach to this act of Jesus. He was going on, and would have gone on but for their invitation. Only here in New Testament.

 <p>They constrained (παρεβιάσαντο)
 </p><p>Contrary to (παρά) his apparent intention of going on. Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#015">Act 16:15</a>.
 </p><p>Is far spent (κέκλικεν)
 </p><p>Lit., has declined. Wyc., is now bowed down. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#030">Luke 24:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">luk 24:30</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And gave (ἐπεδίδου)
 </p><p>A very beautiful use of the imperfect, indicating that while he was in the act of distributing they recognized him. He blessed, and having broken, was giving it to them, when, in an instant, their eyes were opened (aorist tense). 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031">Luke 24:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">luk 24:31</a></font></span></p>
 <p>They knew (ἐπέγνωσαν)
 </p><p>Clearly recognized.
 </p><p>And he vanished out of their sight (αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ' αὐτῶν)
 </p><p>Lit., he, invisible, became away from them. It is not simply, he suddenly departed from them, but he passed away from them invisibly. The ἐγένετο, became, is construed with ἀπ' αὐτῶν, from them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032">Luke 24:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">luk 24:32</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Did not our heart burn - while he talked - opened. (οὐχὶ ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν καιομένη ἦν - ὡς ἐλάλει - διήνοιγεν)
 </p><p>The A. V., as usual, pays no attention to the graphic imperfects here. They are speaking of something which was in progress: "was not our heart burning (finite verb and participle) while he was speaking, and was opening the scriptures?" 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034">Luke 24:34</a></p>
