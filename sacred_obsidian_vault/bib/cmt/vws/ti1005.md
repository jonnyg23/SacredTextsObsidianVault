 <p>Rebuke not an elder (πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς)
 </p><p>The verb N.T.o. olxx. originally to lay on blows; hence to castigate with words. Πρεσβύτερος elder, oP., but frequent in Gospels, Acts, and Revelation. Modern critical opinion has largely abandoned the view that the original Christian polity was an imitation of that of the Synagogue. The secular and religious authorities of the Jewish communities, at least in purely Jewish localities, were the same; a fact which is against the probability that the polity was directly transferred to the Christian church. The prerogatives of the Jewish elders have nothing corresponding with them in extent in the Christian community. Functions which emerge later in the Jewish-Christian communities of Palestine do not exist in the first Palestinian-Christian society. At the most, as Weizscker observes, it could only be a question of borrowing a current name.
 </p><p>Modern criticism compels us, I think, to abandon the view of the identity of Bishop and Presbyter which has obtained such wide acceptance, especially among English scholars, through the discussions of Lightfoot and Hatch. The testimony of Clement of Rome (Ep. ad Corinth.) goes to show that the Bishops (ἡγούμενοι or προηγούμενοι) are distinguished from the Presbyters, and that if the Bishops are apparently designated as Presbyters, it is, because they have been chosen from the body of Presbyters, and have retained the name even when they have ceased to hold office. for this reason deceased Bishops are called Presbyters. In Clement, Presbyters signify a class or estate - members of long standing and approved character, and not office-bearers regularly appointed. Among these the Bishops are to be sought. Bishops are reckoned as Presbyters, not because the Presbyter as such is a Bishop, but because the Bishop as such is a Presbyter. In the Pastorals, Bishops and Deacons are associated without mention of Presbyters (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001">Ti1 3:1-13</a>). Presbyters are referred to in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017">Ti1 5:17-19</a>, but in an entirely different connection. The qualifications of Bishops and Deacons are detailed in the former passage, and the list of qualifications concludes with the statement that this is the ordering of the church as the house of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014">Ti1 5:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015">Ti1 5:15</a>). The offices are exhausted in the description of Bishops and Deacons. Nothing is said of Presbyters until ch. 5, where Timothy's relations to individual church-members are prescribed; and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002">Tit 2:2</a> ff. these members are classified as old men (πρεσβύτας) old women, young men, and servants. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017">Ti1 5:17</a> are mentioned elders who rule well (οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι). Assuming that Presbyters and Bishops were identical, a distinction would thus be implied between two classes of Bishops - those who rule well and those who do not: where as the distinction is obviously between old and honored church-members, collectively considered, forming the presbyterial body, and certain of their number who show their qualifications for appointment as overseers. Presbyters as such are not invested with office. There is no formal act constituting a Presbyter. The Bishops are reckoned among the Elders, but the elders as such are not officers.
 </p><p>Thus are to be explained the allusions to appointed Elders, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005">Tit 1:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023">Act 14:23</a>. Elders are to be appointed as overseers or Bishops, for the overseers must have the qualifications of approved Presbyters. The ordination of Presbyters is the setting apart of Elders to the position of Superintendents. The Presbyterate denotes an honorable and influential estate in the church on the ground of age, duration of church membership, and approved character. Only Bishops are appointed. There is no appointment to the Presbyterate. At the close of Clement's letter to the Corinthians, the qualifications of a Presbyter are indicated in the description of the three commissioners from the Roman church who are the bearers of the letter, and to whom no official title is given. They are old, members of the Roman church from youth, blameless in life, believing, and sober.

 </p><p>N.T.o. Comp. πρεσβύτιδας aged women, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003">Tit 2:3</a>. The word indicates distinction in age merely, although some think that it points to an official position which is further referred to in the following directions concerning widows.

Comp. Sir. 38:1. 'The verb only once in Paul (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002">Eph 6:2</a>, citation), and only here in Pastorals.
 </p><p>Widows (χήρας)
 </p><p>Paul alludes to widows in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008">Co1 7:8</a> only, where he advises them against remarrying. They are mentioned as a class in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001">Act 6:1</a>, in connection with the appointment of the seven. Also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039">Act 9:39</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041">Act 9:41</a>. In the Pastorals they receive special notice, indicating their advance from the position of mere beneficiaries to a quasi-official position in the church. from the very first, the church recognised its obligation to care for their support. A widow, in the East, was peculiarly desolate and helpless. In return for their maintenance certain duties were required of them, such as the care of orphans, sick and prisoners, and they were enrolled in an order, which, however, did not include all of their number who received alms of the church. In Polycarp's Epistle to the Philippians, they are styled "the altar of God." To such an order the references in the Pastorals point. The Fathers, from the end of the second century to the fourth, recognised a class known as πρεσβύτιδες aged women (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003">Tit 2:3</a>), who had oversight of the female church-members and a separate seat in the congregation. The council of Laodicaea abolished this institution, or so modified it that widows no longer held an official relation to the church.
 </p><p>Who are widows indeed (τὰς ὄντως χήρας)
 </p><p>Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005">Ti1 5:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016">Ti1 5:16</a>. Ὄντως verily, truly, twice in Paul, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025">Co1 14:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021">Gal 3:21</a>. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018">Pe2 2:18</a>. Wherever ὄντως is used by Paul or by any other N.T. writer, it is used purely as an adverb (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#047">Luk 23:47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034">Luk 24:34</a>): but in all the four instances in the Pastorals, it is preceded by the article and converted into an adjective. The meaning is, who are absolutely bereaved, without children or relations (comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004">Ti1 5:4</a>), and have been but once married. There is probably also an implied contrast with those described in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006">Ti1 5:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011">Ti1 5:11-13</a>.

 <p>Nephews (ἔκγονα)
 </p><p>N.T.o. Often in lxx. Nephews, in the now obsolete sense of grandsons or other lineal descendants. Derived from Lat. nepos. Trench (Select Glossary) remarks that nephew was undergone exactly the same change of meaning that nepos underwent, which, in the Augustan age, meaning grandson, in the post-Augustan age acquired the signification of nephew in our present acceptation of that word. Chaucer:
 </p><p>"How that my nevew shall my bane be."
 </p><p>Legend of Good Women, 2659.
 </p><p>'His (Jove's) blind nevew Cupido."
 </p><p>House of Fame, 67.
 </p><p>Jeremy Taylor: "Nephews are very often liken to their grandfathers than to their fathers."
 </p><p>Let them learn
 </p><p>The subject is the children and grandchildren. Holtzmann thinks the subject is any widow, used collectively. But the writer is treating of what should be done to the widow, not of what she is to do. The admonition is connected with widows indeed. They, as being utterly bereft, and without natural supporters, are to be cared for by the church; but if they have children or grandchildren, these should assume their maintenance.
 </p><p>First (πρῶτον)
 </p><p>In the first place: as their first and natural obligation.
 </p><p>To show piety at home (τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν)
 </p><p>More correctly, to show piety toward their own family. Piety in the sense of filial respect, though not to the exclusion of the religious sense. The Lat. pietas includes alike love and duty to the gods and to parents. Thus Virgil's familiar designation of Aeneas, "pius Aeneas," as describing at once his reverence for the gods and his filial devotion. The verb εὐσεβεῖν (only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023">Act 17:23</a>) represents filial respect as an element of godliness (εὐσέβεια). For τὸν ἴδιον their own, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007">Act 1:7</a>. It emphasizes their private, personal belonging, and contrasts the assistance given by them with that furnished by the church. It has been suggested that οἶκον household or family may mark the duty as an act of family feeling and honor.
 </p><p>To requite (ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι)
 </p><p>An entirely unique expression. Ἁμοιβή requital, recompense is a familiar classical word, used with διδόναι to give, ἀποτιθέναι to lay down, τίνειν to pay, ποιεῖσθαι to make. N.T.o. Paul uses instead ἀντιμισθία (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027">Rom 1:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013">Co2 6:13</a>), or ἀνταπόδομα, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009">Rom 11:9</a>), or ἀνταπόδοσις (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024">Col 3:24</a>). The last two are lxx words.
 </p><p>Their parents (τοῖς προγόνοις)
 </p><p>N.T.o. Parents is too limited. The word comprehends mothers and grandmothers and living ancestors generally. The word for parents is γονεῖς, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002">Ti2 3:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030">Rom 1:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014">Co2 12:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001">Eph 6:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020">Col 3:20</a>. Πρόγονοι for living ancestors is contrary to usage. One instance is cited from Plato, Laws, xi. 932. The word is probably selected to correspond in form with ἔκγονα children.
 </p><p>Good and acceptable (καλὸν καὶ ἀποδεκτὸν)
 </p><p>Omit καλὸν καὶ good and. Ἁπόδεκτος acceptable only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003">Ti1 2:3</a>. See note.
 </p><p>Before (ἐνώπιον)
 </p><p>Frequent in N.T., especially Luke and Revelation. It occurs 31 times in the phrases ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ in the sight of God, and ἐνώπιον κυρίου in the sight of the Lord. olxx. Comp. ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ before God. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004">Act 10:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019">Th1 2:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009">Th1 3:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013">Th1 3:13</a>. Not in Pastorals, and by Paul only 1 Thessalonians the difference is trifling. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019">Jo1 3:19</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022">Jo1 3:22</a>.

 </p><p>He hath denied the faith (τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται)
 </p><p>The verb not in Paul, but Quite often in Pastorals. The phrase only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013">Rev 2:13</a>. Faith demands works and fruits. By refusing the natural duties which Christian faith implies, one practically denies his possession of faith. Faith does not abolish natural duties, but perfects and strengthens them" (Bengel).

 </p><p>A mark of Oriental hospitality bestowed on the stranger arriving from a journey, and therefore closely associated with lodged strangers.
 </p><p>Of the saints (ἁγίων)
 </p><p>Ἅγιος is rare in Class. In lxx, the standard word for holy. Its fundamental idea is setting apart, as in Class., devoted to the gods. In O.T., set apart to God, as priests; as the Israelites consecrated to God. In N.T., applied to Christians. Ideally, it implies personal holiness. It is used of God, Christ, John the Baptist, God's law, the Spirit of God. Paul often uses οἱ ἅγιοι as a common designation of Christians belonging to a certain region or community, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001">Phi 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001">Co2 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002">Col 1:2</a>. In such cases it does not imply actual holiness, but holiness obligatory upon those addressed, as consecrated persons, and appropriate to them. What ought to be is assumed as being. In this sense not in the Gospels (unless, possibly, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052">Mat 27:52</a>) or in the Epistles of Peter and John. Rare in Acts.

 </p><p>This is the only instance in the Pastorals in which the Christ is used without Jesus either before or after. In Paul this is common, both with and without the article.
 </p><p>They will marry (γαμεῖν θέλουσιν)
 </p><p>Better, they are bent on marrying, or determined to marry. The strong expression wax wanton makes it probable that θέλειν expresses more than a desire, as Rev. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019">Mat 1:19</a>. Γαμεῖν to marry, in the active voice, of the wife, as everywhere in N.T. except <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039">Co1 7:39</a>.

 <p>Having damnation (ἔχουσαι κρίμα)
 </p><p>The phrase only here. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006">Ti1 3:6</a>. Damnation is an unfortunate rendering in the light of the present common understanding of the word, as it is also in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029">Co1 11:29</a>. Better, judgment or condemnation, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008">Rom 3:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#002">Rom 13:2</a>. The meaning is that they carry about with them in their new, married life a condemnation, a continuous reproach. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002">Ti1 4:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010">Gal 5:10</a>. It should be said for the translators of 1611 that they used damnation in this sense of, judgment or condemnation, as is shown by the present participle having. In its earlier usage the word implied no allusion to a future punishment. Thus Chaucer
 </p><p>"For wel thou woost (knowest) thyselven verraily
 </p><p>That thou and I be dampned to prisoun."
 </p><p>Knight's T. 1175.
 </p><p>Wiclif: "Nethir thou dredist God, that thou art in the same dampnacioun?" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#040">Luk 23:40</a>. Laud.: "Pope Alexander III. condemned Peter Lombard of heresy, and he lay under that damnation for thirty and six years." "A legacy by damnation" was one in which the testator imposed on his heir an obligation to give the legatee the thing bequeathed, and which afforded the legatee a personal claim against the heir.
 </p><p>They have cast off their first faith (τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν)
 </p><p>Ἁθετεῖν is to set aside, do away with, reject or slight. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026">Mar 6:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016">Luk 10:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028">Heb 10:28</a>. Often in lxx. Πίστιν is pledge: so frequently in Class. with give and receive. See, for instance, Plato, Phaedr. 256 D. In lxx, 3 Macc. 3:10. The phrase πίστιν ἀθετεῖν N.T.o. olxx. There are, however, a number of expressions closely akin to it, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015">Gal 3:15</a>, διαθήκην ἀθετεῖν to render a covenant void. In lxx with oath, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013">Ch2 36:13</a>. Psalm 14:4: "He that sweareth to his neighbor καὶ οὐκ ἀθετῶν." Psalm 88:34; 131:11; 1 Macc. 6:62. The meaning here is, having broken their first pledge; and this may refer to a pledge to devote themselves, after they became widows, to the service of Christ and the church. The whole matter is obscure.

 </p><p>Double honor (διπλῆς τιμῆς)

An analogy to the O.T. injunction may be found in the laws giving to the Athenians by the mythical Triptolemus, one of which was, "Hurt not the laboring beast." Some one having violated this command by slaying a steer which was eating the sacred cake that lay upon the altar, - an expiation-feast, Bouphonia or Diipolta was instituted for the purpose of atoning for this offense, and continued to be celebrated in Athens. Aristophanes refers to it (Clouds, 985). A laboring ox was led to the altar of Zeus on the Acropolis, which was strewn with wheat and barley. As soon as the ox touched the grain, he was killed by a blow from an axe. The priest who struck the blow threw away the axe and fled. The flesh of the ox was then eaten, and the hide was stuffed and set before the plough. Then began the steer-trial before a judicial assembly in the Prytaneum, by which the axe was formally condemned to be thrown into the sea.
 </p><p>The laborer is worthy, etc.
 </p><p>A second scriptural quotation would seem to be indicated, but there is no corresponding passage in the O.T. The words are found <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007">Luk 10:7</a>, and, with a slight variation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010">Mat 10:10</a>. Some hold that the writer adds to the O.T. citation a popular proverb, and that Christ himself used the words in this way. But while different passages of Scripture are often connected in citation by καὶ, it is not according, to N.T. usage thus to connect Scripture and proverb. Moreover, in such series of citations it is customary to use καὶ πάλιν and again, or πάλιν simply. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007">Mat 4:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033">Mat 5:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039">Joh 12:39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009">Rom 15:9-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020">Co1 3:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005">Heb 1:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013">Heb 2:13</a>. According to others, the writer here cites an utterance of Christ from oral tradition, coordinately with the O.T. citation, as Scripture. Paul, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015">Th1 4:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010">Co1 7:10</a>, appeals to a word of the Lord; and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035">Act 10:35</a> he is represented as quoting "it is more blessed to give than to receive" as the words of Jesus. In 1 Corinthians 9, in the discussion of this passage from Deuteronomy, Paul adds (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014">Co1 9:14</a>) "even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel," which resembles the combination here. This last is the more probable explanation.

 <p>Drink no longer water (μηκέτι ὑδροπότει)
 </p><p>The verb N.T.o. olxx. Rend. be no longer a drinker of water. Timothy is not enjoined to abstain from water, but is bidden not to be a water-drinker, entirely abstaining from wine. The kindred noun ὑδροπότης is used by Greek comic writers to denote a mean-spirited person. See Aristoph. Knights, 319.
 </p><p>But use a little wine (ἀλλὰ οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ χρῶ)
 </p><p>The reverse antithesis appears in Hdt. i. 171, of the Persians: οὐκ οἴνῳ διαχρέονται ἀλλ' ὑδροποτέουσι they do not indulge in wine but are water-drinkers. Comp. Plato, Repub. 561 C, τοτὲ μεν μεθύων - αὖθις δὲ ὑδροποτῶν sometimes he is drunk - then he is for total-abstinence. With a little wine comp. much wine, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008">Ti1 3:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003">Tit 2:3</a>.
 </p><p>For thy stomach's sake (διὰ στόμαχον)
 </p><p>Στόμαχος N.T.o. olxx. The appearance at this point of this dietetic prescription, if it is nothing more, is sufficiently startling; which has led to some question whether the verse may not have been misplaced. If it belongs here, it can be explained only as a continuation of the thought in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022">Ti1 5:22</a>, to the effect that Timothy is to keep himself pure by not giving aid and comfort to the ascetics, and imperilling his own health by adopting their rules of abstinence. Observe that οἶνος here, as everywhere else, means wine, fermented and capable of intoxicating, and not a sweet syrup made by boiling down grape-juice, and styled by certain modern reformers "unfermented wine." Such a concoction would have tended rather to aggravate than to relieve Timothy's stomachic or other infirmities.
 </p><p>Thine often infirmities (τὰς πυκνάς σου ἀσθενείας)
 </p><p>This use of often as an adjective appears in earlier English. So Chaucer: "Ofte sythes" or "tymes ofte," many times. Shakespeare: "In which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness" (As you like it, IV. i. 19). And
 </p><p>Ben Jonson:
 </p><p>"The jolly wassal walks the often round."
 </p><p>The Forest, iii.
 </p><p>Even Tennyson:
 </p><p>"Wrench'd or broken limb - an often chance
 </p><p>In those brain-stunning shocks and tourney-falls."
 </p><p>Gareth and Lynette.
 </p><p>Πυκνός often, very common in Class. Originally, close, compact, comp. Lat. frequens. In this sense 3 Macc. 4:10, τῷ πυκνῷ σανιδώματι the close planking of a ship's deck. In N.T., except here, always adverbial, πυκνὰ or πυκνότερον often or oftener, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033">Luk 5:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026">Act 24:26</a>. Ἁσθένεια weakness, infirmity, only here in Pastorals. In the physical sense, as here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015">Luk 5:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002">Luk 8:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#005">Joh 5:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013">Gal 4:13</a>. In the ethic sense, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019">Rom 6:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026">Rom 8:26</a>.

 <p>Open beforehand (προδηλοί)
 </p><p>A.V. wrong in giving πρὸ a temporal force, whereas it merely strengthens δηλοί evident, manifest. The meaning is openly manifested to all eyes. In N.T. only here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#025">Ti1 5:25</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014">Heb 7:14</a>. In lxx, see Judith 8:29; 2 Macc. 3:17; 14:39.
 </p><p>Going before to judgment (προάγουσαι εἰς κρίσιν)
 </p><p>Προάγειν, oP. In N.T. habitually with a local meaning, either intransitive, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#009">Mat 2:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022">Mat 14:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#009">Mar 11:9</a>; or transitive, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006">Act 12:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005">Act 17:5</a>. The meaning here is that these open sins go before their perpetrator to the judgment-seat like heralds, proclaiming their sentence in advance. Κρίσιν, not specifically of the judgment of men or of the final judgment of God, or of the sentence of an ecclesiastical court - but indefinitely. The writer would say: no judicial utterance is necessary to condemn them of these sins. The word in Paul, only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005">Th2 1:5</a>.
 </p><p>They follow after (ἐπακολουθοῦσιν)
 </p><p>The verb only here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024">Ti1 5:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021">Pe1 2:21</a>, and (the disputed) <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020">Mar 16:20</a>. The sins follow up the offender to the bar of judgment, and are first made openly manifest there.

 <p>Otherwise (ἅλλως)
 </p><p>N.T.o. Not, otherwise than good, but otherwise than manifest.
 </p><p>Be hid (κρυβῆναι)
 </p><p>In Paul only <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003">Col 3:3</a>. The good works, although not conspicuous (πρόδηλα), cannot be entirely concealed. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mat 5:14-16</a>. It has been suggested that these words may have been intended to comfort Timothy in his possible discouragement from his "often infirmities." von Soden thinks they were meant to encourage him against the suspicion awakened by his use of wine. By persevering in his temperate habits (οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ) it will become manifest that he is no wine-bibber.
