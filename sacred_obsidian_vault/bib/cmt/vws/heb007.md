 <p>For this Melchisedec, etc.
 </p><p>See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018">Gen 14:18-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001">Psa 110:1-7</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#002">Hebrews 7:2</a></p>

 <p>First being by interpretation King of righteousness (πρῶτον μὲν ἑρμηνευόμενος βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης)
 </p><p>The first designation is the literal interpretation of the Hebrew name. Being interpreted belongs only to this designation. So Joseph Ant. 1:10, 2: σημαίνει δε τοῦτο βασιλεὺς δίκαιος "and this (the name Melchisedec) signifies righteous king."
 </p><p>And after that also (ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ)
 </p><p>Then follows a designation derived from his character, king of peace. Supply being; not being interpreted.
 </p><p>Salem
 </p><p>Commonly regarded as the site of Jerusalem. It has also been supposed to represent Σαλείμ Salim, mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023">Joh 3:23</a>. Jerome says that the place retained that name in his day, and that the ruins of Melchisedec's palace were shown there. The ancient name of Jerusalem was Jebus. Others, again, suppose that Salem is not the name of a place, but is merely the appellation of Melchisedec. The passage in Genesis, however, points to a place, and the writer might naturally have desired to indicate the typical meaning of the city over which Melchisedec reigned. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003">Hebrews 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">heb 7:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Without father, without mother, without descent (ἀπάτωρ, ἀμὴτωρ, ἀγενεαλόγητος)
 </p><p>The three adjectives N.T.o, olxx. The meaning is that there is no record concerning his parentage. This is significant as indicating a different type of priesthood from the Levitical, in which genealogy was of prime importance. No man might exercise priestly functions who was not of the lineage of Aaron.
 </p><p>Having neither beginning of days nor end of life
 </p><p>That is to say, history is silent concerning his birth and death.
 </p><p>But made like unto the Son of God (ἀφωμοιωμένος δὲ τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ θεοῦ)
 </p><p>The verb N.T.o. Made like or likened, not like. "The resemblance lies in the Biblical representation, and not primarily in Melchisedec himself" (Westcott). Son of God, not Son of man, for the likeness to Jesus as Son of man would not hold; Jesus, as man, having had both birth and death. The words likened unto the Son of God stand independently. Not to be connected with the following sentence, so as to read abideth a priest continually like the Son of God; for, as a priest, Melchisedec, chronologically, was prior to Christ; and, therefore, it is not likeness with respect to priesthood that is asserted. The likeness is in respect to the things just predicated of Melchisedec. Christ as Son of God was without father, mother, beginning or end of days; and, in these points, Melchisedec is likened in Scripture to him.
 </p><p>Abideth a priest continually (μένει ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸ διηνεκές)
 </p><p>Διηνεκής from διαφέρειν to bear through; born on through ages, continuous. Only in Hebrews. There is no historical account of the termination of Melchisedec's priesthood. The tenure of his office is uninterrupted. The emphasis is on the eternal duration of the ideal priesthood, and the writer explains the Psalm as asserting eternal duration as the mark of the Melchisedec order. Accordingly, he presents the following characteristics of the ideal priesthood: royal, righteous, peace-promoting, personal and not inherited, eternal. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isa 11:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017">Isa 32:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007">Isa 53:7</a>. It is, of course, evident to the most superficial reader that such exposition of O.T. scripture is entirely artificial, and that it amounts to nothing as proof of the writer's position. Melchisedec is not shown to be an eternal high priest because his death-record is lost; nor to be properly likened unto the Son of God because there is no notice of his birth and parentage.

 <p>The superiority of the Melchisedec priesthood to the Levitical.
 </p><p>Consider (θεωρεῖτε)
 </p><p>Only here in Hebrews and oP. Except this passage, confined to the Synoptic Gospels, Acts, and Johannine writings. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018">Luk 10:18</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>.

 </p><p>The patriarch (ὁ πατριάρχης)
 </p><p>Only here and in Acts.
 </p><p>The tenth (δεκάτην)
 </p><p>Properly an adjective, but used as a noun for tithe. Only in Hebrews, as is the kindred verb δεκατοῦν to impose or take tithes. Ἀποδεκατοῖν to exact tithes, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005">Heb 7:5</a>. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023">Mat 23:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042">Luk 11:42</a>.
 </p><p>Of the spoils (ἐκ τῶν ἀκροθινίων)
 </p><p>The noun N.T.o , from ἅρκον topmost point, and θίς a heap. The top of the pile: the "pick" of the spoil. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005">Hebrews 7:5</a></p>

 <p>If Melchisedec was greater than Abraham, he was greater than Abraham's descendants, including the tribe of Levi.
 </p><p>They that are of the sons of Levi who receive, etc. (οἱ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Λευεὶ λαμβάνοντες)
 </p><p>Those out of the sons of Levi who become priests. Not those who receive the priesthood from the sons of Levi. Not all Levites were priests, but only those of the house of Aaron.
 </p><p>The office of the priesthood (τὴν ἱερατίαν)
 </p><p>Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009">Luk 1:9</a>.
 </p><p>A commandment (ἐντολὴν)
 </p><p>A special injunction. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008">Jam 2:8</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</a>.
 </p><p>To take tithes (ἀποδεκατοῖν)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004">Heb 7:4</a>.
 </p><p>That is of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham
 </p><p>The people, the brethren of the Levites, are descended from their common ancestor, Abraham, yet the Levites exact tithes from them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006">Hebrews 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">heb 7:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But he whose descent is not counted from them (ὁ δὲ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν)
 </p><p>Lit. he who is not genealogically derived from them: Melchisedec. The verb N.T.o.
 </p><p>Received tithes of Abraham
 </p><p>Melchisedec, who has no part in the Levitical genealogy, and therefore no legal right to exact tithes, took tithes from the patriarch himself. Hence he was greater than Abraham. The right of the Levitical priest to receive tithes was only a legal right, conferred by special statute, and therefore implied no intrinsic superiority to his brethren; but Melchisedec, though having no legal right, received tithes from Abraham as a voluntary gift, which implied Abraham's recognition of his personal greatness.
 </p><p>And hath blessed him that had the promises
 </p><p>Melchisedec accepted the position accorded to him by Abraham's gift of tithes by bestowing on Abraham his blessing, and Abraham recognized his superiority by accepting his blessing. He who had received the divine promises might have been supposed to be above being blessed by any man. The significance of this acceptance is brought out in the next verse. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007">Hebrews 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">heb 7:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Without all contradiction (χωρὶς πάσης ἀντιλογίας)
 </p><p>Asserting a principle which no one thinks of questioning: it is the less who is blessed, and the greater who blesses. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008">Hebrews 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">heb 7:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Here (ὧδε)
 </p><p>In the Levitical economy.
 </p><p>Men that die receive tithes
 </p><p>The emphasis is on ἀποθνήσκοντες dying. The Levites are dying men, who pass away in due course, and are succeeded by others.
 </p><p>But there (ἐκεῖ δὲ)
 </p><p>In the case of Melchisedec.
 </p><p>(He receiveth them of whom) it is witnessed that he liveth (μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ)
 </p><p>The Greek is very condensed: being attested that he liveth. The A.V. fills it out correctly. Melchisedec does not appear in Scripture as one who dies, and whose office passes to another. See on abideth continually, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003">Heb 7:3</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#009">Hebrews 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">heb 7:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Levi himself, in the person of Abraham, was tithed by Melchisedec.
 </p><p>As I may say (ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν)
 </p><p>= so to speak. N.T.o. olxx. Introducing an unusual statement, or one which may appear paradoxical or startling to the reader, as this statement certainly is, to a modern reader at least.
 </p><p>In Abraham (δι' Ἀβραὰμ)
 </p><p>Lit. through Abraham.

 <p>In the loins of his father (ἐν τῇ ὀσφύΐ τοῦ πατρὸς)
 </p><p>His own father; not of Abraham.
 </p><p>When Melchisedec met him
 </p><p>In the person of Abraham. The whole Jewish law, its ordinances and priesthood, are regarded as potentially in Abraham. When Abraham paid tithes, Levi paid tithes. When Abraham was blessed, Israel was blessed. It is a kind of reasoning which would appeal to Hebrews, who so strongly emphasized the solidarity of their race. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004">Rom 9:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005">Rom 9:5</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">heb 7:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>In Christ, as the Melchisedec-priest, the ideal of the priesthood is realized.
 </p><p>Perfection (τελείωσις)
 </p><p>Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#045">Luk 1:45</a>. The act or process of consummating. By this word is signified the establishment of a perfect fellowship between God and the worshipper. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009">Heb 9:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001">Heb 10:1</a>.
 </p><p>Priesthood (ἱερωσύνης)
 </p><p>Only in Hebrews. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012">Heb 7:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014">Heb 7:14</a>. It expresses the abstract notion of the priest's office; while ἱερατία <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005">Heb 7:5</a>, expresses the priestly service.
 </p><p>For under it the people received the law (γὰρ ἐπ' αὐτῆς νενομοθέτηται)
 </p><p>Under, rather on the basis of. The verb lit. the law has been laid down. Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006">Heb 8:6</a>.
 </p><p>What further need (τίς ἔτι χρεία)
 </p><p>Ἔτι after that, assuming that there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood.
 </p><p>Another priest (ἕτερον ἱερέα)
 </p><p>Not merely another, but a different kind of priest. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mat 6:24</a>.
 </p><p>Should rise (ἀνίστασθαι)
 </p><p>In Hebrews only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015">Heb 7:15</a>, both times in connection with priest.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">heb 7:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Being changed (μετατιθεμένης)
 </p><p>Or transferred to another order. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006">Gal 1:6</a>.
 </p><p>A change (μετάθεσις)
 </p><p>A transfer to a new basis. Only in Hebrews. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005">Heb 11:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027">Heb 12:27</a>. The inferiority of the Levitical priesthood is inferred from the fact that another priesthood was promised. If perfection was possible at all under the Mosaic economy, it must come through the Levitical priesthood, since that priesthood was, in a sense, the basis of the law. The whole legal system centered in it. The fundamental idea of the law was that of a people united with God. Sin, the obstacle to this ideal union, was dealt with through the priesthood. If the law failed to effect complete fellowship with God, the priesthood was shown to be a failure, and must be abolished; and the change of the priesthood involved the abolition of the entire legal system. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#013">Hebrews 7:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">heb 7:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>As the law prescribed that the priesthood should be of the order of Aaron, a new priesthood, not of that order, must set aside the law.
 </p><p>Pertaineth to another tribe (φυλῆς ἑτέρας μετέσχηκεν)
 </p><p>Lit. hath partaken of another tribe. Not only another, but a different tribe; one not specially set apart to sacerdotal service.

 <p>The law of a carnal commandment (νόμον ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης)
 </p><p>The phrase N.T.o. Νόμον the norm or standard, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#021">Rom 7:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023">Rom 7:23</a>. Εντολῆς, the specific precept of the Mosaic law regarding Levitical priests. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</a>. Σαρκίνης fleshly, indicates that the conditions of the Levitical priesthood had reference to the body. Fitness for office was determined largely by physical considerations. The priest must be of proper descent, without bodily blemish, ceremonially pure. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001">Heb 9:1-5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010">Heb 9:10</a>, and comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003">Rom 8:3</a>.

Jesus was high priest in virtue of the energy of indissoluble life which dwelt in him, unlike the priests who die, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008">Heb 7:8</a>. This truth the writer finds in the Psalm.

 <p>There is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before (ἀθέτησις μὲν γὰρ γίνεται προαγούσης ἐντολῆς)
 </p><p>Verily is superfluous. Ἀθέτησις only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026">Heb 9:26</a>; a very few times in lxx: The fundamental idea is the doing away of something established (θετόν). The verb ἀθετεῖν to make void, do away with, is common in N.T. and in lxx, where it represents fifteen different Hebrew words, meaning to deal falsely, to make merchandise of, to abhor, to transgress, to rebel, to break an oath, etc. The noun, in a technical, legal sense, is found in a number of papyri from 98 to 271 a.d., meaning the making void of a document. It appears in the formula εἰς ἀθίτησιν καὶ ἀκύρωσιν for annulling and canceling. Προαγούσης ἐντολῆς rend. of a foregoing commandment. The expression is indefinite, applying to any commandment which might be superseded, although the commandment in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016">Heb 7:16</a> is probably in the writer's mind. Foregoing, not emphasizing mere precedence in time, but rather the preliminary character of the commandment as destined to be done away by a later ordinance. With foregoing comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018">Ti1 1:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024">Ti1 5:24</a>.

See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Rom 5:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003">Rom 8:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021">Gal 3:21</a>.

 <p>For the law made nothing perfect (οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐτελείωσεν ὁ νόμος)
 </p><p>Parenthetical. The A.V. overlooks the parenthesis, ignores the connection of bringing in with disannulling, translates δὲ but instead of and, and supplies did; thus making an opposition between the law which made nothing perfect and the bringing in of a better hope, which did make something perfect. What the writer means to say is that, according to the Psalm, there takes place, on the one hand, a disannulling of the preliminary commandment because it was weak and unprofitable, unable to perfect anything, and on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope.
 </p><p>The bringing in of a better hope (ἐπεισαγωγὴ κρείττονος ἐλπίδος)
 </p><p>ΕπεισαγωγὴN.T.o, olxx, is "a bringing in upon" (ἐπὶ), upon the ground formerly occupied by the commandment. So Rev., correctly, "a bringing in thereupon." For κπείττων better, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004">Heb 1:4</a>. The comparison is not between the hope conveyed by the commandment, and the better hope introduced by the gospel, but between the commandment which was characteristic of the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</a>) and the hope which characterized the gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2-5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</a>).
 </p><p>By the which we draw nigh to God (δι' ἧς ἐγγίζομεν τῷ θεῷ)
 </p><p>Giving the reason why the hope is better. Christianity is the religion of good hope because by it men first enter into intimate fellowship with God. The old priesthood could not effect this.

 <p>Not without an oath (οὐ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας)
 </p><p>The A.V. is, on the whole, better than Rev. by inserting he was made priest. Ὁρκωμοσία only in Hebrews. In lxx see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018">Eze 17:18</a>; 1 Esdr. 9:93. For an oath rend. the taking of an oath.

 <p>For those priests were made (οἱ μὲν γὰρ - εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες)
 </p><p>Rend. for they have been made priests. Lit. are priests, having become such.
 </p><p>Without an oath
 </p><p>Without the taking of an oath by God. Scripture says nothing of an oath of God when he appointed Aaron and his posterity to the priesthood.
 </p><p>But this with an oath (ὁ δὲ μετὰ ὁρκωμοσίας)
 </p><p>Rend. but he with the taking of an oath. The taking of the oath accompanied (μετὰ) the inauguration into the priesthood.
 </p><p>That said (λέγοντος)
 </p><p>Better, saith. Still says, since the promise is realized in Christ's priesthood.

 <p>Was Jesus made a surety of a better testament (κρείττονος διαθήκης γέγονεν ἔγγυος Ἰησοῦς)
 </p><p>Ἔγγυος surety, N.T.o. Comp. Sir. 29:15, 16; 2 Macc. 10:28. Occasionally in Class., where also occur ἐγγυᾶν to give as a pledge, ἐγγύη surety, ἐγγύησις giving in surety, ἐγγυητής one who gives security, and ἐγγητός plighted, always of a wife. The idea underlying all these words is that of putting something into one's hand (ἐν in γύαλον hollow of the hand) as a pledge. For testament rend. covenant and see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb 9:16</a>. The thought of a covenant is introduced for the first time, and foreshadows <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006">Heb 8:6-13</a>. It adds to the thought of the inferiority of the Levitical priesthood that of the inferiority of the dispensation which it represented.

 </p><p>Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021">Heb 7:21</a> for the construction. Rend. have been made priests many in number.
 </p><p>Because they were not suffered to continue (διὰ τὸ κωλύεσθαι παραμένειν)
 </p><p>Rend. because they are hindered from continuing. Παραμένειν "to abide by their ministration."

 <p>Hath an unchangeable priesthood (ἀπαράβατον ἔχει τὴν ἱερωσύνην)
 </p><p>Rend. hath his priesthood unchangeable. The A.V. misses the possessive force of the article, his priesthood, and the emphasis is on unchangeable ἀπαράβατος, N.T.o. olxx. This may be explained either as inviolable, or which does not pass over to another. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008">Exo 32:8</a>; Sir. 23:18. Usage is in favor of the former meaning, but the other falls in better with the course of thought.

 <p>To the uttermost (εἰς τὸ παντελὲς)
 </p><p>Παντελής all complete, only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#011">Luk 13:11</a>. Not perpetually, but perfectly.
 </p><p>Come unto God (προσερχομένους τῷ θεῷ)
 </p><p>The verb oP., and in this sense only in Hebrews and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004">Pe1 2:4</a>. See a peculiar usage in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003">Ti1 6:3</a>. Comp. ἐγγίζειν to draw near, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008">Jam 4:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019">Heb 7:19</a>.
 </p><p>To make intercession for them (εἰς τὸ ἐντυγχάνειν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν)
 </p><p>The verb only here in Hebrews. Comp. ὑπερεντυγχάνειν, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026">Rom 8:26</a>, see note. See also on ἐντεύξεις supplications, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001">Ti1 2:1</a>. The idea is not intercession, but intervention. It includes every form of Christ's identifying himself with human interests. The attempt has been made to trace this idea to Philo, who alludes to the λόγος ἱκέτης the supplicant Logos, and the λόγος παράκλητος the advocate-Logos. But the Logos is not treated by Philo as a divine-human personality intervening for men, but as a poetical personification allegorically considered. In one instance the suppliant Logos is the cry of the oppressed Israelites; in another, Moses, as the allegorical representative of the universal reason of mankind. It represents certain functions of human reason and speech. Again, the suppliant is the visible Cosmos striving to realize its ideal.

 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010">Heb 2:10</a>. For the verb see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001">Tit 2:1</a>. There was an essential fitness in the gift of our great high priest. Comp. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017">Heb 2:17</a>.
 </p><p>Holy (ὅσιος)
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075">Luk 1:75</a>. Always with a relation to God; never of moral excellence as related to men.

 <p>Who needeth not daily (καθ' ἡμέραν)
 </p><p>Apparently inconsistent with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007">Heb 9:7</a> : but the sense is, "who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices," etc. The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly.
 </p><p>Once (ἐφάπαξ)
 </p><p>Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily.
 </p><p>When he offered up himself (ἑαυτὸν ανενέγκας)

 <p>Summarizing the contents of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026">Heb 7:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027">Heb 7:27</a>. - The law constitutes weak men high priests. God's sworn declaration constitutes a son, perfected forevermore. Ἀνθρώπους men, many in number as contrasted with one Son. Ἔχοντας ἀσθένειαν having infirmity, stronger than ἀσθενεῖς weak, which might imply only special exhibitions of weakness, while having infirmity indicates a general characteristic. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022">Joh 16:22</a>.
 </p><p>A son
 </p><p>Again the high-priesthood is bound up with sonship, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005">Heb 5:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006">Heb 5:6</a>.
