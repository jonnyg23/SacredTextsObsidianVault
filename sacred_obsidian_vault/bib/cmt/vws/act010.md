 <p>A tanner
 </p><p>Showing that the strictness of the Jewish law was losing its hold on Peter; since the tanner's occupation was regarded as unclean by strict Jews, and the tanners were commanded to dwell apart. "If a tanner married without mentioning his trade, his wife was permitted to get a divorce. The law of levirate marriage might be set aside if the brother-in-law of the childless widow was a tanner. A tanner's yard must be at least fifty cubits from any town" (Farrar, "Life and Work of St. Paul").
 </p><p>By the seaside
 </p><p>Outside the walls, both for proximity to the business, and because of the ceremonial requirement referred to above. Mr. William C. Prime, describing a visit to Joppa, says: "I was walking along the sea-beach, looking for shells, and at about a fourth of a mile from the city, to the southward, I found two tanneries directly on the seaside. I observed that the rocks in front of them were covered with the water a few inches deep, and that they soaked their hides on these rocks, and also submitted them to some process in the water which I did not stop to understand" ("Tent-life in the Holy Land").
 </p><p>Of them that waited on him continually (προσκαρτερούν των αὐτῷ)

 <p>Very hungry (πρόσπεινος)
 </p><p>Only here in New Testament.
 </p><p>Would have eaten (ἤθελε γεύσασθαι)
 </p><p>Rev., correctly, desired to eat. Γευέσθαι is rendered both to eat and to taste, more frequently the latter. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034">Mat 27:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009">Joh 2:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003">Pe1 2:3</a>; and compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011">Act 20:11</a>.
 </p><p>He fell into a trance (ἐπέπεσεν  ἐπ' αὐτὸν ἔκστασις)
 </p><p>Lit., an ecstasy fell upon him. The best texts, however, read ἐγένετο, came upon him, or happened to him. See on astonishment, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042">Mar 5:42</a>. Luke alone employs the word in this sense of ecstasy or trance.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">act 10:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Saw (θεωρεῖ)
 </p><p>Rev., better, and more literally, beholdeth. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018">Luk 10:18</a>. The present tense is graphically introduced into the narrative.
 </p><p>Unto him
 </p><p>The best texts omit.
 </p><p>Sheet (ὀθόνην)
 </p><p>Only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005">Act 11:5</a>. Originally fine linen; later, sail-cloth or a sail. Dr. J. Rawson Lumby suggests that the word, "applied to loose, bellying sails of ships," may indicate that the form of vessel which appeared to Peter "recalled an image most familiar to his previous life - the wind-stretched canvas of the craft on the Lake of Galilee" ("Expositor," iii., 272).
 </p><p>Knit (δεδεμένον)
 </p><p>If this is retained, we must render bound, or attached; but the best texts omit, together with the following and. Render, as Rev., let down by four corners. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005">Act 11:5</a>.
 </p><p>Corners (ἀρχαῖς)
 </p><p>Lit., beginnings; the extremity or corner, marking a beginning of the sheet. "We are to imagine the vessel, looking like a colossal four-cornered linen cloth letting itself down, while the corners attached to heaven to support the whole." The word is used in this sense by Herodotus, describing the sacrifices of the Scythians. The victim's forefeet are bound with a cord, "and the person who is about to offer, taking his station behind the victim, pulls the end (ἀρχὴν)of the rope, and thereby throws the animal down" (iv., 60). The suggestion of ropes holding the corners of the sheet (Alford, and, cautiously, Farrar) is unwarranted by the usage of the word. It was the technical expression in medical language for the ends of bandages. The word for sheet in this passage was also the technical term for a bandage, as was the kindred word ὀθόνιον, used of the linen bandages in which the Lord's body was swathed. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#012">Luk 24:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040">Joh 19:40</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005">Joh 20:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006">Joh 20:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007">Joh 20:7</a>. Mr. Hobart says: "We have thus in this passage a technical medical phrase - the ends of a bandage - used for the ends of a sheet, which hardly any one except a medical man would think of employing" ("Medical Language of St. Luke").

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">act 10:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>All manner of four-footed beasts (πάντα τὰ τετράποδα)
 </p><p>Lit., all the four-footed beasts. Without exception, clean and unclean. Not, of very many kinds.
 </p><p>Wild beasts
 </p><p>The best texts omit.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">act 10:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Not so (μηδαμῶς)
 </p><p>Stronger: by no means. "With that simple and audacious self-confidence which in his (Peter's) character was so singularly mingled with fits of timidity and depression, he boldly corrects the voice which orders him, and reminds the divine Interlocutor that he must, so to speak, have made an oversight" (Farrar, "Life and Works of Paul"). Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022">Mat 16:22</a>.
 </p><p>Common (κοινὸν)
 </p><p>Unholy.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">act 10:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Call not thou common (σὺ μὴ κοίνου)
 </p><p>The thought goes deeper than merely styling "common." Lit., do not thou defile. Do not profane it by regarding and calling it common. Rev., "make not thou common."

 <p>Near (ἀναγκαίους)
 </p><p>The word originally means necessary; hence of those who are bound by necessary or natural ties; blood-relations. But as relatives or kinsmen is expressed by συγγενεῖς, this must be taken in the sense of intimate friends, a meaning which it has in later Greek writers. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025">Acts 10:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">act 10:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Worshipped (προσεκύνησεν)
 </p><p>An unfortunate translation, according to modern English usage, but justified by the usage of earlier English, according to which to worship meant simply to honor. Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dignity or worth. This usage survives in the expressions worshipful and your worship. In the marriage-service of the English Church occurs the phrase, "With my body I thee worship." So Wycliffe renders <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019">Mat 19:19</a>, "Worship thy father and thy mother;" and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026">Joh 12:26</a>, "If any man serve me, my Father shall worship him." Here the meaning is that Cornelius paid reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental manner. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028">Acts 10:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">act 10:28</a></font></span></p>
 <p>An unlawful thing (ἀθέμιτον)
 </p><p>The word is peculiar to Peter, being used only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003">Pe1 4:3</a>. See note there. It emphasizes the violation of established order, being from the same root as τίθημι, to lay down or establish. The Jews professed to ground this prohibition on the law of Moses; but there is no direct command in the Mosaic law forbidding Jews to associate with those of other nations. But Peter's statement is general, referring to the general practice of the Jews to separate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons. Juvenal says that the Jews were taught by Moses "not to show the way except to one who practises the same rites, and to guide the circumcised alone to the well which they seek" (Sat., xiv., 104, 105). Tacitus also says of the Jews that "among themselves they are inflexibly faithful, and ready with charitable aid, but hate all others as enemies. They keep separate from all strangers in eating, sleeping, and matrimonial connections" ("Histories," v., 5).
 </p><p>Of another nation (ἀλλοφύλῳ)

In later ecclesiastical usage it signified ordain, as bishops or deacons.
