 <p>Collection (λογίας)
 </p><p>Peculiar to the New Testament, and occurring only here and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002">Co1 16:2</a>. The classical word is συλλόγη, Vulg., collecta, which latter is also used of the assemblies in which the collections took place. From λέγω to collect. For such material ministries Paul uses a variety of words; as χάρις bounty, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003">Co1 16:3</a>; κοινωνία contribution, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026">Rom 15:26</a>; εὐλογία. blessing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005">Co2 9:5</a>; λειτουπγία ministration, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012">Co2 9:12</a>; ἐλεημοσύναι alms, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017">Act 24:17</a>. The word ἔρανος was used by the Greeks to denote a feast of contribution or picnic; a club for mutual relief, and a contribution, made as a club-subscription, or for the support of the poor.
 </p><p>The saints
 </p><p>At Jerusalem. Evidently the community of property (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044">Act 2:44</a>) had been abandoned; and Augustine supposes that the poverty of the Jerusalem Christians was due to that practice. See note on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026">Rom 15:26</a>. The precise causes of the destitution in that church can be only conjectured.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co1 16:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Upon the first day of the week (κατὰ μίαν σαββάτου)
 </p><p>Κατὰ has a distributive force, every first day. For week, lit., Sabbath, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007">Act 20:7</a>.
 </p><p>Lay by him in store (παῤ ἑαυτῷ τιθέτω θησαυρίζων)
 </p><p>Lit., put by himself treasuring. Put by at home.
 </p><p>As God hath prospered (ὅ τι ἂν εὐοδῶται)
 </p><p>Lit., whatsoever he may prosper in. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010">Rom 1:10</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002">Jo3 1:2</a>; and see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029">Act 11:29</a> for the verb εὐπορέω in the similar sense of making a prosperous journey.
 </p><p>No gatherings, etc.
 </p><p>Rev., collections. The amount would be greater through systematic weekly saving than through collections made once for all on his arrival.
 </p><p>When I am come (ὅταν ἔλθω τότε)
 </p><p>Lit., then whenever I may have come. The indefinite whenever and the emphatic then indicate his unwillingness to rely upon a special contribution called forth by his arrival at any uncertain time. Christian beneficence is to be the outcome of a settled principle, not of an occasional impulse.

 <p>Approve by your letters
 </p><p>So A.V. and Rev. Others, however, connect by letters with will I send, making the letters to be Paul's introduction to the church at Jerusalem. The latter is preferable. The givers are to choose the bearers of the collection; Paul, as the originator and apostolic steward of the collection, will send the money. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004">1 Corinthians 16:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co1 16:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Meet for me to go (ἄξιον τοῦ κἀμὲ πορεύεσθαι)
 </p><p>Lit., if it be worthy of my going, i.e., if the gift be sufficiently large to warrant an apostolic journey to Jerusalem. This is better than if it be becoming. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">1 Corinthians 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co1 16:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Great and effectual door
 </p><p>Door metaphorically for opportunity: great as to its extent; effectual as to the result. The figure of an effectual door, as it stands, is of course clumsy, but the idea as a whole is clear: a great opportunity for effective work. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015">1 Corinthians 16:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co1 16:15</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Achaia
 </p><p>In a restricted sense, the northwest of Peloponnesus; but often used by the poets for the whole of Greece. Under the Romans Greece was divided into two provinces, Macedonia and Achaia; the former including Macedonia proper, with Illyricum, Epirus, and Thessaly, and the latter all that lay south of these. In this latter acceptation the word is uniformly employed in the New Testament. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017">1 Corinthians 16:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co1 16:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That which was lacking on your part (τὸ ὑμέτερο ὑστέρημα)
 </p><p>Or the (i.e. my) lack of you. The Greek will bear either rendering. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030">Phi 2:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014">Co2 8:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012">Co2 9:12</a>. The latter is preferable. Edwards, somewhat naively says: "I do not see what could be lacking on the part of the Corinthians which Stephanas and his two friends could supply at Ephesus."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">co1 16:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Asia
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009">Act 2:9</a>.
 </p><p>Aquila and Prisca
 </p><p>See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003">Rom 16:3</a>.

 <p>Maran-atha
 </p><p>Not to be joined with anathema as one phrase. Rev., properly, a period after anathema. Maranatha means the Lord cometh. It was a reminder of the second coming. The reason for the use of the Aramaic phrase is unknown. It is found in "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," ch. x., at the conclusion of the post-communion prayer. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020">Rev 22:20</a>.
