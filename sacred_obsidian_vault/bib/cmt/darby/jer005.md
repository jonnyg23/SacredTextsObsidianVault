 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001">Jeremiah Chapter 5</a></h3> 
 <p>The following commentary covers Chapters 4, 5, and 6.
 </p><p>Chapter 4 resumes the subject of chapters 2, 3, and, applying it at that time to the people, tells them that, if they return, it must be unto the Lord Himself-that neither forms nor half-measures would be of any use. After Verse 4 (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004">Jer 4:4</a>) the prophet announces the certain judgment of God, which should come from the north, and fall upon Jerusalem in destruction.
 </p><p>In chapter 5 the sin and iniquity are shewn to be universal: rich and poor, all are alike. And "Shall not I visit for these things? saith Jehovah." Nevertheless He will not destroy entirely. The source of evil, or, at least, that which maintains it, is pointed out. The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means. Chapter 6 continues the testimony, but gives also the position of Jeremiah in the midst of all this evil. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011">Jer 6:11-26</a> the judgment is plainly announced. The conduct of the false prophets is again marked. In both these chapters the coming of Nebuchadnezzar in judgment is evidently declared.
