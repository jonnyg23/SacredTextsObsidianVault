 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 92</a></h3> 
 <p>Psalm 92 takes up these names of God, Jehovah and Most High; only it is no longer a secret place, known only to fidelity and faith. Almighty power secured blessing and answers faith; Verses 7-8 explain how (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007">Psa 92:7-8</a>). What is celebrated is not the disciplinary exercise of faith, but the answer to it, showing that Jehovah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015">Psa 92:15</a>) is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness in Him. Psalms 90, 91, 92 go together as an introduction to the great theme that follows, Jehovah reigns. Already power had been displayed; and the full result in the judgment of all enemies and abiding blessing is looked for now, not merely as hope, but as founded on the manifested intervention of God. It is spoken in the place which Messiah had taken in the previous psalm, identified there in spirit with Israel in the latter days, Israel restored by divine power, but not yet in the full peaceful enjoyment of divine blessing, just as we have seen in Book 3. Messiah takes therefore the lead in praises, and looks to His horn being exalted with honor (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010">Psa 75:10</a>). But Jehovah's thoughts are deeper. He sees far, even the end from the beginning, and accomplishes all His purposes and His word. This is what faith has to remember.
