 <p>Alas! Saul is unchanged; instigated by the Ziphites, he seeks David anew, but it is only to fall again, and more publicly, into David's hands. Observe that David now appeals more directly to the Lord to judge between him and Saul. The separation is more complete. Saul was incorrigible. This appeal to God was becoming. It is not becoming, it is not according to the way of the Spirit, to accustom ourselves to evil. Righteous Father," said the Lord at length, "the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee; and these have known that thou hast sent me." That which characterised David in everything is, that he puts himself entirely into Jehovah's hands; it is the spirit of Christ in the Psalms.
