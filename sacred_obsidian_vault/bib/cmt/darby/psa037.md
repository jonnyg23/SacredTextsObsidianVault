 <p>Psalm 37. In this interesting psalm the great point pressed on the remnant, a lesson for every soul, is waiting on Jehovah, and not having the spirit disturbed by evil; they will soon be cut down like grass. They are not to fret themselves, but trust in Jehovah and do good; to delight in Him; they will have their desires; to commit their way to Him  He will justify them; to rest in Him and wait patiently for Him  Jehovah will soon interfere, the wicked doers be cut off, and the meek inherit the land. The other character of the remnant is also largely unfolded  the righteous man  from Verse 12 onward (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012">Psa 37:12-40</a>). Jehovah does not forsake His saints: they are preserved. The righteous shall inherit the land. The final word is, Wait on Jehovah and keep His way. The righteous suffer, but are not forsaken; the ungodly are in great prosperity, and soon their place knows them no more. How this, as to the righteous, points to the deep character of the suffering One who was forsaken, though the perfection of righteousness! This psalm also helps to show the connection between the disciples and this remnant (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005">Mat 5:5</a>) yet, to show the difference; the Son was there. They could suffer for His name: this brought in heaven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012">Mat 5:12</a>). He could reveal the Father, which He does, in that discourse. The light goes out to the world, as well as being the salt of the earth. Details of grace also are brought in, of which the latter-day remnant know nothing, because of this revelation of the Father, who acts in grace. Still, de facto, it is the same remnant.
