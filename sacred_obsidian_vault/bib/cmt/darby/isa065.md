 <p>The following commentary covers Chapters 64 and 65.
 </p><p>The next two chapters give us a full revelation of the dealings of God in answer to this appeal. First of all, God, through His grace, had been sought after by others. He had made Himself known to those who were not called by His name. The infinite and sovereign grace of God had sought out the poor Gentiles. At the same time, with infinite patience, He had stretched forth His hands to a people who would not have Him -to a people who provoked Him continually in the grossest manner. And now He declares His mind. The people that forsook Him shall be judged; He will number them with the sword; they shall bow down to the slaughter. But there shall be an elect remnant in grace-the servants of Jehovah, who shall be spared and blessed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011">Isa 64:11-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008">Isa 65:8-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013">Isa 65:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015">Isa 65:15</a>). Jehovah would then introduce an entirely new order of things, in which the truth of His promises should be acknowledged, and the former things should be quite forgotten-new heavens and a new earth, not as yet with respect to the physical change, but the moral order of which should be entirely new. It should not be only a new order of things on the earth, which the power of evil in the heavens might spoil, as in former days; the state of the heavens themselves should be new. We learn elsewhere that Satan will have been cast out, and his power there gone for ever. [See Note #1] Indeed, this would have been the occasion of the last terrible trials in Jerusalem. But now Jerusalem should be blessed in the earth, and her people should enjoy the gifts of Jehovah in as long a life as that of men before the flood. A man of a hundred years old should be a child; and if any one should die at that age, he must be looked upon as cut off by the curse of God. God would always grant the prayers of His people. Peace should be established, and there should be no evil in all His holy mountain. This is the millennial state of the Jews.
 </p><p>Note #1
 </p><p>Hence, when the Lord enters into Jerusalem as Jehovah Messiah, it is said (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038">Luk 19:38</a>) "peace in heaven."
