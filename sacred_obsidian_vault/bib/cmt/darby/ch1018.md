 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i>, by John Nelson Darby, [1857-62], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001">1 Chronicles Chapter 18</a></h3> 
 <p>The following commentary covers Chapters 18, 19, and 20.
 </p><p>In chapters 18, 19 and 20 David, already delivered from all internal conflict in Israel, triumphs over the heathen, and spreads the glory of Israel and of his reign on every side. These are the events which occasioned Psalm 18, although it has a more extended meaning (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#036">Ch1 18:36-45</a>). It will also be remarked that all David's faults are passed over in silence. Faithfully recounted elsewhere, they have no place here, because it is the fulfilment of the ways and thoughts of God in the house of the elect king that is here depicted. The children of the giant fall with the Philistines before the children of Israel.
