 <p>Chapter 54 gives the result of these events to Jerusalem in those days. Jerusalem is looked at as barren and desolate, after having rejected Him who came to be her husband; but now, through that grace which has made Jehovah to be her righteousness, she is called to enlarge the place of her tent, and spread forth the curtains of her habitation. That grace indeed reckons all gathered during her desolation as her children. Christ being owned as the son born to her, all came in under Him (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005">Psa 87:5-6</a>). For a little while God has treated her as a rejected wife, but has now comforted her with everlasting mercies.
