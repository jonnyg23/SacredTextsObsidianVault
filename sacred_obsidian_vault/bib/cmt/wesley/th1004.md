 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001">1 Thessalonians Chapter 4</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">th1 4:1</a></font></span></p>More and more - It is not enough to have faith, even so as to please God, unless we abound more and more therein. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">th1 4:3</a></font></span></p>Sanctification - Entire holiness of heart and life: particular branches of it are subjoined. That ye abstain from fornication - A beautiful transition from sanctification to a single branch of the contrary; and this shows that nothing is so seemingly distant, or below our thoughts, but we have need to guard against it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">th1 4:4</a></font></span></p>That every one know - For this requires knowledge, as well as chastity. To possess his vessel - His wife. In sanctification and honour - So as neither to dishonour God or himself, nor to obstruct, but further, holiness; remembering, marriage is not designed to inflame, but to conquer, natural desires. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">th1 4:5</a></font></span></p>Not in passionate desire - Which had no place in man when in a state of innocence. Who know not God - And so may naturally seek happiness in a creature. What seemingly accidental words slide in; and yet how fine, and how vastly important! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">th1 4:6</a></font></span></p>In this matter - By violating his bed. The things forbidden, here are three: fornication, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003">Th1 4:3</a>; the passion of desire, or inordinate affection in the married state, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005">Th1 4:5</a>; and the breach of the marriage contract. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">th1 4:8</a></font></span></p>He that despiseth - The commandments we gave. Despiseth God - Himself. Who hath also given you his Holy Spirit - To convince you of the truth, and enable you to be holy. What naked majesty of words! How oratorical, and yet with what great simplicity! - a simplicity that does not impair, but improve, the understanding to the utmost; that, like the rays of heat through a glass, collects all the powers of reason into one orderly point, from being scattered abroad in utter confusion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">th1 4:9</a></font></span></p>We need not write - Largely. For ye are taught of God - By his Spirit. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">th1 4:11</a></font></span></p>That ye study - Literally, that ye be ambitious: an ambition worthy a Christian. To work with your hands - Not a needless caution; for temporal concerns are often a cross to them who are newly filled with the love of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">th1 4:12</a></font></span></p>Decently - That they may have no pretence to say, (but they will say it still,) "This religion makes men idle, and brings them to beggary." And may want nothing - Needful for life and godliness. What Christian desires more? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">th1 4:13</a></font></span></p>Now - Herein the efficacy of Christianity greatly appears, - that it neither takes away nor embitters, but sweetly tempers, that most refined of all affections, our desire of or love to the dead. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">th1 4:14</a></font></span></p>So - As God raised him. With him - With their living head. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">th1 4:15</a></font></span></p>By the word of the Lord - By a particular revelation. We who are left - This intimates the fewness of those who will be then alive, compared to the multitude of the dead. Believers of all ages and nations make up, as it were, one body; in consideration of which, the believers of that age might put themselves in the place, and speak in the person, of them who were to live till the coming of the Lord. Not that St. Paul hereby asserted (though some seem to have imagined so) that the day of the Lord was at hand. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">th1 4:16</a></font></span></p>With a shout - Properly, a proclamation made to a great multitude. Above this is, the voice of the archangel; above both, the trumpet of God; the voice of God, somewhat analogous to the sound of a trumpet. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">th1 4:17</a></font></span></p>Together - In the same moment. In the air - The wicked will remain beneath, while the righteous, being absolved, shall be assessors with their Lord in the judgment. With the Lord - In heaven.
