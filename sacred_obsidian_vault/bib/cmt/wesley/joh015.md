 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001">John Chapter 15</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001">John 15:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">joh 15:1</a></font></span></p>I am the true vine - So the true bread, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032">Joh 6:32</a>; that is, the most excellent. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002">John 15:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">joh 15:2</a></font></span></p>Every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth - by obeying the truth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022">Pe1 1:22</a>; and by inward or outward sufferings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010">Heb 12:10-11</a>. So purity and fruitfulness help each other. That it may bear more fruit - For this is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of obedience, to make us yet more holy, and fit for farther and more eminent service. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003">John 15:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">joh 15:3</a></font></span></p>Ye are clean - All of you, to whom I now speak, are purged from the guilt and power of sin; by the word - Which, applied by the Spirit, is the grand instrument of purifying the soul. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004">John 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">joh 15:4</a></font></span></p>Abide in me - Ye who are now pure by living faith, producing all holiness; by which alone ye can be in me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005">John 15:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">joh 15:5</a></font></span></p>I am the vine, ye are the branches - Our Lord in this whole passage speaks of no branches but such as are, or at least were once, united to him by living faith. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006">John 15:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">joh 15:6</a></font></span></p>If any one abide not in me - By living faith; not by Church communion only. He may thus abide in Christ, and be withered all the time, and cast into the fire at last. He is cast out - Of the vineyard, the invisible Church. Therefore he was in it once. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007">John 15:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joh 15:7</a></font></span></p>If ye abide in me, ye shall ask - Prayers themselves are a fruit of faith, and they produce more fruit. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008">John 15:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">joh 15:8</a></font></span></p>So shall ye be my disciples - Worthy of the name. To be a disciple of Christ is both the foundation and height of Christianity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009">John 15:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">joh 15:9</a></font></span></p>Abide ye in my love - Keep your place in my affection. See that ye do not forfeit that invaluable blessing. How needless a caution, if it were impossible for them not to abide therein? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#010">John 15:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">joh 15:10</a></font></span></p>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love - On these terms, and no other, ye shall remain the objects of my special affection. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011">John 15:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joh 15:11</a></font></span></p>That my joy might remain in you - The same joy which I feel in loving the Father, and keeping his commandments. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012">John 15:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">joh 15:12</a></font></span></p>Your joy will be full, if ye so love one another. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013">John 15:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">joh 15:13</a></font></span></p>Greater love - To his friends. He here speaks of them only. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014">John 15:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">joh 15:14</a></font></span></p>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you - On this condition, not otherwise. A thunderbolt for Antinomianism! Who then dares assert that God's love does not at all depend on man's works? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015">John 15:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">joh 15:15</a></font></span></p>All things - Which might be of service to you. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016">John 15:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">joh 15:16</a></font></span></p>Ye - My apostles, have not chosen me, but I have chosen you - As clearly appears from the sacred history: and appointed you, that ye may go and bear fruit - I have chosen and appointed you for this end, that ye may go and convert sinners: and that your fruit may remain - That the fruit of your labours may remain to the end of the world; yea, to eternity; that whatsoever ye shall ask - The consequence of your going and bearing fruit will be, that all your prayers will he heard. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019">John 15:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">joh 15:19</a></font></span></p>Because ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you - Because your maxims, tempers, actions, are quite opposite to theirs. For the very same reason must the world in all ages hate those who are not of the world. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020">John 15:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">joh 15:20</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016">Joh 13:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024">Mat 10:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040">Luk 6:40</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021">John 15:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">joh 15:21</a></font></span></p>All these things will they do to you, because they know not him that sent me - And in all ages and nations they who know not God will, for this cause, hate and persecute those that do. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022">John 15:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">joh 15:22</a></font></span></p>They had not had sin - Not in this respect. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#023">John 15:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">joh 15:23</a></font></span></p>He that hateth me - As every unbeliever doth, For as the love of God is inseparable from faith, so is the hatred of God from unbelief. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025">John 15:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">joh 15:25</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004">Psa 69:4</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026">John 15:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">joh 15:26</a></font></span></p>When the Comforter is come, whom I will send from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me - The Spirit's coming, and being sent by our Lord from the Father, to testify of him, are personal characters, and plainly distinguish him from the Father and the Son; and his title as the Spirit of truth, together with his proceeding from the Father, can agree to none but a Divine person. And that he proceeds from the Son, as well as from the Father, may be fairly argued from his being called the Spirit of Christ, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011">Pe1 1:11</a>; and from his being here said to be sent by Christ from the Father, as well as sent by the Father in his name.
