 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 10:3</a></font></span></p>Boasteth - He glorieth in his very sins which are his shame, and especially in the satisfaction of his desires. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004">Psalms 10:4</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 10:10</a></font></span></p>Croucheth - Like a lion (for he continues the same metaphor) which lies close upon the ground, partly that he may not be discovered, and partly that he may more suddenly and surely lay hold on his prey.

Therefore his peoples case is never desperate, seeing he ever lives to help them. The heathen - The Canaanites; whom God, as king of the world, expelled, and gave their land to his people. By which great example he confirms his faith and hope for the future. His land - Out of Canaan, which God calls his land, because he gave it to them, and fixed his presence and dwelling in it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017">Psalms 10:17</a></p>
