And he knew Hoshea contented himself with the worship of the calves, and did not practise that great idolatry which his predecessors had used, and therefore would patiently suffer the breaking of the images of Baal, and the things belonging to them.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004">2 Chronicles 31:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch2 31:4</a></font></span></p>Encouraged - Freed them from worldly cares and distractions, and enabled to give up themselves entirely to the serious study of God's law, and to the instruction, and direction, and quickening of the people.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch2 31:5</a></font></span></p>Came abroad - As Soon as the king extended that command to all the parts of his kingdom, which, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004">Ch2 31:4</a>, was confined to them that dwelt in Jerusalem. Honey - Or, dates, as the Hebrew writers generally, understand this word, which were given to them, because of the sweetness of their taste in some sort resembling honey.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ch2 31:8</a></font></span></p>Blessed the Lord - Both for giving such plentiful provisions to his land and for giving his people such liberal hearts. And they praised the people for their forwardness and faithfulness in it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#009">2 Chronicles 31:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch2 31:9</a></font></span></p>Questioned - How it came to pass that no more of their provision was spent and that there yet remained such great heaps of it.
