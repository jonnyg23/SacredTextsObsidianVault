 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 44:1</a></font></span></p>At Migdol - It seems the Jews that went into Egypt had planted themselves at these four places. Migdol was a city upon the borders of the Red Sea. Noph was a city, which the Greeks and Latines called Memphis; it is thought to be that, which is now called Cairo. Pathros was the province, since called Thebais.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 44:14</a></font></span></p>For none - Only such shall escape, as have been forced into Egypt against their wills; and as did not fall in with the idolatry of the Egyptians.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jer 44:15</a></font></span></p>All the men - It should seem those that did it were mostly women, and that they did it with some privacy, so that all their husbands did not know of it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">jer 44:26</a></font></span></p>The Lord liveth - There shall not any be left alive of the Jews that are in Egypt, to swear The Lord God liveth.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">jer 44:29</a></font></span></p>This shall be a sign - Signs are usually antecedent to the thing signified, but the word is taken in a larger notion in this place for that which should attend the thing signified by it.
