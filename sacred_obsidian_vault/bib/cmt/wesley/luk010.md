 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002">Luke 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">luk 10:2</a></font></span></p>Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that he would thrust forth labourers - For God alone can do this: he alone can qualify and commission men for this work. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037">Mat 9:37</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003">Luke 10:3</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004">Luke 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">luk 10:4</a></font></span></p>Salute no man by the way - The salutations usual among the Jews took up much time. But these had so much work to do in so short a space, that they had not a moment to spare. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006">Luke 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">luk 10:6</a></font></span></p>A son of peace - That is, one worthy of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007">Luke 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">luk 10:7</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011">Mat 10:11</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011">Luke 10:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">luk 10:11</a></font></span></p>The kingdom of God is at hand - Though ye will not receive it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013">Luke 10:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">luk 10:13</a></font></span></p>Wo to thee, Chorazin - The same declaration Christ had made some time before. By repeating it now, he warns the seventy not to lose time by going to those cities. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021">Mat 11:21</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016">Luke 10:16</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018">Luke 10:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">luk 10:18</a></font></span></p>I beheld Satan - That is, when ye went forth, I saw the kingdom of Satan, which was highly exalted, swiftly and suddenly cast down. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019">Luke 10:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">luk 10:19</a></font></span></p>I give you power - That is, I continue it to you: and nothing shall hurt you - Neither the power, nor the subtilty of Satan. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020">Luke 10:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">luk 10:20</a></font></span></p>Rejoice not so much that the devils are subject to you, as that your names are written in heaven - Reader, so is thine, if thou art a true, believer. God grant it may never be blotted out! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021">Luke 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">luk 10:21</a></font></span></p>Lord of heaven and earth - In both of which thy kingdom stands, and that of Satan is destroyed. That thou hast hid these things - He rejoiced not in the destruction of the wise and prudent, but in the display of the riches of God's grace to others, in such a manner as reserves to Him the entire glory of our salvation, and hides pride from man. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025">Mat 11:25</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022">Luke 10:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">luk 10:22</a></font></span></p>Who the Son is - Essentially one with the Father: who the Father is - How great, how wise, how good! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#023">Luke 10:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">luk 10:23</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#016">Mat 13:16</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025">Luke 10:25</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027">Luke 10:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">luk 10:27</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God - That is, thou shalt unite all the faculties of thy soul to render him the most intelligent and sincere, the most affectionate and resolute service. We may safely rest in this general sense of these important words, if we are not able to fix the particular meaning of every single word. If we desire to do this, perhaps the heart, which is a general expression, may be explained by the three following, With all thy soul, with the warmest affection, with all thy strength, the most vigorous efforts of thy will, and with all thy mind or understanding, in the most wise and reasonable manner thou canst; thy understanding guiding thy will and affections. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005">Deu 6:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018">Lev 19:18</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028">Luke 10:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">luk 10:28</a></font></span></p>Thou hast answered right; this do, and thou shalt live - Here is no irony, but a deep and weighty truth. He, and he alone, shall live for ever, who thus loves God and his neighbour in the present life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029">Luke 10:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">luk 10:29</a></font></span></p>To justify himself - That is, to show he had done this. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Lev 18:5</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030">Luke 10:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">luk 10:30</a></font></span></p>From Jerusalem to Jericho - The road from Jerusalem to Jericho (about eighteen miles from it) lay through desert and rocky places: so many robberies and murders were committed therein, that it was called the bloody way. Jericho was situated in the valley: hence the phrase of going down to it. About twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#031">Luke 10:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">luk 10:31</a></font></span></p>The common translation is, by chance - Which is full of gross improprieties. For if we speak strictly, there is no such thing in the universe as either chance or fortune. A certain priest came down that way, and passed by on the other side - And both he and the Levite no doubt could find an excuse for passing over on the other side, and might perhaps gravely thank God for their own deliverance, while they left their brother bleeding to death. Is it not an emblem of many living characters, perhaps of some who bear the sacred office? O house of Levi and of Aaron, is not the day coming, when the virtues of heathens and Samaritans will rise up in judgment against you? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033">Luke 10:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">luk 10:33</a></font></span></p>But a certain Samaritan came where he was - It was admirably well judged to represent the distress on the side of the Jew, and the mercy on that of the Samaritan. For the case being thus proposed, self interest would make the very scribe sensible, how amiable such a conduct was, and would lay him open to our Lord's inference. Had it been put the other way, prejudice might more easily have interposed, before the heart could have been affected. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034">Luke 10:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">luk 10:34</a></font></span></p>Pouring in oil and wine - Which when well beaten together are one of the best balsams that can be applied to a fresh wound. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036">Luke 10:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">luk 10:36</a></font></span></p>Which of these was the neighbour to him that fell among the robbers - Which acted the part of a neighbour? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#037">Luke 10:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">luk 10:37</a></font></span></p>And he said, He that showed mercy on him - He could not for shame say otherwise, though he thereby condemned himself and overthrew his own false notion of the neighbour to whom our love is due. Go and do thou in like manner - Let us go and do likewise, regarding every man as our neighbour who needs our assistance. Let us renounce that bigotry and party zeal which would contract our hearts into an insensibility for all the human race, but a small number whose sentiments and practices are so much our own, that our love to them is but self love reflected. With an honest openness of mind let us always remember that kindred between man and man, and cultivate that happy instinct whereby, in the original constitution of our nature, God has strongly bound us to each other. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040">Luke 10:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">luk 10:40</a></font></span></p>Martha was encumbered - The Greek word properly signifies to be drawn different ways at the same time, and admirably expresses the situation of a mind, surrounded (as Martha's then was) with so many objects of care, that it hardly knows which to attend to first. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041">Luke 10:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">luk 10:41</a></font></span></p>Martha, Martha - There is a peculiar spirit and tenderness in the repetition of the word: thou art careful, inwardly, and hurried, outwardly. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042">Luke 10:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">luk 10:42</a></font></span></p>Mary hath chosen the good part - To save her soul. Reader, hast thou?
