 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 61:4</a></font></span></p>I will - I shall, I doubt not, be restored to the tabernacle, and worship thee there all my days.

Truth - Thy truth in giving me those mercies which thou hast promised, and thy mercy in giving me such further blessings as I needs.
