 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 39:5</a></font></span></p>Sent - Who hath given him this disposition that he loves freedom, and hates that subjection which other creatures quietly endure? Loosed - Who keeps him from receiving the bands, and submitting to the service of man. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#007">Job 39:7</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 39:17</a></font></span></p>Deprived - Because God hath not implanted in her that instinct, and affection, which he hath put into other birds and beasts toward their young.

Scorneth - She despises them thro' her swiftness; for though she cannot fly, yet by the aid of her wings she runs so fast, that horse - men cannot reach her. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019">Job 39:19</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#024">Job 39:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 39:24</a></font></span></p>Swalloweth - He is so full of rage and fury, that he not only champs his bridle, but is ready to tear and devour the very ground on which he goes. Believeth - He is so pleased with the approach of the battle, and the sound of the trumpet calling to it, that he can scarce believe his ears for gladness.
