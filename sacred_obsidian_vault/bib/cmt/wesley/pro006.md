With - With the creditor, whom he calls a stranger, because the usurers in Israel, who lent money to others, upon condition of paying use for it, were either Heathens, or were reputed as bad as Heathens, because this practice was forbidden by God's law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019">Deu 23:19</a>.
