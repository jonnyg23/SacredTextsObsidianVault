 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001">Hosea 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 3:1</a></font></span></p>Of her friend - Her husband. An adulteress - Either already tainted, or that certainly will be tainted with that vice. According to the love - Let this be the emblem of my love to the children of Israel. And love - Love the feasts of their idols, where they drink wine to excess. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002">Hosea 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 3:2</a></font></span></p>Fifteen pieces of silver - It was half the value of a slave, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032">Exo 21:32</a>. An homer of barley - About fourteen bushels. Of barley - The meanest kind of provision; and suited to a low condition, all this is, to set forth Israel's indigence and ingratitude, and God's bounty to Israel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003">Hosea 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">hos 3:3</a></font></span></p>Abide for me - Thou shalt wait unmarried, until I espouse thee. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004">Hosea 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">hos 3:4</a></font></span></p>For - Now the parable is unfolded, it shall be with Israel as with such a woman, they and she were guilty of adultery, both punished long, both made slaves, kept hardly, and valued meanly, yet in mercy at last pardoned, and re - accepted tho' after a long time of probation. Without a king - None of their own royal line shall sit on the throne. A prince - Strangers shall be princes and governors over them. Without a sacrifice - Offered according to the law. An image - They could carry none of their images with them, and the Assyrians would not let them make new ones. Ephod - No priest as well as no ephod. And without teraphim - Idolatrous images kept in their private houses, like the Roman household gods; in one word, such should be the state of their captives; they should have nothing of their own either in religious or civil affairs, but be wholly under the power of their conquering enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hosea 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">hos 3:5</a></font></span></p>Return - Repent. And David - The Messiah who is the son of David. And his goodness - God and his goodness; that is, the good and gracious God. God in Christ and with Christ shall be worshipped. The latter days - In the days of the Messiah, in gospel - times.
