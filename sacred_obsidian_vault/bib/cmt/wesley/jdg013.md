 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001">Judges Chapter 13</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001">Judges 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jdg 13:1</a></font></span></p>Did evil - That is, fell into idolatry, not after the death of Abdon the last judge, but in the days of the former judges. Forty years - To be computed, not from Abdon's death, but before that time. And it is probable that great slaughter of the Ephraimites made by Jephthah, greatly encouraged the Philistines to rise against Israel, when one of their chief bulwarks was so much weakened; and therefore began to domineer over them not long after Jephthah's death. These were a very inconsiderable people. They had but five cities of any note. And yet when God used them as the staff in his hand, they were very oppressive and vexatious. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002">Judges 13:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jdg 13:2</a></font></span></p>Of the family - That is, of the tribe or people. Bare not - An emphatical repetition of the same thing in other words, which is an usual elegancy both in scripture and other authors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003">Judges 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jdg 13:3</a></font></span></p>The angel - The Son of God, yet distinguished from the Lord, because he appeared here in the form of a servant, as a messenger sent from God. The great Redeemer did in a particular manner concern himself about this typical redeemer. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#004">Judges 13:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jdg 13:4</a></font></span></p>Beware - Because the child was to be a Nazarite from the womb, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005">Jdg 13:5</a>, and from the conception; and because the mother's pollution extends to the child, she is enjoined from this time to observe the following rules belonging to the Nazarites. Strong drink - Under which are comprehended the other particulars mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002">Num 6:2-4</a>. Nor eat - Any of those meats forbidden, Lev. 11:1-47, which were forbidden to all, but especially to the Nazarites. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005">Judges 13:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jdg 13:5</a></font></span></p>A Nazarite - A person consecrated to God's service. Begin to deliver - And the deliverance shall be carried on and perfected by others, as it was by Eli, Samuel, and Saul; but especially by David. God chuses to carry on his work gradually and by several hands. One lays the foundation of a good work, another builds, and perhaps a third brings forth the top stone. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006">Judges 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jdg 13:6</a></font></span></p>Man of God - A prophet, or sacred person, sent with a message from God. Terrible - Or, venerable, awful, full of Majesty. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#012">Judges 13:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jdg 13:12</a></font></span></p>Let thy words - Or, thy words shall come to pass: I firmly believe thy promises shall be fulfilled. How - What rules shall we observe about his education? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#013">Judges 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jdg 13:13</a></font></span></p>Let her - Whilst the child is in her womb, and after the child is born let him observe the same orders. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015">Judges 13:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jdg 13:15</a></font></span></p>Made ready - Supposing him to be a man and a prophet, to whom he would in this manner express his respect, as was usual to strangers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016">Judges 13:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jdg 13:16</a></font></span></p>Bread - That is, meat, as bread is commonly taken in scripture. To the Lord - Not unto a man, as thou apprehendest me to be; but unto the Lord, as thou wilt by and by perceive me to be. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017">Judges 13:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jdg 13:17</a></font></span></p>Honour - Either by making honourable mention of thee, or by shewing respect to thee, by a present, which they usually gave to prophets. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018">Judges 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jdg 13:18</a></font></span></p>Secret - Hidden from mortal men: or, wonderful, such as thou canst not comprehend: my nature and essence, (which is often signified by name in scripture) is incomprehensible. This shews, that this was the angel of the covenant, the Son of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019">Judges 13:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jdg 13:19</a></font></span></p>Meal - offering - Which were generally joined with the chief sacrifices. A Rock - The angel's presence and command being a sufficient warrant for the offering of sacrifice by a person who was no priest, and in a place otherwise forbidden. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020">Judges 13:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jdg 13:20</a></font></span></p>The altar - That is, from that part of the rock which served instead of an altar, upon which the sacrifice was laid. Ascended - To manifest his nature and essence to be spiritual. Fell - Partly in reverence to that glorious presence manifested in so wonderful a manner: and partly, out of a religious horror and fear of death; for the prevention thereof they fell down in way of supplication to God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#023">Judges 13:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">jdg 13:23</a></font></span></p>Nor would, &amp;c. - This expression seems to have some emphasis in it, to enhance God's mercy to them, as being afforded them in a time of such grievous calamity; and in a time when the word of the lord was precious; and there was no open vision. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#024">Judges 13:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">jdg 13:24</a></font></span></p>Blessed him - That is, endowed him with all those graces and gifts of mind and body which were necessary for the work he was designed for. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025">Judges 13:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">jdg 13:25</a></font></span></p>To move - That is, to stir him up to heroical designs; to shew forth its power in the frame of his mind, and in the strength of his body, discovered to his neighbours in extraordinary actions; to encline his heart to great attempts for the help and deliverance of God's people, to give some essays of it to his brethren, and to seek all opportunities for it. Of Dan - A place so called, either from the expedition of the Danites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011">Jdg 18:11-12</a>, which though placed after this history, was done before it: or from some other camp which the Danites had formed there, to give some check to the incursions of the Philistines.
