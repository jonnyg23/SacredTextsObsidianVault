 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001">Job Chapter 7</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001">Job 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 7:1</a></font></span></p>Is there not - Job is here excusing what he cannot justify, his passionate longing for death. A time - Is there not a time limited by God, wherein man shall live in this sinful, and miserable world? And is it a crime in me, to desire that God would bring me to that joyful period? Our time on earth is limited and short, according to the narrow bounds of this earth. But heaven cannot be measured, nor the days of heaven numbered. Hireling - Whose time is short, being but a few years, or days, whose condition is full of toil and hardship. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002">Job 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 7:2</a></font></span></p>Shadow - That is, the sun - set, the time allotted for his rest. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003">Job 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 7:3</a></font></span></p>So - This so respects not so much the desire of an hired servant, as the ground of it, his hard toil and service. Possess - God, hath given me this as my lot and inheritance. Months - So he calls them rather than days, to note the tediousness of his affliction. Vanity - Empty and unsatisfying. Nights - He mentions nights, because that is the saddest time for sick and miserable persons; the darkness and solitude of the night being of themselves uncomfortable, and giving them more opportunity for solemn and sorrowful reflections. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005">Job 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 7:5</a></font></span></p>Worms - Which were bred out of Job's corrupted flesh and sores. Dust - The dust of the earth upon which he lay. Broken - By ulcers in all parts of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006">Job 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 7:6</a></font></span></p>Swifter - The time of my life hastens to a period. Shuttle - Which passes in a moment from one end of the web to the other. Hope - Of enjoying any good day here. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007">Job 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 7:7</a></font></span></p>O - He turns his speech to God. Perhaps observing, that his friends grew weary of hearing it. If men will not hear us, God will: if men cannot help us, he can: for his arm is not shortened, neither is his ear heavy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008">Job 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 7:8</a></font></span></p>No more - In this mortal state: I shall never return to this life again. Am not - If thou cast one angry look upon me, I am not; thou canst look me into eternity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#009">Job 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 7:9</a></font></span></p>No more - Never until the general resurrection. When we see a cloud which looked great, as if it would eclipse the sun, of a sudden dispersed and disappearing, say, Just such a thing is the life of man, a vapour that appears for a while and then vanisheth away. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010">Job 7:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 7:10</a></font></span></p>Any more - He shall no more be seen and known in his former habitation. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die: for this will own us no more. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011">Job 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 7:11</a></font></span></p>Therefore - Since my life is so vain and short, and when once lost, without all hopes of recovery. I will plead with God for pity before I die; I will not smother my anguish within my breast, but will ease myself by pouring out my complaints. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012">Job 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 7:12</a></font></span></p>A sea - Am I as fierce and unruly as the sea, which, if thou didst not set bounds to it, would overwhelm the earth? Or, am I a vast and ungovernable sea - monster? Which thou must restrain by thy powerful providence. That, &amp;c. - That thou shouldest guard and restrain me with such heavy and unexampled miseries? We are apt in affliction to complain of God, as if he laid more upon us than there is occasion for: whereas we are never in heaviness, but when there is need, nor more than there is need. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017">Job 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 7:17</a></font></span></p>What, &amp;c. - What is there in that poor, mean, creature called man, miserable man, as this word signifies, which can induce thee to take any notice of him, or to make such account of him? Man is not worthy of thy favour, and he is below thy anger; that thou shouldest concern thyself so much about him, as one near and dear to thee? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018">Job 7:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 7:18</a></font></span></p>And try, &amp;c. - What is man that vain, foolish creature, that thou shouldest magnify or regard, or visit him, (with thy mercy and blessings, that thou shouldest so far honour and regard him, as by thy visitation to preserve his spirit, or hold his soul in life) and try him, which God doth not only by afflictions, but also by prosperity and both inward and outward blessings? That thou shouldst observe his motions every moment, as in care for him, and jealous over him? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019">Job 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 7:19</a></font></span></p>How long - How long will it be ere thou withdraw thy afflicting hand? Swallow - That I may have a breathing time: a proverbial expression. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020">Job 7:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 7:20</a></font></span></p>Sinned - Although I am free from those crying sins, for which my friends suppose thou hast sent this judgment upon me, yet, I freely confess I am a sinner, and therefore obnoxious to thy justice. What, &amp;c. - To satisfy thy justice, or regain thy favour? Who dost know and diligently observe all mens inward motions, and outward actions; and therefore, if thou shalt be severe to mark mine iniquities, I have not what to say or do unto thee. My case is singular, none is shot at as I am. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021">Job 7:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 7:21</a></font></span></p>Pardon - Seeing thou art so gracious to others, why may not I hope for the same favour from thee? Dust - If thou dost not speedily help me, it will be too late. But I shall not be - It will be to late to shew me favour.
