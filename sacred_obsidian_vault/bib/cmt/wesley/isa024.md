 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013">Isaiah 24:13</a></p>

My leanness - I faint and pine away for grief, for the following reason. Treacherously - The Jews, who have been frequently guilty of great perfidiousness towards God, are now acting the same part.

He repeats it to shew the horridness of the crime.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">isa 24:22</a></font></span></p>Gathered - By God's special providence, in order to their punishment.

After - After the apostate Jews shall have been shut up in unbelief, and in great tribulations for many ages together, they shall be convinced of their sin in crucifying the Messiah, and brought home to God and Christ by true repentance.

The Lord - The Messiah, who, tho' man, yet is also God, and the Lord of hosts. Shall reign - Shall come in the flesh, and set up his kingdom, first in Jerusalem, and afterward in all other nations. Before - Before his ministers, who are in some sort the courtiers of the King of Glory. But the ancients are here put for the whole church, in whose name and for whose service they act.
