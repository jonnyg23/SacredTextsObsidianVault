 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001">Lamentations 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">lam 2:1</a></font></span></p>His footstool - His temple; but suffered the Chaldeans to destroy it. Cast down - That is, thrown them down from the highest glory and honour, to the meanest degree of servitude. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002">Lamentations 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lam 2:2</a></font></span></p>Polluted - Dealt with them as with a polluted thing; cast them off, brake them in pieces. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003">Lamentations 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lam 2:3</a></font></span></p>The horn - All their beauty and strength. Drawn back - God hath drawn back his assistance which he was wont to give the Jews against their enemies. Round about - God consumed them, not in this or that part, but round about, as a fire seizing an house at once on all sides.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">lam 2:4</a></font></span></p>He - That is, God, (whom by their sins they had provoked and made their enemy) behaved himself as an enemy. And slew - All their young men, and maidens who were pleasant to look upon.

The king - By the king and the priests are meant persons of greatest rank and eminency, though it is thought here is a special reference to Zedekiah the king of Judah, and Seraiah who was the high priest; the former of which was miserably handled, the latter slain. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007">Lamentations 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">lam 2:7</a></font></span></p>They - The enemies with their triumphs and blasphemies, made as great a noise, as those that sang holy songs, or played on instruments, were wont to make to the glory of God.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">lam 2:8</a></font></span></p>The wall - The strength and security of the Jews. A line - Artificers used with lines not only to mark out places for building, but also for destruction, to direct them what to cut off; and such a line is here meant.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">lam 2:9</a></font></span></p>Among the Gentiles - In miserable captivity. The law - Is no more read, opened or observed. Her prophets - They had but very few prophets, from this time to the time of the gospel, and very few of those at this time alive had any revelation from God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010">Lamentations 2:10</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">lam 2:11</a></font></span></p>Mine eyes - This whole verse is but expressive of the prophets great affliction for the miseries come upon the Jews. He wept himself almost blind. Bowels - His passion had disturbed his bodily humours, that his bowels were troubled. Liver - His gall lying under his liver. All these are expressions of great affliction and sorrow. Swoon - During the famine, occasioned by the long siege. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012">Lamentations 2:12</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">lam 2:13</a></font></span></p>Who - There was no people whose condition was in any degree parallel to the misery of the Jews: nor was there any cure for them, their breach was like a sea breach where the waters come in with such a torrent, that there is no making any defence against them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014">Lamentations 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lam 2:14</a></font></span></p>The prophets - False prophets told you vain stories.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">lam 2:20</a></font></span></p>Whom - Not the Heathen, but to thy own people. Women - Wilt thou suffer women to satisfy their hunger with the fruit of their own bodies? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022">Lamentations 2:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">lam 2:22</a></font></span></p>My terrors - As my people were wont to be called together from all parts in a solemn day, so now my terrible enemies, or terrible things are by thee called together.
