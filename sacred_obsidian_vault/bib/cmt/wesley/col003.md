 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">col 3:3</a></font></span></p>For ye are dead - To the things on earth. And your real, spiritual life is hid from the world, and laid up in God, with Christ - Who hath merited, promised, prepared it for us, and gives us the earnest and foretaste of it in our hearts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004">Colossians 3:4</a></p>

Your members - Which together make up the body of sin. Which are upon the earth - Where they find their nourishment. Uncleanness - In act, word, or thought. Inordinate affection - Every passion which does not flow from and lead to the love of God. Evil desire - The desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life. Covetousness - According to the derivation of the word, means the desire of having more, or of any thing independent on God. Which is idolatry - Properly and directly; for it is giving the heart to a creature.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021">Colossians 3:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">col 3:21</a></font></span></p>Lest they be discouraged - Which may occasion their turning either desperate or stupid.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">col 3:23</a></font></span></p>Heartily - Cheerfully, diligently.
