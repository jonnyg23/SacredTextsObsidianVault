 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001">2 Corinthians Chapter 4</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001">2 Corinthians 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co2 4:1</a></font></span></p>Therefore having this ministry - Spoken of, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006">Co2 3:6</a>. As we have received mercy - Have been mercifully supported in all our trials. We faint not - We desist not in any degree from our glorious enterprise. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002">2 Corinthians 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co2 4:2</a></font></span></p>But have renounced - Set at open defiance. The hidden things of shame - All things which men need to hide, or to be ashamed of. Not walking in craftiness - Using no disguise, subtlety, guile. Nor privily corrupting the pure word of God - By any additions or alterations, or by attempting to accommodate it to the taste of the hearers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003">2 Corinthians 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co2 4:3</a></font></span></p>But if our gospel also - As well as the law of Moses. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004">2 Corinthians 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co2 4:4</a></font></span></p>The God of this world - What a sublime and horrible description of Satan! He is indeed the god of all that believe not, and works in them with inconceivable energy. Hath blinded - Not only veiled, the eye of their understanding. Illumination - Is properly the reflection or propagation of light, from those who are already enlightened, to others. Who is the image of God - Hence also we may understand how great is the glory of Christ. He that sees the Son, sees the Father in the face of Christ. The Son exactly exhibits the Father to us. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005">2 Corinthians 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co2 4:5</a></font></span></p>For - The fault is not in us, neither in the doctrine they hear from us. We preach not ourselves - As able either to enlighten, or pardon, or sanctify you. But Jesus Christ - As your only wisdom, righteousness, sanctification. And ourselves your servants - Ready to do the meanest offices. For Jesus' sake - Not for honour, interest, or pleasure. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006">2 Corinthians 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co2 4:6</a></font></span></p>For God hath shined in our hearts - The hearts of all those whom the god of this world no longer blinds. God who is himself our light; not only the author of light, but also the fountain of it. To enlighten us with the knowledge of the glory of God - Of his glorious love, and of his glorious image. In the face of Jesus Christ - Which reflects his glory in another manner than the face of Moses did. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007">2 Corinthians 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co2 4:7</a></font></span></p>But we - Not only the apostles, but all true believers. Have this treasure - Of divine light, love, glory. In earthen vessels - In frail, feeble, perishing bodies. He proceeds to show, that afflictions, yea, death itself, are so far from hindering the ministration of the Spirit, that they even further it, sharpen the ministers, and increase the fruit. That the excellence of the power, which works these in us, may undeniably appear to be of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008">2 Corinthians 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co2 4:8</a></font></span></p>We are troubled, &amp;c. - The four articles in this verse respect inward, the four in the next outward, afflictions. In each clause the former part shows the "earthen vessels;" the latter, "the excellence of the power." Not crushed - Not swallowed up in care and anxiety. Perplexed - What course to take, but never despairing of his power and love to carry us through. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010">2 Corinthians 4:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co2 4:10</a></font></span></p>Always - Wherever we go. Bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus - Continually expecting to lay down our lives like him. That the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body - That we may also rise and be glorified like him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011">2 Corinthians 4:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co2 4:11</a></font></span></p>For we who yet live - Who are not yet killed for the testimony of Jesus. Are always delivered unto death - Are perpetually in the very jaws of destruction; which we willingly submit to, that we may "obtain a better resurrection." 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012">2 Corinthians 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co2 4:12</a></font></span></p>So then death worketh in us, but life in you - You live in peace; we die daily. Yet - Living or dying, so long as we believe, we cannot but speak. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013">2 Corinthians 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">co2 4:13</a></font></span></p>Having the same spirit of faith - Which animated the saints of old; David, in particular, when he said, I believed, and therefore have I spoken - That is, I trusted in God, and therefore he hath put this song of praise in my mouth. We also speak - We preach the gospel, even in the midst of affliction and death, because we believe that God will raise us up from the dead, and will present us, ministers, with you, all his members, "faultless before his presence with exceeding joy." <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010">Psa 116:10</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015">2 Corinthians 4:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co2 4:15</a></font></span></p>For all things - Whether adverse or prosperous. Are for your sakes - For the profit of all that believe, as well as all that preach. That the overflowing grace - Which continues you alive both in soul and body. Might abound yet more through the thanksgiving of many - For thanksgiving invites more: abundant grace. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016">2 Corinthians 4:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">co2 4:16</a></font></span></p>Therefore - Because of this grace, we faint not. The outward man - The body. The inward man - The soul. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017">2 Corinthians 4:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co2 4:17</a></font></span></p>Our light affliction - The beauty and sublimity of St. Paul's expressions here, as descriptive of heavenly glory, opposed to temporal afflictions, surpass all imagination, and cannot be preserved in any translation or paraphrase, which after all must sink infinitely below the astonishing original. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018">2 Corinthians 4:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">co2 4:18</a></font></span></p>The things that are seen - Men, money, things of earth. The things that are not seen - God, grace, heaven.
