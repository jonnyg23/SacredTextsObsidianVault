 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sol 5:1</a></font></span></p>I come - This is the bridegroom's answer. I have - I have eaten of my pleasant fruits, I have taken notice of, and delight in the service and obedience of my people. O friends - Believers are here encouraged with freedom and chearfulness to eat and drink their spiritual food. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sol 5:2</a></font></span></p>Asleep - I was dull, and sluggish. But - Yet in my very sleep my thoughts were running upon my beloved. It is - Between sleeping and waking, I heard his voice. Knocketh - By his word, and providence, and spirit, at the door of my heart. Open - Inviting me to let him into my soul. My love - This heap of kind compellations signifies Christ's fervent affection to his people. With dew - While I wait without thy door, which signifies his sufferings for the church's good. The drops - The dew which falls in the night. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sol 5:3</a></font></span></p>My coat - My day clothes, as persons use to do when they go to rest. How - It is inconvenient and troublesome to do it at this time. Washed my feet - Which the eastern people commonly did when they went to bed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#004">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sol 5:4</a></font></span></p>By the hole - He assayed to open the door. When his word would not prevail, his spirit, which is called the finger of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020">Luk 11:20</a>, wrought inwardly upon my conscience. Were moved - With compassion for him and his sufferings, and with affection to him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sol 5:5</a></font></span></p>I rose - I went forth to receive him. Dropped - With oil or ointment made of myrrh, which dropped from the bridegroom's hand upon the door in great abundance, when he put it into the hole of the door, and consequently upon her hands and fingers when she touched the door to open it. By which she signifies, that Christ, though he withdrew himself from her, yet left a sweet savour behind him. The handles - Heb. with myrrh passing or flowing upon the handles of the lock, which place the bridegroom had touched when he attempted to open it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sol 5:6</a></font></span></p>With - drawn - Denied me his comfortable presence, as a just punishment for my former neglect. Faded - Heb. went out of me: I fainted and was ready to die away, for those endearing expressions related, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002">Sol 5:2</a>, which then I did not heed. I sought - By diligent enquiry and importunate prayer. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#007">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sol 5:7</a></font></span></p>Watch - men - The governors of the church, who, though by their place they are obliged to comfort the faithful, do frequently discourage them. Smote - With bitter calumnies and persecutions. The keepers - The same with the watchmen, whose office it is to keep the gates and walls of the city. My vine - Which was an ornament of her sex, and an ensign of her relation to Christ. And so the taking of this veil away, signifies their contemptuous usage of her, and endeavours to represent her, as one that had no relation to Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sol 5:8</a></font></span></p>O daughters - The church having passed the watchmen, proceeds in the pursuit of her beloved, and enquires of every particular believer whom she meets concerning him. Tell him - That I am ready to faint for want of his presence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sol 5:9</a></font></span></p>What is - Wherein doth he excel them? Believers might ask this, that they might be more fully informed of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">sol 5:10</a></font></span></p>White - The white may denote his pure and spotless innocency, and the ruddy colour his bloody passion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sol 5:11</a></font></span></p>As gold - It shines like gold, by reason of the crown of pure gold upon his head. We need not aim at a distinct application of this and the following particulars, unto some special excellency of Christ, because such things are mere conjectures, and the only design of this description is, to set forth the beauty of Christ under the notion of a most amiable person, in whom there is no defect or blemish, from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#012">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:12</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">sol 5:13</a></font></span></p>Cheeks - His face or countenance, an eminent part whereof is the cheeks. Spices - Of aromatic flowers which delight both the eye with a pleasant prospect, and the smell with their fragrancy. Lillies - Beautiful and pleasant. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#014">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sol 5:14</a></font></span></p>Beryl - Beautiful, and precious, and richly adorned, as it were with gold rings set with precious stones. Belly - Which seems to be here used, for the whole body, reaching from the neck to the bottom of the belly. Saphires - Of a pure and bright white colour, intermixt with blue veins; for some saphires are of a bright blue colour. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">sol 5:15</a></font></span></p>Marble - White, and strait, and well shaped and strong.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">sol 5:16</a></font></span></p>Altogether - Not to run out into more particulars.
