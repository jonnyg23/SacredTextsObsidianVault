 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001">Ecclesiastes Chapter 2</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ecc 2:1</a></font></span></p>I said - Being disappointed of my hopes from knowledge, I resolved to try another course. Go to - O my soul! I will try whether I cannot make thee happy, by the enjoyment of sensual delights. Vanity - Is vain, and unable to make men happy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002">Ecclesiastes 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ecc 2:2</a></font></span></p>It is mad - This is an act of madness, more fit for fools who know nothing, than for wise men in this sinful, and dangerous, and deplorable state of mankind. What doth it - What good doth it? Or how can it make men happy? I challenge all the Epicures in the world to give me a solid answer. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ecc 2:3</a></font></span></p>To wine - To gratify myself with delicious meats and drinks. Yet - Yet resolving to use my wisdom, that I might try whether I could not arrive at satisfaction, by mixing wine and wisdom together. To lay hold - To pursue sensual pleasures, which was my folly. 'Till - 'Till I might find out the true way to contentment and satisfaction, during this mortal life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ecc 2:6</a></font></span></p>The wood - The nurseries of young trees, which for the multitude of them were like a wood or forest. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ecc 2:8</a></font></span></p>Peculiar treasure - The greatest jewels and rarities of other kings, which they gave to me, either as a tribute, or by way of present. Of provinces - Which were imposed upon or presented by all the provinces of my dominions. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009">Ecclesiastes 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ecc 2:9</a></font></span></p>Great - In riches, and power, and glory. My wisdom remained - As yet I was not wholly seduced from God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ecc 2:10</a></font></span></p>And - Whatsoever was grateful to my senses. Rejoiced - I had the comfort of all my labours, and was not hindered from the full enjoyment of them by sickness or war, or any other calamity. My portion - This present enjoyment of them, was all the benefit which I could expect from all my labours. So that I made the best of them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ecc 2:11</a></font></span></p>Vexation - I found myself wholly dissatisfied. No profit - The pleasure was past, and I was never the better for it, but as empty as before. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ecc 2:12</a></font></span></p>I turned - Being frustrated of my hopes in pleasure, I returned to a second consideration of my first choice, to see whether there was not more satisfaction to be gotten from wisdom, than I discovered at my first view. Done - As by others, so especially by myself. They can make no new discoveries as to this point. They can make no more of the pleasures of sense than I have done. Let me then try once more, whether wisdom can give happiness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013">Ecclesiastes 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ecc 2:13</a></font></span></p>I saw - I allowed thus much. Although wisdom is not sufficient to make men happy, yet it is of a far greater use than vain pleasures, or any other follies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ecc 2:14</a></font></span></p>Head - In their proper place. He hath the use of his eyes and reason, and foresees, and so avoids many dangers and mischiefs. Yet - Notwithstanding this excellency of wisdom above folly, at last they both come to one end. Both are subject to the same calamities, and to death itself, which takes away all difference between them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ecc 2:15</a></font></span></p>Why - What benefit have I by my wisdom? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ecc 2:16</a></font></span></p>For - Their memory, though it may flourish for a season, yet will in a little time be worn out; as we see it, most of the wise men of former ages, whose very names, together with all their monuments, are utterly lost. As the fool - He must die as certainly as the fool. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017">Ecclesiastes 2:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ecc 2:17</a></font></span></p>Life - My life was a burden to me. Is grievous - All human designs and works are so far from yielding me satisfaction, that the consideration of them increases my discontent. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">ecc 2:18</a></font></span></p>All my labour - All these riches and buildings, and other fruits of my labour, were aggravations of my misery. Because - Because I must, and that everlastingly, leave them all behind me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019">Ecclesiastes 2:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">ecc 2:19</a></font></span></p>Or a fool - Who will undo all that I have done, and turn the effects of my wisdom into instruments of his folly. Some think he had such an opinion of Rehoboam. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020">Ecclesiastes 2:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">ecc 2:20</a></font></span></p>Despair - I gave myself up to despair of ever reaping that satisfaction which I promised to myself. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021">Ecclesiastes 2:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">ecc 2:21</a></font></span></p>Wisdom - Who uses great industry, and prudence, and justice too, in the use and management of his affairs. To a man - Who has spent his days in sloth and folly. A great evil - A great disorder in itself, and a great torment to a considering mind. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022">Ecclesiastes 2:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">ecc 2:22</a></font></span></p>For what - What comfort or benefit remains to any man after this short and frail life is once ended? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023">Ecclesiastes 2:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">ecc 2:23</a></font></span></p>Sorrows - Full of sorrows. Tho' he took great and unwearied pains all his days, yet the toils of his body were accompanied with vexation of mind. His heart - Because his sleep was broken with perplexing cares. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">ecc 2:24</a></font></span></p>Enjoy - That he should thankfully take, and freely and chearfully enjoy the comforts which God gives him. It was - A singular gift of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025">Ecclesiastes 2:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">ecc 2:25</a></font></span></p>More than I - Therefore he could best tell whether they were able of themselves, without God's special gift, to yield a man content, in the enjoying of them. Who can pursue them with more diligence, obtain them with more readiness, or embrace them with more greediness? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">ecc 2:26</a></font></span></p>Wisdom - To direct him how to use his comforts aright; that so they may be blessings, and not curses to him. Joy - A thankful contented mind. To heap up - He giveth him up to insatiable desires, and wearisome labours, that he may leave it to others, yea to such as he least desired, to good and virtuous men.
