 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001">Acts Chapter 6</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001">Acts 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">act 6:1</a></font></span></p>There arose a murmuring - Here was the first breach made on those who were before of one heart and of one soul. Partiality crept in unawares on some; and murmuring on others. Ah Lord! how short a time did pure, genuine, undefiled Christianity remain in the world! O the depth! How unsearchable are thy counsels! Marvellous are thy ways, O King of saints! The Hellenists were Jews born out of Palestine. They were so called, because they used the Greek as their in other tongue. In this partiality of the Hebrews, and murmuring of the Hellenists, were the needs of a general persecution sown. Did God ever, in any age or country, withdraw his restraining providence, and let loose the world upon the Christians, till there was a cause among themselves? Is not an open, general persecution, always both penal and medicinal? A punishment of those that will not accept of milder reproofs, as well as a medicine to heal their sickness? And at the same time a means both of purifying and strengthening those whose heart is still right with God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002">Acts 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">act 6:2</a></font></span></p>It is not right that we should leave the word of God and serve tables - In the first Church, the primary business of apostles, evangelists, and bishops, was to preach the word of God; the secondary, to take a kind of paternal care (the Church being then like a family,) for the food, especially of the poor, the strangers, and the widows. Afterward, the deacons of both sexes were constituted for this latter business. And whatever time they had to spare from this, they employed in works of spiritual mercy. But their proper office was, to take care of the poor. And when some of them afterward preached the Gospel, they did this not by virtue of their deaconship, but of another commission, that of evangelists, which they probably received, not before, but after they were appointed deacons. And it is not unlikely that others were chosen deacons, or stewards, in their room, when any of these commenced evangelists. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003">Acts 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">act 6:3</a></font></span></p>Of good report - That there may be no room to suspect them of partiality or injustice. Full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom - For it is not a light matter to dispense even the temporal goods of the Church. To do even this well, a large measure both of the gifts and grace of God is requisite. Whom we will set over this business - It would have been happy for the Church, had its ordinary ministers in every age taken the same care to act in concert with the people committed to their charge, which the apostles themselves, extraordinary as their office was, did on this and other occasions. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004">Acts 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">act 6:4</a></font></span></p>We will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word - This is doubtless the proper business of a Christian bishop: to speak to God in prayer; to men in preaching his word, as an ambassador for Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005">Acts 6:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 6:5</a></font></span></p>And they chose - It seems seven Hellenists, as their names show. And Nicholas a proselyte - To whom the proselytes would the more readily apply. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007">Acts 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">act 6:7</a></font></span></p>And the word of God grew - The hinderances being removed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009">Acts 6:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">act 6:9</a></font></span></p>There arose certain of the synagogue which is called - It was one and the same synagogue which consisted of these several nations. Saul of Cilicia was doubtless a member of it; whence it is not at all improbable, that Gamaliel presided over it. Libertines - So they were styled, whose fathers were once slaves, and afterward made free. This was the ease of many Jews who had been taken captive by the Romans. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#014">Acts 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">act 6:14</a></font></span></p>We have heard him say - So they might. But yet the consequence they drew would not follow. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015">Acts 6:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">act 6:15</a></font></span></p>As the face of an angel - Covered with supernatural lustre. They reckoned his preaching of Jesus to be the Christ was destroying Moses and the law; and God bears witness to him, with the same glory as he did to Moses, when he gave the law by him.
