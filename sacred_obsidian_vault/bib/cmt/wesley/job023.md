 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001">Job Chapter 23</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002">Job 23:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 23:2</a></font></span></p>To - day - Even at this time, notwithstanding all your pretended consolations. Stroke - The hand or stroke of God upon me. Groaning - Doth exceed my complaints. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003">Job 23:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 23:3</a></font></span></p>O - I desire nothing more than his acquaintance and presence; but alas, he hides his face from me. Seat - To his throne or judgment - seat to plead my cause before him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005">Job 23:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 23:5</a></font></span></p>Know - If he should discover to me any secret sins, for which he contendeth with me, I would humble myself before him, and accept of the punishment of mine iniquity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 23:6</a></font></span></p>No - He would not use his power against me, but for me; by enabling me to plead my cause, and giving sentence according to that clemency, which he uses towards his children. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007">Job 23:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 23:7</a></font></span></p>There - At that throne of grace, where God lays aside his majesty, and judges according to his wonted clemency. Dispute - Humbly propounding the grounds of their confidence. So - Upon such a fair and equal hearing. Delivered - From the damnatory sentence of God. This and some such expressions of Job cannot be excused from irreverence towards God, for which God afterwards reproves him, and Job abhorreth himself. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008">Job 23:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 23:8</a></font></span></p>Is not - As a judge to hear and determine my causes, otherwise he knew God was essentially present in all places. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010">Job 23:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 23:10</a></font></span></p>Gold - Which comes out of the furnace pure from all dross. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011">Job 23:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 23:11</a></font></span></p>Steps - The steps or paths which God hath appointed men to walk in. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014">Job 23:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 23:14</a></font></span></p>Performeth - Those calamities which he hath allotted to me. And - There are many such examples of God's proceeding with men. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016">Job 23:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 23:16</a></font></span></p>Soft - He hath bruised, and broken, or melted it, so that I have no spirit in me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017">Job 23:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 23:17</a></font></span></p>Because - God did not cut me off by death. Before - These miseries came upon me. Covered - By hiding me in the grave.
