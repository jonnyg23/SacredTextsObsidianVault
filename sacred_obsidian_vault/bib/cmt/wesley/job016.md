 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#001">Job Chapter 16</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002">Job 16:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 16:2</a></font></span></p>Such things - These things are but vulgar and trivial. And so are all creatures, to a soul under deep conviction of sin, or the arrest of death. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003">Job 16:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 16:3</a></font></span></p>End - When wilt thou put an end to these impertinent discourses? He retorts upon him his charge, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002">Job 15:2-3</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#007">Job 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 16:7</a></font></span></p>He - God, as appears by the following words. Weary - Either of complaining, or, of my life. Desolate - Hast turned my society into desolation, by destroying my children and servants. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009">Job 16:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 16:9</a></font></span></p>Eyes - Looks upon me with a fierce, and sparkling eye, as enraged persons use to do. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010">Job 16:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 16:10</a></font></span></p>They - My friends. Gaped - Opened their mouths wide against me. In all this Job was a type of Christ. These very expressions are used in the predictions of his sufferings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013">Psa 22:13</a>. They gaped upon me with their mouths, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001">Mic 5:1</a>. They shall smite the judge of Israel upon the check. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011">Job 16:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 16:11</a></font></span></p>The wicked - And thus Christ was delivered into wicked hands, by the determinate counsel of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012">Job 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 16:12</a></font></span></p>Shaken - As a mighty man doth with some stripling, when he wrestleth with him. Mark - That he may shoot all his arrows in me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013">Job 16:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 16:13</a></font></span></p>His archers - Whoever are our enemies, we must look on them as God's archers, and see him directing the arrow. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015">Job 16:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 16:15</a></font></span></p>I have - So far am I from stretching out my hand against God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025">Job 15:25</a>, that I have humbled myself deeply under his hand. I have not only put on sackcloth, but sewed it on, as being resolved to continue my humiliation, as long as my affliction continues. Defiled my horn - I have willingly parted with all my wealth, and power, and glory (as the horn often signifies in scripture,) and been content to lie in the dust. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017">Job 16:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 16:17</a></font></span></p>Not - And all this is not come upon me for any injurious dealing, but for other reasons known to God only. Pure - I do not cast off God's fear and service, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004">Job 15:4</a>. I do still pray and worship God, and my prayer is accompanied with a sincere heart. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018">Job 16:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 16:18</a></font></span></p>Earth - The earth is said to cover that blood, which lies undiscovered and unrevenged: but saith Job, if I be guilty of destroying any man, let the earth disclose it; let it be brought to light. Cry - Let the cry of my complaints to men, or prayers to God, find no place in the ears or hearts of God or men, if this be true. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019">Job 16:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 16:19</a></font></span></p>Witness - Besides the witness of my conscience, God is witness of my integrity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#022">Job 16:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 16:22</a></font></span></p>Go - To the state and place of the dead, whence men cannot return to this life. The meaning is, my death hastens, and therefore I earnestly desire that the cause depending, between me and my friends, may be determined, that if I be guilty of these things, I may bear the shame of it before all men, and if I be innocent, that I may see my own integrity, and the credit of religion, (which suffers upon this occasion) vindicated. How very certainly, and how very shortly are we likewise to go this journey.
