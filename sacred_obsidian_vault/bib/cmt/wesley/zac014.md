 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001">Zechariah 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 14:1</a></font></span></p>The day - Of vengeance, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001">Joe 2:1-2</a>, cometh, or will soon overtake you, O sinful, unthankful! bloody! Jews. Thy spoil - All thou hast, O, Jerusalem, shall become a prey to thine enemy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zechariah 14:2</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zac 14:3</a></font></span></p>Then - After he hath sufficiently punished the Jews. As when he fought - As in those days when he fought for his people.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 14:5</a></font></span></p>The valley of the mountains - A place provided of God for their safety. O Lord my God - As if it were said, though it will, O Lord, put us into fear; yet without such wonderful works we shall not see thy salvation; therefore, O Lord my God come, and bring thy holy ones with thee. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006">Zechariah 14:6</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 14:7</a></font></span></p>One day - One continued day, no setting of the sun to make it quite night: God will always act in order to the full salvation of his spiritual Jerusalem.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 14:8</a></font></span></p>In that day - When the days of ignorance, and idolatry shall end. Living waters - The quickening, saving truths of the gospel, with all its ordinances in purity. From Jerusalem - The church of Christ, the true Jerusalem. The former sea - Or eastern sea. The hinder sea - Or western sea. In summer and in winter - Perpetually, without intermission, these waters shall never dry away, or lose their healing virtue. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009">Zechariah 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zac 14:9</a></font></span></p>In that day - All men shall agree in worshipping one God, in one way of spiritual worship, and hearty obedience. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010">Zechariah 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zac 14:10</a></font></span></p>All the land - The whole land of Judea, a type of the whole earth, shall be filled with the knowledge of God. As a plain - All high, uneven places, all rocky and barren grounds, shall be changed into fruitful vineyards. So the church of Christ shall be fruitful, humble and lovely. Geba - The north boundary of the land. Rimmon - The south boundary of Judea. Jerusalem - Which taken mystically, is the church of Christ, and by the repair of all to this Jerusalem, is shadowed out of the compleat building of the church on all sides, north, south, west and east. Lifted up - Raised out of the dust. Benjamin's gate - Benjamin's gate north - east, corner - gate north - west; Hananiel's tower south, wine - presses north; that is in brief, compleatly around the city. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011">Zechariah 14:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">zac 14:11</a></font></span></p>And men - Many for number, eminent for worth. Utter destruction - There may be afflictions but no utter wasting of Jerusalem; the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013">Zechariah 14:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">zac 14:13</a></font></span></p>A great tumult - Confusion. Shall rise up - From murmurs one against another they shall at last run into civil wars, and so destroy themselves, and revenge Jerusalem. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014">Zechariah 14:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">zac 14:14</a></font></span></p>Judah - The Jews, and possibly Judas Maccabeus might be intended. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#015">Zechariah 14:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">zac 14:15</a></font></span></p>The horse - Those creatures which the enemy in the wars made use of, shall by the hand of God be suddenly and strangely destroyed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016">Zechariah 14:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">zac 14:16</a></font></span></p>That is left - That escapes the stroke. To worship - By a ceremonial usage which shadowed out a better worship, the prophet foretells the constant zeal of the converted Gentiles to worship the Lord. The feast of tabernacles - One solemn festival is by a figure, put for all the days consecrated to God for holy worship. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020">Zechariah 14:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">zac 14:20</a></font></span></p>Shall there be - Written as it were on every common thing. Holiness unto the Lord - Their persons shall bear the dedicating inscription of holiness to the Lord, and by their study of holiness they shall make good their motto. The pots - Which were used in the kitchens of the temple, and were not accounted so sacred as the utensils near the sacrifices, and altar. The bowls - Which received the blood of the sacrifices, were esteemed more holy; so shall thy holiness in these days exceed the holiness of those former days. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021">Zechariah 14:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">zac 14:21</a></font></span></p>Every pot - The utensils of private houses shall be all dedicated to God's service. That sacrifice - So the prophet expresses all religious affections, practice, and worship, which shall be as pleasing to God, as were the sacrifices of his people offered up with divine warrant and approbation. Seethe therein - That part of the sacrifice which pertaineth to the priests, and to the offerer to feast on. The Canaanite - Any of the accursed nation, or one who makes merchandise of religion. But all shall know that the Lord hath the greatest pleasure in upright, and sincere love and holiness.
