 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001">Job Chapter 13</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001">Job 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 13:1</a></font></span></p>Lo - All this which either you or I have discoursed concerning the infinite power and wisdom of God. I know, both by seeing it, by my own observation and experience, and by hearing it from my ancestors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003">Job 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 13:3</a></font></span></p>Surely - I had rather debate the matter with God than with you. I am not afraid of presenting my person and cause before him, who is a witness of my integrity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008">Job 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 13:8</a></font></span></p>Accept - Not judging according to the right of the cause, but the quality or the person. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#012">Job 13:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 13:12</a></font></span></p>Remembrance - Mouldering and coming to nothing. And the consideration of our mortality should make us afraid of offending God. Your mementos are like unto ashes, contemptible and unprofitable. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014">Job 13:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 13:14</a></font></span></p>Wherefore - And this may be a reason of his desire of liberty of speech, because he could hold his tongue no longer, but must needs tear himself to pieces, if he had not some vent for his grief. The phrase having his life in his hand, denotes a condition extremely dangerous. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#017">Job 13:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 13:17</a></font></span></p>Hear - He now comes more closely to his business, the foregoing verses being mostly in way of preface. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018">Job 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 13:18</a></font></span></p>Behold - I have seriously considered the state of my case, and am ready to plead my cause. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019">Job 13:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 13:19</a></font></span></p>The ghost - My grief would break my heart, if I should not give it vent. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021">Job 13:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 13:21</a></font></span></p>Withdraw - Suspend my torments during the time of my pleading with thee, that my mind may be at liberty. Do not present thyself to me in terrible majesty, neither deal with me in rigorous justice. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022">Job 13:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 13:22</a></font></span></p>Then - This proposal savoured of self - confidence, and of irreverence towards God; for which, and the like speeches, he is reproved by God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002">Job 38:2-3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002">Job 40:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023">Job 13:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 13:23</a></font></span></p>My sin - That I am a sinner, I confess; but not that I am guilty of such crimes as my friends suppose, if it be so, do thou, O Lord, discover it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025">Job 13:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 13:25</a></font></span></p>Leaf - One that can no more resist thy power, than a leaf, or a little dry straw can resist the wind or fire. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026">Job 13:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">job 13:26</a></font></span></p>Writest - Thou appointest or inflictest. A metaphor from princes or judges, who anciently used to write their sentences. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#028">Job 13:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">job 13:28</a></font></span></p>He - He speaks of himself in the third person, as is usual in this and other sacred books. So the sense is, he, this poor frail creature, this body of mine; which possibly he pointed at with his finger, consumeth or pineth away.
