 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 31:2</a></font></span></p>He is safe - You think you are safe, in engaging the Egyptians; but God is not inferior to them in wisdom or strength, and therefore you have done foolishly, in preferring them before him, who will execute his judgments upon you, notwithstanding all the Egyptians can do. The help - The helpers, as it is explained in the next verse.

Passing over - The destroying angel shall pass over Jerusalem. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008">Isaiah 31:8</a></p>
