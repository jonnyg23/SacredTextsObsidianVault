 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001">2 Chronicles Chapter 26</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010">2 Chronicles 26:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">ch2 26:10</a></font></span></p>Towers - To guard his cattle from the inroads which the Arabians were accustomed to make: and to give notice of the approach of any enemy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016">2 Chronicles 26:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ch2 26:16</a></font></span></p>Into Jerusalem - Into the holy place, where the altar of incense stood, and into which none but the priests might enter, much less offer incense. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018">2 Chronicles 26:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">ch2 26:18</a></font></span></p>Withstood - Heb. stood up against Uzziah, not by force, or laying hands upon him to restrain him, for in the next verse you still find the censer in his hand; but only by admonition and reproof, which follows. Neither, &amp;c. - Expect that God will punish thee, or put some brand of infamy upon thee for this presumption. But this they express modestly, because they considered that he to whom they spake, though an offender, was their sovereign. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019">2 Chronicles 26:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">ch2 26:19</a></font></span></p>His forehead - So that he could not hide his shame: though it is probable it was also in the rest of his body. From beside - By a stroke from an invisible hand coming from the altar; that he might be assured this was the effect of God's displeasure. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020">2 Chronicles 26:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">ch2 26:20</a></font></span></p>Thrust - Not by force, which needed not, for he voluntarily hasted away, as it follows; but by vehement persuasions and denunciations of God's farther judgments upon him, if he did not depart. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021">2 Chronicles 26:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">ch2 26:21</a></font></span></p>His death - God would have this leprosy to be incurable, as a lasting monument of his anger against such presumptuous invaders of the priest's office. Dwelt, &amp;c. - As he was obliged to do by law, which he durst not now resist, being under the hand of God, and under the fear of worse plagues, if he did not so. For - He dwelt in a several house, because he might not come into the temple or courts, nor consequently into any publick assembly. So the punishment answered the sin, as face does to face in a glass. He thrust himself into the temple of God, whether the priests only had admission: and for that was thrust out of the very courts of the temple, into which the meanest of, his subjects might enter. He invaded the dignity of the priesthood, to which he had no right, and is for that deprived of the royal dignity, to which he had an undoubted right.
