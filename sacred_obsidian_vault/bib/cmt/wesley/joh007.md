 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001">John Chapter 7</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001">John 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">joh 7:1</a></font></span></p>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee - That is, continued there, for some months after the second passover. For he would not walk - Continue in Judea; because the Jews - Those of them who did not believe; and in particular the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, sought an opportunity to kill him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002">John 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">joh 7:2</a></font></span></p>The feast of tabernacles - The time, manner, and reason of this feast may be seen, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034">Lev 23:34</a>, &amp;c. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003">John 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">joh 7:3</a></font></span></p>His brethren - So called according to the Jewish way of speaking. They were his cousins, the sons of his mother's sister. Depart hence - From this obscure place. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004">John 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">joh 7:4</a></font></span></p>For no man doth any thing - Of this kind, in secret; but rather desireth to be of public use. If thou really dost these things - These miracles which are reported; show thyself to the world - To all men. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006">John 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">joh 7:6</a></font></span></p>Jesus saith, Your time is always ready - This or any time will suit you. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007">John 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joh 7:7</a></font></span></p>The world cannot hate you - Because ye are of the world. But me it hateth - And all that bear the same testimony. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010">John 7:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">joh 7:10</a></font></span></p>He also went up to the feast - This was his last journey but one to Jerusalem. The next time he went up he suffered. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#011">John 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joh 7:11</a></font></span></p>The Jews - The men of Judea, particularly of Jerusalem. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012">John 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">joh 7:12</a></font></span></p>There was much murmuring among the multitude - Much whispering; many private debates with each other, among those who were come from distant parts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013">John 7:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">joh 7:13</a></font></span></p>However no man spake openly of him - Not in favour of him: for fear of the Jews - Those that were in authority. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014">John 7:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">joh 7:14</a></font></span></p>Now at the middle of the feast - Which lasted eight days. It is probable this was on the Sabbath day. Jesus went up into the temple - Directly, without stopping any where else. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015">John 7:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">joh 7:15</a></font></span></p>How does this man know letters, having never learned? - How comes he to be so well acquainted with sacred literature as to be able thus to expound the Scripture, with such propriety and gracefulness, seeing he has never learned this, at any place of education? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016">John 7:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">joh 7:16</a></font></span></p>My doctrine is not mine - Acquired by any labour of learning; but his that sent me - Immediately infused by him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017">John 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">joh 7:17</a></font></span></p>If any man be willing to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God - This is a universal rule, with regard to all persons and doctrines. He that is thoroughly willing to do it, shall certainly know what the will of God is. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018">John 7:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">joh 7:18</a></font></span></p>There is no unrighteousness in him - No deceit or falsehood. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019">John 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">joh 7:19</a></font></span></p>But ye are unrighteous; for ye violate the very law which ye profess so much zeal for. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020">John 7:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">joh 7:20</a></font></span></p>The people answered, Thou hast a devil - A lying spirit. Who seeketh to kill thee? - These, coming from distant parts, probably did not know the design of the priests and rulers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021">John 7:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">joh 7:21</a></font></span></p>I did - At the pool of Bethesda: one work - Out of many: and ye all marvelled at it - Are amazed, because I did it on the Sabbath day. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022">John 7:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">joh 7:22</a></font></span></p>Moses gave you circumcision - The sense is, because Moses enjoined you circumcision (though indeed it was far more ancient than him) you think it no harm to circumcise a man on the Sabbath: and are ye angry at me (which anger had now continued sixteen months) for doing so much greater a good, for healing a man, body and soul, on the Sabbath? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027">John 7:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">joh 7:27</a></font></span></p>When Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is - This Jewish tradition was true, with regard to his Divine nature: in that respect none could declare his generation. But it was not true with regard to his human nature, for both his family and the place of his birth were plainly foretold. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028">John 7:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">joh 7:28</a></font></span></p>Then cried Jesus - With a loud and earnest voice. Do ye both know me, and know whence I am ? - Ye do indeed know whence I am as a man. But ye know not my Divine nature, nor that I am sent from God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029">John 7:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">joh 7:29</a></font></span></p>l am from him - By eternal generation: and he hath sent me - His mission follows from his generation. These two points answer those: Do ye know me? Do ye know whence I am? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030">John 7:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">joh 7:30</a></font></span></p>His hour - The time of his suffering. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033">John 7:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">joh 7:33</a></font></span></p>Then said Jesus - Continuing his discourse (from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029">Joh 7:29</a>) which they had interrupted. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034">John 7:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">joh 7:34</a></font></span></p>Ye shall seek me - Whom ye now despise. These words are, as it were, the text which is commented upon in this and the following chapter. Where I am - Christ's so frequently saying while on earth, where I am, when he spake of his being in heaven, intimates his perpetual presence there in his Divine nature: though his going thither was a future thing, with regard to his human nature. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035">John 7:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">joh 7:35</a></font></span></p>Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks - The Jews scattered abroad in heathen nations, Greece particularly. Or, Will he teach the Greeks? - The heathens themselves. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037">John 7:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">joh 7:37</a></font></span></p>On the last, the great day of the feast - On this day there was the greatest concourse of people, and they were then wont to fetch water from the fountain of Siloam, which the priests poured out on the great altar, singing one to an other, With joy shall ye draw water from the wells of salvation. On this day likewise they commemorated God's miraculously giving water out of the rock, and offered up solemn prayers for seasonable rains. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038">John 7:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">joh 7:38</a></font></span></p>He that believeth - This answers to let him come to me. And whosoever doth come to him by faith, his inmost soul shall be filled with living water, with abundance of peace, joy, and love, which shall likewise flow from him to others. As the Scripture hath said - Not expressly in any one particular place. But here is a general reference to all those scriptures which speak of the effusion of the Spirit by the Messiah, under the similitude of pouring out water. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008">Zac 14:8</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039">John 7:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">joh 7:39</a></font></span></p>The Holy Ghost was not yet given - That is, those fruits of the Spirit were not yet given even to true believers, in that full measure. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040">John 7:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">joh 7:40</a></font></span></p>The prophet - Whom we expect to be the forerunner of the Messiah. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042">John 7:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">joh 7:42</a></font></span></p>From Bethlehem - And how could they forget that Jesus was born there? Had not Herod given them terrible reason to remember it? <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048">John 7:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">joh 7:48</a></font></span></p>Hath any of the rulers - Men of rank or eminence, or of the Pharisees - Men of learning or religion, believed on him? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049">John 7:49</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">joh 7:49</a></font></span></p>But this populace, who know not the law - This ignorant rabble; are accursed - Are by that ignorance exposed to the curse of being thus seduced. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050">John 7:50</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_050">joh 7:50</a></font></span></p>Nicodemus, he that came to him by night - Having now a little more courage, being one of them - Being present as a member of the great council, saith to them - Do not we ourselves act as if we knew not the law, if we pass sentence on a man before we hear him? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052">John 7:52</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_052">joh 7:52</a></font></span></p>They answered - By personal reflection; the argument they could not answer, and therefore did not attempt it. Art thou also a Galilean? - One of his party? Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet - They could not but know the contrary. They knew Jonah arose out of Gethhepher; and Nahum from another village in Galilee. Yea, and Thisbe, the town of Elijah, the Tishbite, was in Galilee also. They might likewise have known that Jesus was not born in Galilee, but at Bethlehem, even from the public register there, and from the genealogies of the family of David. They were conscious this poor answer would not bear examination, and so took care to prevent a reply. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053">John 7:53</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_053">joh 7:53</a></font></span></p>And every man went to his own house - So that short plain question of Nicodemus spoiled all their measures, and broke up the council! A word spoken in season, how good it is! Especially when God gives it his blessing.
