 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001">Zechariah 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 3:1</a></font></span></p>And he - The Lord represented to me in a vision. Standing - Ministering in his office. The angel - Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002">Zechariah 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">zac 3:2</a></font></span></p>The Lord - Christ, as a mediator, rather chuses to rebuke him in his father's name, than in his own. Is not this - Joshua. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003">Zechariah 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zac 3:3</a></font></span></p>With filthy garments - The emblem of a poor or sinful state. The angel - Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004">Zechariah 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">zac 3:4</a></font></span></p>And he - Christ. Unto those - Ministerial angels. I have caused - What angels could not take away, Christ did; he removed the filth of sin, the guilt and stain of it. With change of raiment - Clean and rich, the emblem of holiness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005">Zechariah 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 3:5</a></font></span></p>I said - Zechariah takes the boldness to desire that for Joshua, which might add to his authority, and he asks the thing of Christ. A fair mitre - The proper ornament for the head of the high - priest. With garments - All the garments which appertained to the high priest. The angel - Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#006">Zechariah 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 3:6</a></font></span></p>Protested - Solemnly declared. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007">Zechariah 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 3:7</a></font></span></p>My charge - The special charge and office of the high - priest. Judge - Be ruler in the temple, and in the things that pertain to the worship of God there. Keep - Not as a servant, but as the chief, on whom others wait, and at last thou shalt have place among my angels. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zechariah 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 3:8</a></font></span></p>Thy fellows - Thy associates in the priestly office. That sit - As assessors in a council. Wondered at - The unbelieving Jews wonder at them; at their labour and expense in attempting to build such a house. Bring forth - God the Father will bring forth a much more wonderful work. The Branch - The Messiah. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009">Zechariah 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zac 3:9</a></font></span></p>Behold - Behold (pointing to a particular stone) that stone which I have laid in the sight of Joshua. Upon one stone - On that stone are seven eyes, probably so placed, that they may look many ways; so it was a more exact emblem of Christ, and of his perfect knowledge and wisdom. I have removed - I have pardoned the iniquity of this land at once. The temple, founded on such a corner - stone, guarded and watched over by all - seeing Providence, is the blessing and honour of that people, whose sins are all forgiven. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010">Zechariah 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zac 3:10</a></font></span></p>In that day - Of removing the sins of my people. Shall ye call - Ye shall invite one another to refresh yourselves with the sweet fruit of the vine and fig - tree. When iniquity is taken away, we receive precious benefits from our justification, more precious than the fruits of the vine or fig - tree. And we repose ourselves in sweet tranquillity, being quiet from the fear of evil.
