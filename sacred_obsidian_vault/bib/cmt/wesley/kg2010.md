 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">kg2 10:7</a></font></span></p>Sent them - Jehu justly required this, because the sovereign lord of all mens lives commanded it, but the Samaritans wickedly obeyed it, without any knowledge of, or regard to God's command. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011">4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:11</a></p>

Coming - To congratulate with him, for the destruction of that wicked family; and to encourage him to proceed in fulfilling the will of God. Him - Jehu saluted Jehonadab. Is, &amp;c. - Dost thou heartily approve of me, and my present proceedings. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#018">4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg2 10:18</a></font></span></p>Jehu said - The words being manifestly false, and spoken with a design to deceive, cannot be excused, this being an unmovable principle, That we must not do the least evil, that the greatest good may come.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">kg2 10:25</a></font></span></p>City - To some buildings belonging to this house of Baal, which may be here called the city; because they were very numerous and capacious. For as there were divers chambers and rooms built without the temple, belonging to it, for the use of the priests, and Levites. So it may probably be conceived, That this famous temple of Baal had many such buildings; in some of which, the priests of Baal, or of the groves, (whereof there were great numbers belonging to the king's court, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019">Kg1 18:19</a>,) peradventure might dwell; and others of them might be for divers uses belonging to the house, and service of Baal.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">kg2 10:29</a></font></span></p>Jehu departed not - So that it is plain, his religion was but superficial: otherwise it would not have given way to his policy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030">4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">kg2 10:30</a></font></span></p>Done well - In part, and so far as is here expressed.
