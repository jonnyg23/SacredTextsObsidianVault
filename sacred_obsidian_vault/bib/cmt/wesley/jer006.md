 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001">Jeremiah 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 6:1</a></font></span></p>Benjamin - Judah, when the ten tribes fell off, the tribe of Benjamin adhered to Judah, and was incorporated into them; if it be asked why the prophet rather speaks to Benjamin than to Judah, the reason probably may be, because he being of Anathoth was of that tribe, and therefore mentions them as his own countrymen. Gather - Gather yourselves together by the sound of the trumpet at Tekoa, one of those fenced cities twelve miles from Jerusalem that Rehoboam built. A sign - Fire a beacon. Beth - haccerem - Signifies the house of the vineyard, probably some high tower built among the vineyards for the keepers of them to watch them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003">Jeremiah 6:3</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jer 6:4</a></font></span></p>Prepare - These seem to be the words of God calling them to this work. Arise - This shews how ready they will be to obey God's call. The day goeth - We delay, and tarry too long, and the day spends apace. The shadows - They were so eagerly set upon it, that they watched the lengthening of the shadow, which shews the approach of the evening. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#005">Jeremiah 6:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 6:5</a></font></span></p>This night - They would lose neither day nor night; which shews that, they were extraordinarily stirred up by God in this expedition. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006">Jeremiah 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 6:6</a></font></span></p>Said - To the Chaldeans: God would have the Jews to know, that they have not so much to do with the Chaldeans as with him; that they are his rod to scourge them for their sins. And thus God is said to hiss for such whom he will employ in such work, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026">Isa 5:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018">Isa 7:18</a>. And he styles himself the Lord of hosts, to shew that it is in vain to contend in battle with them, whom he sends forth.

Depart - Heb. be disjointed, a most emphatical metaphor, whereby God would express how great grief it is to him to withdraw himself from them, even like the separating one limb from another.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 6:9</a></font></span></p>Glean - Judah shalt be gleaned over and over, 'till there be a full end, none left. Turn back - As much as to say, they should not be content with one spoiling, but they should go back a second and a third time, to carry away both persons and spoil.
