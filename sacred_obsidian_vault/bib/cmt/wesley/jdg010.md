 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001">Judges Chapter 10</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001">Judges 10:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jdg 10:1</a></font></span></p>There arose - Not of himself, but raised by God, as the other judges were. To defend - Or, to save, which he did not by fighting against, and overthrowing their enemies, but by a prudent and pious government of them, whereby he kept them from sedition, oppression, and idolatry. In Shamir - Which was in the very midst of the land. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#003">Judges 10:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jdg 10:3</a></font></span></p>A Gileadite - Of Gilead beyond Jordan. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004">Judges 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jdg 10:4</a></font></span></p>And he had thirty sons - They were itinerant judges, who rode from place to place, as their father's deputies to administer justice. Havoth - jair - These villages were called so before this time from another Jair, but the old name was revived and confirmed upon this occasion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006">Judges 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jdg 10:6</a></font></span></p>Forsook the Lord - They grew worse and worse, and so ripened themselves for ruin. Before they worshipped God and idols together, now they forsake God, and wholly cleave to idols. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#007">Judges 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jdg 10:7</a></font></span></p>Philistines, &amp;c. - The one on the west, the other on the east; so they were molested on both sides. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008">Judges 10:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jdg 10:8</a></font></span></p>That year - Or, that year they had vexed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years - This was the eighteenth year from the beginning of that oppression. And these eighteen years are not to be reckoned from Jair's death, because that would enlarge the time of the judges beyond the just bounds; but from the fourth year of Jair's reign: so that the greatest part of Jair's reign was contemporary with this affliction. The case of Jair and Samson seem to be much alike. For as it is said of Samson, that he judged Israel in the days of the tyranny of the Philistines, twenty years, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#020">Jdg 15:20</a>, by which it is evident, that his judicature, and their dominion, were contemporary; the like is to be conceived of Jair, that he began to judge Israel, and endeavoured to reform religion, and purge out all abuses; but being unable to effect this through the backwardness of the, people, God would not enable him to deliver the people, but gave them up to this sad oppression; so that Jair could only determine differences amongst the Israelites, but could not deliver them from their enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010">Judges 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jdg 10:10</a></font></span></p>And served also - Because not contented to add idols to thee, we have preferred them before thee. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011">Judges 10:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jdg 10:11</a></font></span></p>The Lord said - Either by some prophet whom he raised and sent for this purpose: or by the high - priest, who was consulted in the case. From the Amorites - Both Sihon and Og, and their people, and other kings of the Amorites within Jordan. Of Ammon - Who were confederate with the Moabites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013">Jdg 3:13-14</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#012">Judges 10:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jdg 10:12</a></font></span></p>The Zidonians - We do not read of any oppression of Israel, particularly, by the Zidonians. But many things were done, which are not recorded. The Maonites - Either first, those who lived in, or near the wilderness of Maon, in the south of Judah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025">Sa1 23:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002">Sa1 25:2</a>, whether Edomites or others. Or, secondly, the Mehunims, a people living near the Arabians, of whom, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007">Ch2 26:7</a>. For in the Hebrew, the letters of both names are the same, only the one is the singular, the other the plural number. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#013">Judges 10:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jdg 10:13</a></font></span></p>No more - Except you repent in another manner than you yet have done; which when they performed, God suspended the execution of this threatning. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014">Judges 10:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jdg 10:14</a></font></span></p>Chosen - You have not been forced to worship those gods by your oppressors; but you have freely chosen them before me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015">Judges 10:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jdg 10:15</a></font></span></p>Do thou unto us - Do not give us up into the hands of these cruel men, but do thou chastise us with thine own hand as much as thou pleasest; if we be not more faithful and constant to thee, than we have hitherto been. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016">Judges 10:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jdg 10:16</a></font></span></p>They put away - This was an evidence of the sincerity of their sorrow, that they did not only confess their sins, but also forsake them. His soul, &amp;c. - He acted towards them, like one that felt their sufferings; he had pity upon them, quite changed his carriage towards them, and punished their enemies as sorely as if they had grieved and injured his own person. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017">Judges 10:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jdg 10:17</a></font></span></p>Mizpeh - That Mizpeh which was beyond Jordan.
