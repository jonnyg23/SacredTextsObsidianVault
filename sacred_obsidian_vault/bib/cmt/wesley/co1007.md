 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001">1 Corinthians Chapter 7</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001">1 Corinthians 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co1 7:1</a></font></span></p>It is good for a man - Who is master of himself. Not to touch a women - That is, not to marry. So great and many are the advantages of a single life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002">1 Corinthians 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co1 7:2</a></font></span></p>Yet, when it is needful, in order to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife. His own - For Christianity allows no polygamy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003">1 Corinthians 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co1 7:3</a></font></span></p>Let not married persons fancy that there is any perfection in living with each other, as if they were unmarried. The debt - This ancient reading seems far more natural than the common one. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004">1 Corinthians 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co1 7:4</a></font></span></p>The wife - the husband - Let no one forget this, on pretence of greater purity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005">1 Corinthians 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co1 7:5</a></font></span></p>Unless it be by consent for a time - That on those special and solemn occasions ye may entirely give yourselves up to the exercises of devotion. Lest - If ye should long remain separate. Satan tempt you - To unclean thoughts, if not actions too. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006">1 Corinthians 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co1 7:6</a></font></span></p>But I say this - Concerning your separating for a time and coming together again. Perhaps he refers also to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002">Co1 7:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007">1 Corinthians 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co1 7:7</a></font></span></p>For I would that all men were herein even as I - I would that all believers who are now unmarried would remain "eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake" St. Paul, having tasted the sweetness of this liberty, wished others to enjoy it, as well as himself. But every one hath his proper gift from God - According to our Lord's declaration, "All men cannot receive this saying, save they," the happy few, to whom it is given," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#011">Mat 19:11</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008">1 Corinthians 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co1 7:8</a></font></span></p>It is good for them if they remain even as I - That St. Paul was then single is certain and from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058">Act 7:58</a>, compared with the following parts of the history, it seems probable that he always was so. It does not appear that this declaration, any more than <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001">Co1 7:1</a>, hath any reference at all to a state of persecution. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010">1 Corinthians 7:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co1 7:10</a></font></span></p>Not I - Only. But the Lord - Christ; by his express command, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032">Mat 5:32</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#011">1 Corinthians 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co1 7:11</a></font></span></p>But if she depart - Contrary to this express prohibition. And let not the husband put away his wife - Except for the cause of adultery. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012">1 Corinthians 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co1 7:12</a></font></span></p>To the rest - Who are married to unbelievers. Speak I - By revelation from God, though our Lord hath not left any commandment concerning it. Let him not put her away - The Jews, indeed, were obliged of old to put away their idolatrous wives, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003">Ezr 10:3</a>; but their case was quite different. They were absolutely forbid to marry idolatrous women; but the persons here spoken of were married while they were both in a state of heathenism. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014">1 Corinthians 7:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">co1 7:14</a></font></span></p>For the unbelieving husband hath, in many instances, been sanctified by the wife - Else your children would have been brought up heathens; whereas now they are Christians. As if he had said, Ye see the proof of it before your eyes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015">1 Corinthians 7:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co1 7:15</a></font></span></p>A brother or a sister - A Christian man or woman. Is not enslaved - is at full liberty. In such cases: but God hath called us to peace - To live peaceably with them, if it be possible. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017">1 Corinthians 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co1 7:17</a></font></span></p>But as God hath distributed - The various stations of life, and various relations, to every one, let him take care to discharge his duty therein. The gospel disannuls none of these. And thus I ordain in all the churches - As a point of the highest concern. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019">1 Corinthians 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">co1 7:19</a></font></span></p>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing - Will neither promote nor obstruct our salvation. The one point is, keeping the commandments of God; "faith working by love." 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020">1 Corinthians 7:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">co1 7:20</a></font></span></p>In the calling - The outward state. Wherein he is - When God calls him. Let him not seek to change this, without a clear direction from Providence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021">1 Corinthians 7:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">co1 7:21</a></font></span></p>Care not for it - Do not anxiously seek liberty. But if thou canst be free, use it rather - Embrace the opportunity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022">1 Corinthians 7:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">co1 7:22</a></font></span></p>Is the Lord's freeman - Is free in this respect. The Greek word implies one that was a slave, but now is free. Is the bondman of Christ - Not free in this respect; not at liberty to do his own will. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023">1 Corinthians 7:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">co1 7:23</a></font></span></p>Ye are bought with a price - Ye belong to God; therefore, where it can be avoided, do not become the bondslaves of men - Which may expose you to many temptations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024">1 Corinthians 7:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">co1 7:24</a></font></span></p>Therein abide with God - Doing all things as unto God, and as in his immediate presence. They who thus abide with God preserve an holy indifference with regard to outward things. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025">1 Corinthians 7:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">co1 7:25</a></font></span></p>Now concerning virgins - Of either sex. I have no commandment from the Lord - By a particular revelation. Nor was it necessary he should; for the apostles wrote nothing which was not divinely inspired: but with this difference, - sometimes they had a particular revelation, and a special commandment; at other times they wrote from the divine light which abode with them, the standing treasure of the Spirit of God. And this, also, was not their private opinion, but a divine rule of faith and practice. As one whom God hath made faithful in my apostolic office; who therefore faithfully deliver what I receive from him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026">1 Corinthians 7:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">co1 7:26</a></font></span></p>This is good for the present distress - While any church is under persecution. For a man to continue as he is - Whether married or unmarried. St. Paul does not here urge the present distress as a reason for celibacy, any more than for marriage; but for a man's not seeking to alter his state, whatever it be, but making the best of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#028">1 Corinthians 7:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">co1 7:28</a></font></span></p>Such will have trouble in the flesh - Many outward troubles. But I spare you - I speak as little and as tenderly as possible. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029">1 Corinthians 7:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">co1 7:29</a></font></span></p>But this I say, brethren - With great confidence. The time of our abode here is short. It plainly follows, that even they who have wives be as serious, zealous, active, dead to the world, as devoted to God, as holy in all manner of conversation, as if they had none - By so easy a transition does the apostle slide from every thing else to the one thing needful; and, forgetting whatever is temporal, is swallowed up in eternity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#030">1 Corinthians 7:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">co1 7:30</a></font></span></p>And they that weep, as if they wept not - "Though sorrowful, yet always rejoicing." They that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not - Tempering their joy with godly fear. They that buy, as if they possessed not - Knowing themselves to be only stewards, not proprietors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">1 Corinthians 7:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">co1 7:31</a></font></span></p>And they that use this world, as not abusing it - Not seeking happiness in it, but in God: using every thing therein only in such a manner and degree as most tends to the knowledge and love of God. For the whole scheme and fashion of this world - This marrying, weeping, rejoicing, and all the rest, not only will pass, but now passeth away, is this moment flying off like a shadow. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032">1 Corinthians 7:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">co1 7:32</a></font></span></p>Now I would have you - For this flying moment. Without carefulness - Without any incumbrance of your thoughts. The unmarried man - If he understand and use the advantage he enjoys - Careth only for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#033">1 Corinthians 7:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">co1 7:33</a></font></span></p>But the married careth for the things of the world - And it in his duty so to do, so far as becomes a Christian. How he may please his wife - And provide all things needful for her and his family. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034">1 Corinthians 7:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">co1 7:34</a></font></span></p>There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin - Whether the church be under persecution or not. The unmarried woman - If she know and use her privilege. Careth only for the things of the Lord - All her time, care, and thoughts centre in this, how she may be holy both in body and spirit. This is the standing advantage of a single life, in all ages and nations. But who makes a suitable use of it? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035">1 Corinthians 7:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">co1 7:35</a></font></span></p>Not that I may cast a snare upon you - Who are not able to receive this saying. But for your profit - Who are able. That ye may resolutely and perseveringly wait upon the Lord - The word translated wait signifies sitting close by a person, in a good posture to hear. So Mary sat at the feet of Jesus, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039">Luk 10:39</a>. Without distraction - Without having the mind drawn any way from its centre; from its close attention to God; by any person, or thing, or care, or incumbrance whatsoever. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036">1 Corinthians 7:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">co1 7:36</a></font></span></p>But if any parent think he should otherwise act indecently - Unbecoming his character. Toward his virgin daughter, if she be above age, (or of full age,) and need so require, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009">Co1 7:9</a>, let them marry - Her suitor and she. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037">1 Corinthians 7:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">co1 7:37</a></font></span></p>Having no necessity - Where there is no such need. But having power over his own will - Which would incline him to desire the increase of his family, and the strengthening it by new relations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#038">1 Corinthians 7:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">co1 7:38</a></font></span></p>Doeth better - If there be no necessity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039">1 Corinthians 7:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">co1 7:39</a></font></span></p>Only in the Lord - That is, only if Christians marry Christians: a standing direction, and one of the utmost importance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040">1 Corinthians 7:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">co1 7:40</a></font></span></p>I also - As well as any of you. Have the Spirit of God - Teaching me all things This does not imply any doubt; but the strongest certainty of it, together with a reproof of them for calling it in question. Whoever, therefore, would conclude from hence, that St. Paul was not certain he had the Spirit of Christ, neither understands the true import of the words, nor considers how expressly he lays claim to the Spirit, both in this epistle, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016">Co1 2:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037">Co1 14:37</a>, and the other. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003">Co2 13:3</a>. Indeed, it may be doubted whether the word here and elsewhere translated think, does not always imply the fullest and strongest assurance. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012">Co1 10:12</a>.
