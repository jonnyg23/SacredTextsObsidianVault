 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001">Luke 12:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">luk 12:1</a></font></span></p>He said to his disciples first - But afterward <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054">Luk 12:54</a> to all the people. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006">Mat 16:6</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">luk 12:5</a></font></span></p>Fear him who hath power to cast into hell - Even to his peculiar friends, Christ gives this direction.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">luk 12:6</a></font></span></p>Are not five sparrows - But trust as well as fear him.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">luk 12:11</a></font></span></p>Take no thought - Be not solicitous about the matter or manner of your defence; nor how to express yourselves. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019">Mat 10:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#012">Luk 21:12</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014">Luke 12:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">luk 12:14</a></font></span></p>Who made me a judge? - In worldly things. His kingdom is not of this world. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015">Luke 12:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">luk 12:15</a></font></span></p>He said to them - Perhaps to the two brothers, and through them to the people. A man's life - That is, the comfort or happiness of it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">luk 12:20</a></font></span></p>Thou fool - To think of satisfying thy soul with earthly goods! To depend on living many years! Yea, one day! They - The messengers of death, commissioned by God, require thy soul of thee!

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">luk 12:21</a></font></span></p>Rich toward God - Namely, in faith, and love, and good works.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#028">Luke 12:28</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">luk 12:29</a></font></span></p>Neither be ye of a doubtful mind - The word in the original signifies, any speculations or musings in which the mind fluctuates, or is suspended (like meteors in the air) in an uneasy hesitation. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032">Luke 12:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">luk 12:32</a></font></span></p>It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom - How much more food and raiment? And since ye have such an inheritance, regard not your earthly possessions. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033">Luke 12:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">luk 12:33</a></font></span></p>Sell what ye have - This is a direction, not given to all the multitude: (much less is it a standing rule for all Christians:) neither to the apostles; for they had nothing to sell, having left all before: but to his other disciples, (mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022">Luk 12:22</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015">Act 1:15</a>,) especially to the seventy, that they might be free from all worldly entanglements. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019">Mat 6:19</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">luk 12:37</a></font></span></p>He will come and serve them - The meaning is, he will show them his love, in the most condescending and tender manner. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038">Luke 12:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">luk 12:38</a></font></span></p>The Jews frequently divided the night into three watches, to which our Lord seems here to allude.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">luk 12:41</a></font></span></p>Speakest thou this parable to us - Apostles and disciples: Or to all - The people? Does it concern us alone? Or all men? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042">Luke 12:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">luk 12:42</a></font></span></p>Who is that faithful and wise steward - Our Lord's answer manifestly implies, that he had spoken this parable primarily (though not wholly) to the ministers of his word: Whom his lord shall make ruler over his household - For his wisdom and faithfulness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#043">Luke 12:43</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_043">luk 12:43</a></font></span></p>Happy is that servant - God himself pronounces him wise, faithful, happy! Yet we see, he might fall from all, and perish for ever. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046">Luke 12:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">luk 12:46</a></font></span></p>The Lord will appoint him his portion - His everlasting portion, with the unfaithful - As faithful as he was once, God himself being the Judge!

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051">Luke 12:51</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_051">luk 12:51</a></font></span></p>Suppose ye that I am come to send peace upon earth - That universal peace will be the immediate effect of my coming? Not so, but quite the contrary. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034">Mat 10:34</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#052">Luke 12:52</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_052">luk 12:52</a></font></span></p>There shall be five in one house, three against two, and two against three - There being an irreconcilable enmity between the Spirit of Christ and the spirit of the world.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_053">luk 12:53</a></font></span></p>The father against the son - For those who reject me will be implacable toward their very nearest relations who receive me. At this day also is this scripture fulfilled. Now likewise there is no concord between Christ and Belial.

From the west - In Judea, the west wind, blowing from the sea, usually brought rain: the south wind, blowing from the deserts of Arabia, occasioned sultry heat. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002">Mat 16:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#056">Luke 12:56</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_056">luk 12:56</a></font></span></p>How do ye not discern this season - Of the Messiah's coming, distinguishable by so many surer signs. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#057">Luke 12:57</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_057">luk 12:57</a></font></span></p>Why even of yourselves, without any external sign, judge ye not what is right? - Why do ye not discern and acknowledge the intrinsic excellence of my doctrine?
