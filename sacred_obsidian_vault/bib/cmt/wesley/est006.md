 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001">Esther Chapter 6</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001">Esther 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">est 6:1</a></font></span></p>Sleep - How vain are all the contrivances of foolish man against the wise and omnipotent God, who hath the hearts and hands of kings and all men perfectly at his disposal, and can by such trivial accidents (as they are accounted) change their minds, and produce such terrible effects. Were read - His mind being troubled he knew not how, nor why, he chuses this for a diversion, God putting this thought into him, for otherwise he might have diverted himself, as he used to do, with his wives or concubines, or voices and instruments of musick, which were far more agreeable to his temper. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#003">Esther 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">est 6:3</a></font></span></p>Nothing - He hath had no recompence for this great and good service. Which might either happen through the king's forgetfulness; or through the envy of the courtiers; or because he was a Jew, and therefore odious and contemptible. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004">Esther 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">est 6:4</a></font></span></p>Haman - Early in the morning, because his malice would not suffer him to sleep; and he was impatient 'till he had executed his revenge; and was resolved to watch for the very first opportunity of speaking to the king, before he was engaged in other matters. Outward court - Where he waited; because it was dangerous to come into the inner court without special license, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011">Est 4:11</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#006">Esther 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">est 6:6</a></font></span></p>Man - He names none, because he would have the more impartial answer. And probably knew nothing of the difference between Haman and Mordecai. Thought - As he had great reason to do, because of the favour which the king had shewed to him above all others. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008">Esther 6:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">est 6:8</a></font></span></p>Royal apparel - His outward garment, which was made of purple, interwoven with gold, as Justin and Cartius relate. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012">Esther 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">est 6:12</a></font></span></p>Gate - To his former place; shewing that as he was not overwhelmed by Haman's threats, so he was not puffed up with this honour. Cover'd - In token of his shame and grief for his unexpected disappointment, and for the great honour done to his abhorred adversary, by his own hands, and with his own public disgrace. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#013">Esther 6:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">est 6:13</a></font></span></p>Wise men - The magicians, whom after the Persian manner he had called together to consult upon this strange emergency. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#014">Esther 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">est 6:14</a></font></span></p>To bring - Who was now slack to go thither, by reason of the great dejection of his own mind.
