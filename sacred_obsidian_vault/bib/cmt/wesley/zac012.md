 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">zac 12:2</a></font></span></p>Jerusalem - That weak, unwalled city, and much more the church which is the antitype of Jerusalem. In the siege - Now when all this is in readiness, and no visible means of escape, then will God make them drink the wine of astonishment. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003">Zechariah 12:3</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">zac 12:4</a></font></span></p>I will open mine eyes - I will watch over my people for good. This eye of God open upon his people, is his wise, powerful, gracious providence for them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 12:5</a></font></span></p>The inhabitants of Jerusalem - Though but few, and poor, yet they shall be my strength. Not in their own power, but in the power of the Almighty Lord of all. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006">Zechariah 12:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 12:6</a></font></span></p>Like a hearth - A hearth on which fire is thoroughly kindled. In her own place - Not built as Nineveh, Babylon, or Rome, in some place near old cities, but in the very same place where old Jerusalem stood.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 12:7</a></font></span></p>The tents - The unfenced places, the open country, the cottages, or tents.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 12:8</a></font></span></p>As David - A mighty man of valour. The house of David - Those of the royal line shall be for prudence, and prowess in the conduct of the armies of Israel, most excellent; exprest here in an hyperbole. As the angel - Nay, like the angel of the Lord, like Christ who is captain of our salvation.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zac 12:9</a></font></span></p>I will seek - I will purposely and effectually do it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010">Zechariah 12:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zac 12:10</a></font></span></p>I will pour - This was fulfilled on Christ's exaltation, when he sent the Comforter to his disciples, it is daily performed to the children of God, and will be continually, 'till we are brought to be with Christ for ever. The house of David - The whole family of Christ, his house who was the seed of David, and who is called David, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024">Eze 37:24</a>. The spirit of grace - Which is fountain of all graces in us. Pierced - Every one of us by our sins pierced him, and many of the Jews literally. Mourn - They shall literally lament the crucifying of the Lord Jesus. In bitterness - True repentance will bitterly lament the sins which brought sorrows and shame upon our Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011">Zechariah 12:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">zac 12:11</a></font></span></p>In that day - When the Jews shall mourn for their sins, and for that great sin, crucifying the Lord of glory.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">zac 12:13</a></font></span></p>The house of Levi - The sacerdotal tribe were the most bitter persecutors of Christ, they hired the traitor, they sought witness; the high priest, (head of that family) condemned him to die, for all which they shall one day reckon with God, and therefore above other tribes they are particularly named as chief mourners for their cruelty to Christ.
