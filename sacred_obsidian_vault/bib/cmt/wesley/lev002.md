 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001">Leviticus Chapter 2</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001">Leviticus 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">lev 2:1</a></font></span></p>A meal - offering - (Not meat - offering, an ancient false print, which has run thro' many editions of our bible.) This was of two kinds, the one joined with other offerings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004">Num 15:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#007">Num 15:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#010">Num 15:10</a>, which was prescribed, together with the measure or proportion of it: the other, of which this place speaks, was left to the offerer's good will both for the thing, and for the quantity. And the matter for this offering was things without life, as meal, corn, or cakes. Now this sort of sacrifices were appointed, because these are things of greatest necessity and benefit to man, and therefore it is meet that God should be served with them, and owned and praised as the giver of them. In condescension to the poor, that they might not want an offering for God, and to shew that God would accept even the meanest services, when offered with a sincere mind. These were necessary provisions for the feast which was to be presented to God, and for the use of the priests, who were to attend upon these holy ministrations. He shall pour oil - This may note the graces of the Holy Ghost, which are compared to oil, and anointing with it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007">Psa 45:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020">Jo1 2:20</a>, and which are necessary to make any offering acceptable to God. Frankincense - Manifestly designed Christ's satisfaction and intercession, which is compared to a sweet odour, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002">Leviticus 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">lev 2:2</a></font></span></p>He shall take - That priest to whom he brought it, and who is appointed to offer it. The memorial - That part thus selected and offered; which is called a memorial, either to the offerer, who by offering this part is minded, that the whole of that he brought, and of all which he hath of that kind, is God's to whom this part was paid as an acknowledgment. Or to God, whom (to speak after the manner of men) this did put in mind of his gracious covenant and promises of favour, and acceptance of the offerer and his offering. A sweet savour unto the Lord - And so are our spiritual offerings, which are made by the fire of holy love, particularly that of almsgiving. With such sacrifices God is well - pleased. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003">Leviticus 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">lev 2:3</a></font></span></p>Sons - To be eaten by them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016">Lev 6:16</a>. Most holy - Or such as were to be eaten only by the priests, and that only in the holy place near the altar. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004">Leviticus 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">lev 2:4</a></font></span></p>In the oven - Made in the sanctuary for that use. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#006">Leviticus 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">lev 2:6</a></font></span></p>In pieces - Because part of it was offered to God, and part given to the priests. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011">Leviticus 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">lev 2:11</a></font></span></p>No leaven - Namely, in that which is offered of free - will; for in other offerings it might be used, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013">Lev 7:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017">Lev 23:17</a>. This was forbidden, partly to mind them of their deliverance out of Egypt, when they were forced thro' haste to bring away their meal or dough (which was the matter of this oblation) unleavened; partly to signify what Christ would be, and what they should be, pure and free from all error in the faith and worship of God, and from all hypocrisy, and malice or wickedness, all which are signified by leaven. Nor any honey - Either, because it hath the same effect with leaven in paste or dough, making it sour, and swelling. Or, in opposition to the sacrifices of the Gentiles, in which the use of honey was most frequent. Or, to teach us, that God's worship is not to be governed by men's fancies and appetites but by God's will. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012">Leviticus 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">lev 2:12</a></font></span></p>Ye may offer them - Or either of them, leaven or honey. They shall not be burnt - But reserved for the priests. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013">Leviticus 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">lev 2:13</a></font></span></p>Salt - To signify that incorruption of mind, and sincerity of grace, which in scripture is signified by salt, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049">Mar 9:49</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006">Col 4:6</a>, and which is necessary in all them that would offer an acceptable offering to God. Or in testimony of that communion which they had with God in these exercises of worship; salt being the great symbol of friendship in all nations is called, either, because it represented the perpetuity of God's covenant with them, which is designed by salt, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019">Num 18:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005">Ch2 13:5</a>. Or, because it was so particularly required as a condition of their covenant with God; this being made absolutely necessary in all their offerings; and as the neglect of sacrifices was a breach of covenant on their part, so also was the neglect of salt in their sacrifices. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014">Leviticus 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">lev 2:14</a></font></span></p>First - fruits - Of thine own free - will; for there were other first - fruits, and that of several sorts, which were prescribed, and the time, quality, and proportion of them appointed by God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#016">Leviticus 2:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">lev 2:16</a></font></span></p>Made by fire - The fire denotes that fervency of spirit, which ought to be in all our religious services. Holy love is the fire, by which all our offerings must be made: else they are not of a sweet savour to God.
