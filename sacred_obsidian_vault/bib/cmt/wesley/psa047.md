 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 47</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003">Psalms 47:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 47:3</a></font></span></p>Subdue - He speaks this in the name of the whole church, to which all particular believers were to submit themselves in the Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004">Psalms 47:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 47:4</a></font></span></p>Chuse - He will appoint and bestow upon us. Inheritance - The presence and worship, and blessing of God. This God had chosen for the Israelites and resolved to chuse or set apart for the Gentiles. Of Jacob - Of the people of Jacob or Israel, who are frequently called Jacob, for these did actually enjoy the presence of God in his sanctuary. Loved - Not for any peculiar worth in them, but for his free love to them, as he declareth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007">Deu 7:7-8</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005">Psalms 47:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 47:5</a></font></span></p>God - This is meant literally of the ark: but mystically of Christ's ascension into heaven, as may be gathered by comparing this with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008">Eph 4:8</a>, where the like words uttered concerning the ark upon the same occasion, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psa 68:18</a>, are directly applied to Christ's ascension. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007">Psalms 47:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 47:7</a></font></span></p>The king - Not only ours, but of all the nations of the world. Sing - Not formally and carelessly, but seriously, considering the greatness of this king whom you praise, and what abundant cause you have to praise him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008">Psalms 47:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 47:8</a></font></span></p>The throne - Heaven is often called God's throne, whence God is said to behold and to rule all nations; of which general dominion of God, he here speaks. And Christ sits at his father's right - hand, for that purpose. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009">Psalms 47:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 47:9</a></font></span></p>The princes - The Gentiles, who were divided in their principles, and interests, and religions, are now united and gathered together to Christ, laying their scepters at his feet, and jointly owning his worship and service. And altho' he mentions their conversion only, yet the conversion of their people might reasonably be supposed. Of the God - He doth not say the people of Abraham, lest this should be appropriated to the Israelites; but the people of the God of Abraham who worship the God of Abraham, whether they be Jews or Gentiles. The Shields - The princes or rulers, who are called shields, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018">Hos 4:18</a>, because by their office they are the common prosecutors of all their people. These are the Lord's, at his disposal, or subject to his dominion, both as to their hearts and kingdoms. Exalted - By this means God shall be greatly glorified.
