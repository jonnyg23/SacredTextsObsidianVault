 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezra 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ezr 5:1</a></font></span></p>The son - His grand - child; for he was the son of Baraciah. Prophesied - Commanding them from God to return to building the temple, with a promise of his favour and assistance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002">Ezra 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ezr 5:2</a></font></span></p>Helping - Encouraging the people to work by their presence, and assurance of success. It is supposed, the work had stopt about fifteen years. The first chapter of Haggai is the best comment on these two verses. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003">Ezra 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ezr 5:3</a></font></span></p>Shethar - boznai - Not Rehum and Shimshai, &amp;c. who were either dead, or removed from their office by Darius.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ezr 5:4</a></font></span></p>We - Jews. Accordingly - According to what they asked. That made this building - That were the undertakers and encouragers of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008">Ezra 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ezr 5:8</a></font></span></p>Great God - And indeed, thus far the greater part of the Samaritans agreed with them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017">Ezra 5:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ezr 5:17</a></font></span></p>Now therefore. &amp;c. - If the case had been so fairly stated to Artaxerxes, he would hardly have hindered the work. The people of God could not be persecuted, if they were not belied.
