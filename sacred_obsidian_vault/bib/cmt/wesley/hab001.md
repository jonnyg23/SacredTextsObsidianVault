The law - The whole law, moral, ceremonial, and judicial. Is slacked - Is slighted, and not observed. Go forth - From magistrates, judges, and public officers. Doth compass about - As it were besieges, with design to oppress and ruin. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005">Habakkuk 1:5</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">hab 1:6</a></font></span></p>Bitter - Cruel, and without mercy. Hasty - Speedy in executing their merciless purposes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007">Habakkuk 1:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">hab 1:7</a></font></span></p>Their judgment - The law they observe, is their own will. Their dignity - Their authority is all from themselves, without respect to any other law or rule whatever. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008">Habakkuk 1:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">hab 1:8</a></font></span></p>The evening wolves - Which with fasting in the day, came out in the evening, fierce and ravenous. Shall spread - All over the land. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009">Habakkuk 1:9</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012">Habakkuk 1:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">hab 1:12</a></font></span></p>Shall not die - Be utterly destroyed. Ordained - Set up, and designed. Them - The Chaldean kingdom. For judgment - To execute this judgment, which is tempered with mercy. For correction - To chastise, not to destroy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014">Habakkuk 1:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">hab 1:14</a></font></span></p>And makest - Not infusing cruel appetites, but permitting them to act according to such appetite which was already in them. As the fishes - Of which the greater greedily devour the smaller. Creeping things - Which in the waters are food for the lesser fry; so the world, like the sea, is wholly oppression. No ruler - None to defend the weak, or restrain the mighty. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015">Habakkuk 1:15</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">hab 1:17</a></font></span></p>Empty their net - As fisher - men empty the full net to fill it again.
