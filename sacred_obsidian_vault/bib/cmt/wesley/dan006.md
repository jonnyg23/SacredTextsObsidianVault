 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001">Daniel Chapter 6</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#002">Daniel 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">dan 6:2</a></font></span></p>Daniel was first - Belshazzar's promise to Daniel was, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007">Dan 5:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#016">Dan 5:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029">Dan 5:29</a>. The first was general of the army, the second president of the palace, the third of the land and provinces. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#004">Daniel 6:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">dan 6:4</a></font></span></p>Concerning the kingdom - And so to have made him guilty of treason, or other high misdemeanors, in the king's business. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010">Daniel 6:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">dan 6:10</a></font></span></p>Toward Jerusalem - The temple was the place where the Lord placed his name, and promised to appear, and accept his people, all being a type of Christ, through whom only sinners are accepted. As he did aforetime - He did not abate his prayers for the king's command, nor did he break the law purposely, because he did no more than he was wont to do in serving his God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#014">Daniel 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">dan 6:14</a></font></span></p>Displeased with himself - For having made that foolish decree. To deliver him - To find out some way of delivering him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#020">Daniel 6:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">dan 6:20</a></font></span></p>Able to deliver - What he doubted of, we are sure of, that the servants of the living God, have a master who is able to deliver them and bear them out in his service. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022">Daniel 6:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">dan 6:22</a></font></span></p>His angel - The same that was with the three children in the fiery furnace, whose presence made even the lion's den a strong - hold, his palace, his paradise. See the power of God over the fiercest creatures! See the care God takes of his faithful servants, especially when they are called to suffer for him! See how ready the angels are to minister to the heirs of salvation! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#025">Daniel 6:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">dan 6:25</a></font></span></p>In all the earth - In all that great empire. It is usual with the Turk, Tartar, Chinese, to arrogate the same universality.
