 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001">2 Corinthians Chapter 13</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001">2 Corinthians 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co2 13:1</a></font></span></p>I am coming this third time - He had been coming twice before, though he did not actually come. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002">2 Corinthians 13:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co2 13:2</a></font></span></p>All the rest - Who have since then sinned in any of these kinds. I will not spare - I will severely punish them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004">2 Corinthians 13:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co2 13:4</a></font></span></p>He was crucified through weakness - Through the impotence of human nature. We also are weak with him - We appear weak and despicable by partaking of the same sufferings for his sake. But we shall live with him - Being raised from the dead. By the power of God in you - By that divine energy which is now in every believer, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005">Co2 13:5</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005">2 Corinthians 13:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co2 13:5</a></font></span></p>Prove yourselves - Whether ye are such as can, or such as cannot, bear the test - This is the proper meaning of the word which we translate, reprobates. Know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you - All Christian believers know this, by the witness and by the fruit of his Spirit. Some translate the words, Jesus Christ is among you; that is, in the church of Corinth; and understand them of the miraculous gifts and the power of Christ which attended the censures of the apostle. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006">2 Corinthians 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co2 13:6</a></font></span></p>And I trust ye shall know - By proving yourselves, not by putting my authority to the proof. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007">2 Corinthians 13:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co2 13:7</a></font></span></p>I pray God that ye may do no evil - To give me occasion of showing my apostolical power. I do not desire to appear approved - By miraculously punishing you. But that ye may do that which is good, though we should be as reprobates - Having no occasion to give that proof of our apostleship. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#008">2 Corinthians 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co2 13:8</a></font></span></p>For we can do nothing against the truth - Neither against that which is just and right, nor against those who walk according to the truth of the gospel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009">2 Corinthians 13:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co2 13:9</a></font></span></p>For we rejoice when we are weak - When we appear so, having no occasion to show our apostolic power. And this we wish, even your perfection - In the faith that worketh by love. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011">2 Corinthians 13:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co2 13:11</a></font></span></p>Be perfect - Aspire to the highest degree of holiness. Be of good comfort - Filled with divine consolation. Be of one mind - Desire, labour, pray for it, to the utmost degree that is possible. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#013">2 Corinthians 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">co2 13:13</a></font></span></p>The grace - Or favour. Of our Lord Jesus Christ - By which alone we can come to the Father. And the love of God - Manifested to you, and abiding in you. And the communion - Or fellowship. Of the Holy Ghost - In all his gifts and graces.
 <p>
 </p><p>It is with great reason that this comprehensive and instructive blessing is pronounced at the close of our solemn assemblies; and it is a very indecent thing to see so many quitting them, or getting into postures of remove, before this short sentence can be ended.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>How often have we heard this awful benediction pronounced! Let us study it more and more, that we may value it proportionably; that we may either deliver or receive it with a becoming reverence, with eyes and hearts lifted up to God, "who giveth the blessing out of Sion, and life for evermore."
