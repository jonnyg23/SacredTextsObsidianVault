 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001">Matthew 22:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mat 22:1</a></font></span></p>Jesus answering, spake - That is, spake with reference to what had just past. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002">Matthew 22:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mat 22:2</a></font></span></p>A king, who made a marriage feast for his son - So did God, when he brought his first - begotten into the world. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003">Matthew 22:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mat 22:3</a></font></span></p>Them that were invited - Namely, the Jews. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004">Matthew 22:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mat 22:4</a></font></span></p>Fatlings - Fatted beasts and fowls. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005">Matthew 22:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mat 22:5</a></font></span></p>One to his farm, another to his merchandise - One must mind what he has; another, gain what he wants. How many perish by misusing lawful things! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007">Matthew 22:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mat 22:7</a></font></span></p>The king sending forth his troops - The Roman armies employed of God for that purpose. Destroyed those murderers - Primarily the Jews. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#008">Matthew 22:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mat 22:8</a></font></span></p>Go into the highways - The word properly signifies, the by - ways, or turnings of the road. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010">Matthew 22:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mat 22:10</a></font></span></p>They gathered all - By preaching every where. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011">Matthew 22:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mat 22:11</a></font></span></p>The guest - The members of the visible Church. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012">Matthew 22:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mat 22:12</a></font></span></p>A wedding garment - The righteousness of Christ, first imputed, then implanted. It may easily be observed, this has no relation to the Lord's Supper, but to God's proceeding at the last day. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014">Matthew 22:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mat 22:14</a></font></span></p>Many are called; few chosen - Many hear; few believe. Yea, many are members of the visible, but few of the invisible Church. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016">Mat 20:16</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015">Matthew 22:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">mat 22:15</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013">Mar 12:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020">Luk 20:20</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016">Matthew 22:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">mat 22:16</a></font></span></p>The Herodians were a set of men peculiarly attached to Herod, and consequently zealous for the interest of the Roman government, which was the main support of the dignity and royalty of his family. Thou regardest not the person of men - Thou favourest no man for his riches or greatness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017">Matthew 22:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">mat 22:17</a></font></span></p>Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar? - If he had said, Yes, the Pharisees would have accused him to the people, as a betrayer of the liberties of his country. If he had said, No, the Herodians would have accused him to the Roman governor. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018">Matthew 22:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">mat 22:18</a></font></span></p>Ye hypocrites - Pretending a scruple of conscience. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#020">Matthew 22:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mat 22:20</a></font></span></p>The tribute money - A Roman coin, stamped with the head of Cesar, which was usually paid in tribute. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021">Matthew 22:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mat 22:21</a></font></span></p>They say to him, Cesar's - Plainly acknowledging, by their having received his coin, that they were under his government. And indeed this is a standing rule. The current coin of every nation shows who is the supreme governor of it. Render therefore, ye Pharisees, to Cesar the things which ye yourselves acknowledge to be Cesar's: and, ye Herodians, while ye are zealous for Cesar, see that ye render to God the things that are God's. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023">Matthew 22:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">mat 22:23</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018">Mar 12:18</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024">Matthew 22:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mat 22:24</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005">Deu 25:5</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#025">Matthew 22:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mat 22:25</a></font></span></p>Now there were with us seven brethren - This story seems to have been a kind of common - place objection, which no doubt they brought upon all occasions. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029">Matthew 22:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">mat 22:29</a></font></span></p>Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures - Which plainly assert a resurrection. Nor the power of God - Which is well able to effect it. How many errors flow from the same source? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030">Matthew 22:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">mat 22:30</a></font></span></p>They are as the angels - Incorruptible and immortal. So is the power of God shown in them! So little need had they of marriage! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#031">Matthew 22:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">mat 22:31</a></font></span></p>Have ye not read - The Sadducees had a peculiar value for the books of Moses. Out of these therefore our Lord argues with them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032">Matthew 22:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">mat 22:32</a></font></span></p>I am the God of Abraham - The argument runs thus: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living: (for that expression, Thy God, implies both benefit from God to man, and duty from man to God) but he is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: therefore, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not dead, but living. Therefore, the soul does not die with the body. So indeed the Sadducees supposed, and it was on this ground that they denied the resurrection. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006">Exo 3:6</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#033">Matthew 22:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">mat 22:33</a></font></span></p>At his doctrine - At the clearness and solidity of his answers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034">Matthew 22:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">mat 22:34</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028">Mar 12:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025">Luk 10:25</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035">Matthew 22:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">mat 22:35</a></font></span></p>A scribe asking him a question, trying him - Not, as it seems, with any ill design: but barely to make a farther trial of that wisdom, which he had shown in silencing the Sadducees. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037">Matthew 22:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">mat 22:37</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005">Deu 6:5</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039">Matthew 22:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">mat 22:39</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018">Lev 19:18</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042">Matthew 22:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">mat 22:42</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041">Luk 20:41</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043">Matthew 22:43</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_043">mat 22:43</a></font></span></p>How doth David then by the Spirit - By inspiration, call him Lord? If he be merely the son (or descendant) of David? If he be, as you suppose, a mere man, the son of a man? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044">Matthew 22:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">mat 22:44</a></font></span></p>The Lord said to my Lord - This his dominion, to which David himself was subject, shows both the heavenly majesty of the king, and the nature of his kingdom. Sit thou on my right hand - That is, remain in the highest authority and power. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001">Psa 110:1</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#046">Matthew 22:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">mat 22:46</a></font></span></p>Neither durst any question him any more - Not by way of ensnaring or tempting him.
