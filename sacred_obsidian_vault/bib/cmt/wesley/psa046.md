 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002">Psalms 46:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 46:2</a></font></span></p>Though - Though there should be nothing but confusion, and desolations round about us: which are often expressed by such metaphors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004">Psalms 46:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 46:4</a></font></span></p>A river - This may design the gracious presence, and blessing of the Lord, which is frequently described under the name of waters. Make glad - Shall not barely preserve it from danger, but give great occasion for rejoicing and thanksgiving. The city - Jerusalem, the place where God's holy tabernacle is settled. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007">Psalms 46:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 46:7</a></font></span></p>Raged - Against God, and against his people. Uttered - He spake to them in his wrath. The earth - The inhabitants of the earth were consumed.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 46:9</a></font></span></p>To cease - He hath settled as in a firm and well - grounded peace. The land - Of Israel: from one end of it to the other. The bow - The bows and spears, and chariots of their enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011">Psalms 46:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 46:11</a></font></span></p>Be still - Stir no more against my people. God - The only true and almighty God; your gods are but dumb and impotent idols. Exalted - I will make myself glorious by my great and wonderful works.
