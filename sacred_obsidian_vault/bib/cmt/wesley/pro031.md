 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001">Proverbs Chapter 31</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001">Proverbs 31:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pro 31:1</a></font></span></p>Lemuel - Of Solomon, by the general consent both of Jewish and Christian writers; this name signifies one from God, or belonging to God, and such an one was Solomon eminently, being given by God to David and Bathsheba, as a pledge of his reconciliation to them after their repentance. Possibly his mother gave him this name to mind him of his great obligations to God, and of the justice of his devoting himself to God's service. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#002">Proverbs 31:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pro 31:2</a></font></span></p>What - A short speech, arguing her great passion for him; what words shall I take? What counsels shall I give thee? My heart is full, but where shall I begin? Of my womb - My son, not by adoption, but whom I bare in the womb, and therefore it is my duty to give thee admonitions, and thine to receive them. My vows - On whose behalf I have made many prayers and sacrifices, and solemn vows to God; whom I have, as far as in me lay, devoted to the work, and service, and glory of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#003">Proverbs 31:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pro 31:3</a></font></span></p>Strength - The vigour of thy mind and body. Ways - Thy conversation, repeated in other words.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">pro 31:4</a></font></span></p>To drink - To excess. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006">Proverbs 31:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">pro 31:6</a></font></span></p>To perish - To faint; for such need a cordial.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013">Proverbs 31:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pro 31:13</a></font></span></p>Flax - That she may find employment for her servants. Worketh - She encourages them to work by her example; which was a common practice among princesses in those first ages.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#021">Proverbs 31:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pro 31:21</a></font></span></p>Not afraid - Of any injuries of the weather. Are clothed - She hath provided enough, not only for their necessity, but also for their delight and ornament.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">pro 31:26</a></font></span></p>Openeth her mouth - She is neither sullenly silent, nor full of impertinent talk, but speaks discreetly and piously, as occasion offers.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">pro 31:30</a></font></span></p>Favour - Comeliness, which commonly gives women favour with those who behold them. Deceitful - It gives a false representation of the person, being often a cover to a deformed soul; it does not give a man that satisfaction, which at first he promised to himself from it; and it is soon lost, not only by death, but by many diseases and contingencies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#031">Proverbs 31:31</a></p>
