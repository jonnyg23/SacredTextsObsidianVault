 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001">Ezekiel Chapter 28</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002">Ezekiel 28:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eze 28:2</a></font></span></p>Hast said - In thy heart. In the seat of God - Safe and impregnable as heaven itself. A man - Subject to casualties, sorrows, and distresses. Set thine heart - Thou hast entertained thoughts, which become none but God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003">Ezekiel 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 28:3</a></font></span></p>Wiser - In thy own thoughts. Daniel - Who was then famous for his wisdom. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007">Ezekiel 28:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 28:7</a></font></span></p>The beauty - Those beautiful things, in which thy wisdom appeared. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010">Ezekiel 28:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 28:10</a></font></span></p>The deaths - Temporal and eternal. Of the uncircumcised - Of the wicked, an accursed death. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012">Ezekiel 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">eze 28:12</a></font></span></p>Thou sealest up - Thou fanciest that fulness of wisdom, and perfection of beauty are in thee. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013">Ezekiel 28:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">eze 28:13</a></font></span></p>In Eden - In the midst of all delights. The workmanship - Now the prophet notes their joys, musick, and songs, both to loud, and to softer musick, as the lute, and tabret in the day of their kings coronation, and all this on instruments of most exquisite make, and of their own artists work; in this they exceeded as in the other. Created - King: in the day of thy coronation. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014">Ezekiel 28:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eze 28:14</a></font></span></p>Cherub - For thy wisdom, power, and excellency, like a cherub, or angel; for the sacredness of thy person, and office, as the anointed of God; for the exercise of thy power, as a shield, as a protector of the weak. And I - I, whom thou forgetest have made thee so. Thou wast - Thou wast advanced to kingly dignity, (which David calls a mountain, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007">Psa 30:7</a>,) a sacred office, and of divine institution. In the midst - Surrounded with stones, that sparkle like fire. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#015">Ezekiel 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">eze 28:15</a></font></span></p>Thou wast perfect - Is not this an irony? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016">Ezekiel 28:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eze 28:16</a></font></span></p>I will cast - Out thy kingly dignity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017">Ezekiel 28:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">eze 28:17</a></font></span></p>Corrupted - Depraved, or lost thy wisdom. Behold thee - That thou mayst be a spectacle, and warning to them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#018">Ezekiel 28:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">eze 28:18</a></font></span></p>I will bring thee - Thou shalt be burnt to ashes, and trampled under feet. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#019">Ezekiel 28:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">eze 28:19</a></font></span></p>All - All that have formerly known thy riches, power, allies, and wisdom. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022">Ezekiel 28:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">eze 28:22</a></font></span></p>Zidon - A city, north - west from Canaan, a king's seat of old, and from which Tyre descended. I will be glorified - When my judgments make my justice, power and truth appear, both you, and others shall confess my glory. Sanctified - Owned as holy, reverenced as just, obeyed as sovereign. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#023">Ezekiel 28:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">eze 28:23</a></font></span></p>And blood - Bloody war by an enemy, that shall bring the war to the gates, nay into the streets of Zidon. Judged - Be punished in the midst of the city. The sword - By the sword of her enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024">Ezekiel 28:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">eze 28:24</a></font></span></p>A pricking briar - By these two metaphors the prophet points out the troublesome neighbours of the Jews, such as Moab, Ammon, Edom, Tyre, and Zidon. This never had a full accomplishment yet. But it will, for the scripture cannot be broken. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025">Ezekiel 28:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">eze 28:25</a></font></span></p>Sanctified - I was dishonoured by the Jews in the sight of the heathen, and I will be honoured by the Jews in their sight.
