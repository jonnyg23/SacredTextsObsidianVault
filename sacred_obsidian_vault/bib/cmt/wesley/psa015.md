 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 15</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001">Psalms 15:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 15:1</a></font></span></p>Who - Who shall so dwell in thy church here, as to dwell with thee for ever in heaven? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002">Psalms 15:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 15:2</a></font></span></p>Uprightly - Loving, and serving God, and loving his neighbour not in word only, but in truth; and this constantly. Worketh - Makes it his business to do justly, to give to every one his due, first to God, and then to men. Speaketh - His words and professions to God and men, agree with the thoughts and purposes of his heart. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003">Psalms 15:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 15:3</a></font></span></p>He - He that doth not speak evil of his neighbour. Neighbour - That is, any man. Nor taketh - Into his mouth, doth not raise it, neither spread or propagate it; or believe it without sufficient reason. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004">Psalms 15:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 15:4</a></font></span></p>Vile - An ungodly man. Honoureth - He highly esteems and loves them, though they be mean as to their worldly condition, and though they may differ from him in some opinions or practices of lesser moment. Sweareth - A promissory oath. Hurt - To his own damage. As if a man solemnly swear, that he will sell him such an estate at a price below the full worth; or that, he will give a poor man such a sum of money, which afterwards he finds inconvenient to him. Changeth not - His purpose, but continues firm and resolved to perform his promise. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005">Psalms 15:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 15:5</a></font></span></p>To usury - In such a manner as is contrary to God's law: of which see otherwise, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025">Exo 22:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036">Lev 25:36-37</a>, &amp;c. Reward - Or, a bribe for him who hath a bad cause. Moved - He shall abide with God here, and when he dies be for ever with the Lord.
