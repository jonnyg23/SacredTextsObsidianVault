 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">sa1 27:1</a></font></span></p>I shall perish - But this was certainly a very great fault in David: for This proceeded from gross distrust of God's promise and providence; and that after such repeated demonstrations of God's peculiar care over him. He forsakes the place where god had settled him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005">Sa1 22:5</a>, and given him both assurance and experience of his protection there. He voluntarily runs upon that rock, which he cursed his enemies for throwing him upon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019">Sa1 26:19</a>, and upon many other snares and dangers, as the following history will shew; and withal, deprives the people of the Lord of those succours which he might have given them, in case of a battle. But God hereby designed to withdraw David from the Israelites, that they might fall by the hand of the Philistines, without any reproach or inconvenience to David. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 27:4</a></font></span></p>Sought no more for him - At their meeting Saul's heart was deeply wounded, and he had said, "Return, my son David, Be with me as in time past." Nor have we the least proof, that he would have sought for him again, with any other design. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">sa1 27:5</a></font></span></p>Give me a place - A prudent desire. Hereby David designed to preserve his people, both from the vices, which conversation with the Philistines would have exposed them to; and from that envy, and malice, which diversity of religion might have caused. With thee - Which is too great an honour for me, and too burdensome to thee, and may be an occasion of offence to thy people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 27:6</a></font></span></p>Gave Ziklag - Not only to inhabit, but to possess it as his own. Which he did, to lay the greater obligations upon David, whom he knew so able to serve him. It was given to the tribe of Judah before, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031">Jos 15:31</a>, but the Philistines kept the possession of it 'till this time. And being given by them to David, it now belonged not to the tribe of Judah; but to the king of Judah, David and his heirs forever. To this day - This, and some such clauses seem to have been added, after the main substance of the several books was written. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 27:8</a></font></span></p>Amalekites - The remnant of those whom Saul destroyed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003">Sa1 15:3-9</a>, who retired into remote and desert places. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 27:9</a></font></span></p>Let neither man, &amp;c. - In that part where he came: but there were more of the Amalekites yet left in another part of that land. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">sa1 27:10</a></font></span></p>David - These and the following words are ambiguous, and contrary to that simplicity which became David, both as a prince, and as an eminent professor of the true religion. The fidelity of Achish to him, and the confidence he put in him, aggravates his sin in thus deceiving him, which David seems penitently to reflect on, when he prays, Remove from me the way of lying.
