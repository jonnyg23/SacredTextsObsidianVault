The forest - More fully called the house of the forest of Lebanon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002">Kg1 7:2</a>, not because it was built in Lebanon, for it was in Jerusalem; but because it was built of the trees of Lebanon. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009">Isaiah 22:9</a></p>

For the Jews say, he was a stranger by birth; which is the more probable, because his pedigree is not mentioned in any of those places of scripture where he is named. On high - In an high and eminent place. An habitation - He erected a stately house to live in, and a stately sepulchre to receive him when he died. And these two are fitly joined together, because their sepulchres were commonly built in or near their houses. A rock - A fit place both for strength and state.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 22:19</a></font></span></p>He - The Lord; such sudden changes of persons being very usual in these writings. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020">Isaiah 22:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 22:20</a></font></span></p>Call - By my powerful providence.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 22:21</a></font></span></p>Girdle - There was a peculiar sort of robe and girdle which was the badge of his office. A father - He shall govern them with fatherly care and affection.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">isa 22:23</a></font></span></p>Fasten - I will establish the power in his hands. Sure place - In the strong walls, or solid timber, in the house. He shall be - By his prudent and righteous government he shall procure great glory, to all that have any relation to him. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024">Isaiah 22:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 22:24</a></font></span></p>The glory - Of his own kindred and family, who shall all depend upon him, and receive glory from him; of the house of David, which is called his father's house, because he was of the blood - royal. The offspring - Great and small, the children and grand - children of his father's house, the meanest of them shall receive a lustre from their relation to him. All vessels - All sorts of vessels, great or small, mean or precious, may be hanged upon him, without any fear of falling.
