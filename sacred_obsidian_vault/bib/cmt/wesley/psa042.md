 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001">Psalms 42:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 42:1</a></font></span></p>Panteth - After the enjoyment of thee in thy sanctuary. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002">Psalms 42:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 42:2</a></font></span></p>Thirsteth - Not after vain useless idols, but after the only true and living God. Appear - In the place of his special presence and publick worship. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004">Psalms 42:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 42:4</a></font></span></p>Remember - My banishment from God's presence, and mine enemies triumphs. In me - I breathe out my sorrows and complaints to God within my own breast. The multitudes - Israelites, who went thither in great numbers. Holy - day - Or that kept the feast, the three solemn festival solemnities, which they kept holy unto the Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005">Psalms 42:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 42:5</a></font></span></p>For - Heb. for the salvations of his face, for those supports, deliverances and comforts which I doubt not I shall enjoy both in his presence and sanctuary, and from his presence, and the light of his countenance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006">Psalms 42:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 42:6</a></font></span></p>Therefore - Therefore that I may revive my drooping spirits. Remember - I will consider thy infinite mercy and power, and faithfulness. Mizar - From all the parts of the land, to which I shall be driven; whether from the parts beyond Jordan on the east: or mount Hermon, which was in the northern parts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007">Psalms 42:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 42:7</a></font></span></p>Deep - One affliction comes immediately after another, as if it were called for by the former. A metaphor taken from violent and successive showers of rain; which frequently come down from heaven, as it were at the noise, or call of God's water spouts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008">Psalms 42:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 42:8</a></font></span></p>Command - Will effectually confer upon me. Loving - kindness - His blessings, the effects of his loving - kindness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010">Psalms 42:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 42:10</a></font></span></p>As - As a sword, which cutteth the very bones, so painful are their reproaches.
