 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001">Acts Chapter 11</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#004">Acts 11:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">act 11:4</a></font></span></p>Peter laid all things before them - So he did not take it ill to be questioned, nor desire to be treated as infallible. And he answers the more mildly because it related to a point which he had not readily believed himself. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005">Acts 11:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 11:5</a></font></span></p>Being in a trance - Which suspends the use of the outward senses. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#014">Acts 11:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">act 11:14</a></font></span></p>Saved - With the full Christian salvation, in this world and the world to come. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017">Acts 11:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">act 11:17</a></font></span></p>To us, when we believed - The sense is, because we believed, not because we were circumcised, was the Holy Ghost given to us. What was I - A mere instrument in God's hand. They had inquired only concerning his eating with the Gentiles. He satisfies them likewise concerning his baptizing them, and shows that he had done right in going to Cornelius, not only by the command of God, but also by the event, the descent of the Holy Ghost. And who are we that we should withstand God? Particularly by laying down rules of Christian communion which exclude any whom he has admitted into the Church of the first born, from worshipping God together. O that all Church governors would consider how bold an usurpation this is on the authority of the supreme Lord of the Church! O that the sin of thus withstanding God may not be laid to the charge of those, who perhaps with a good intention, but in an over fondness for their own forms, have done it, and are continually doing it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018">Acts 11:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 11:18</a></font></span></p>They glorified God - Being thoroughly satisfied. Repentance unto life - True repentance is a change from spiritual death to spiritual life, and leads to life everlasting. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019">Acts 11:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">act 11:19</a></font></span></p>They who had been dispersed - St. Luke here resumes the thread of his narration, in the very words wherewith he broke it off, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#006">Act 8:6</a>. As far as Phenicia to the north, Cyprus to the west, and Antioch to the east. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020">Acts 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">act 11:20</a></font></span></p>Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene - Who were more accustomed to converse with the Gentiles. Who coming into Antioch - Then the capital of Syria, and, next to Rome and Alexandria, the most considerable city of the empire. Spake to the Greeks - As the Greeks were the most celebrated of the Gentile nations near Judea, the Jews called all the Gentiles by that name. Here we have the first account of the preaching the Gospel to the idolatrous Gentiles. All those to whom it had been preached before, did at least worship one God, the God of Israel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#021">Acts 11:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">act 11:21</a></font></span></p>And the hand of the Lord - That is, the power of his Spirit. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026">Acts 11:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">act 11:26</a></font></span></p>And the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch - Here it was that they first received this standing appellation. They were before termed Nazarenes and Galileans. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Acts 11:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">act 11:28</a></font></span></p>Agabus rising up - In the congregation. All the world - The word frequently signifies all the Roman empire. And so it is doubtless to be taken here. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029">Acts 11:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">act 11:29</a></font></span></p>Then - Understanding the distress they would otherwise be in on that account, the disciples determined to send relief to the brethren in Judea - Who herein received a manifest proof of the reality of their conversion. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030">Acts 11:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">act 11:30</a></font></span></p>Sending it to the elders - Who gave it to the deacons, to be distributed by them, as every one had need.
