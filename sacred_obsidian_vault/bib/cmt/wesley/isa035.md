 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001">Isaiah 35:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 35:1</a></font></span></p>The solitary place - Emmanuel's land, or the seat of God's church and people, which formerly was despised like a wilderness, and which the rage of their enemies had brought to desolation, shall flourish exceedingly. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002">Isaiah 35:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 35:2</a></font></span></p>The excellency - The wilderness shall be as pleasant and fruitful as Lebanon, and Carmel, and Sharon. They - The inhabitants of the wilderness aforesaid. The glory - The glorious discoveries of God's power and goodness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003">Isaiah 35:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 35:3</a></font></span></p>Strengthen - Ye ministers of God, comfort and encourage God's people, who are now ready to faint. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004">Isaiah 35:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 35:4</a></font></span></p>Your God - Tho' he seems to be departed, he will come to you, and abide with you. He will shortly come in the flesh, to execute vengeance upon the enemies of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005">Isaiah 35:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 35:5</a></font></span></p>Then - The poor Gentiles, who before were blind and deaf, shall now have the eyes and ears of their minds opened to see God's works, and to hear and receive his word. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007">Isaiah 35:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 35:7</a></font></span></p>Streams - The most dry and barren places shall be made moist and fruitful; which is principally meant of the plentiful effusion of God's grace upon such persons and nations, as had been wholly destitute of it. Rushes - Those dry and parched deserts, in which dragons have their abode, shall yield abundance of grass, and reeds, and rushes, which grow only in moist ground. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008">Isaiah 35:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 35:8</a></font></span></p>A way - The high - way and the way are not to be taken for two different ways, but for one and the same way, even a causey, which is raised ground, and a way. Holiness - The people (walking in it) shall be all righteous. For those - But this way shall be appropriated to those persons above - mentioned; the weak, and blind, and lame, whom God will lead and save. Though fools - The way shall be so plain and strait, that even the most foolish travellers cannot easily mistake it.
