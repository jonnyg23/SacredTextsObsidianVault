 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002">Psalms 17:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 17:2</a></font></span></p>Sentence - Judgment on my behalf. Come - From thy tribunal.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 17:3</a></font></span></p>Proved - Or, searched or tried it, by many temptations and afflictions. Night - When mens minds being freed from the distraction of business, and from the society of men, they act more vigorously and freely, according to their several inclinations. Tried - As gold - smiths do metals. Nothing - Nothing of unrighteousness. Purposed - I have resolved, upon deliberation, as the word implies. Mouth - I am so far from practising against Saul's life, as they charge me, that I will not wrong him so much as in a word. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#004">Psalms 17:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 17:4</a></font></span></p>Concerning - Observing the works of the men of this age, how wicked they are, I was resolved to take more care in ordering my own actions. By - By the help of thy blessed word. Paths - The customs and practices. Destroyer - Or, of the violent man: such as Saul, and his courtiers and soldiers.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 17:11</a></font></span></p>Steps - In all our ways. We go from place to place, to rocks, and caves, and woods; but wheresoever we go they are at hand, and ready to surround us. Eyes - They keep their eyes fixed upon us. Bowing - Couching down upon the earth, that they may watch the fittest opportunity to surprize us. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013">Psalms 17:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 17:13</a></font></span></p>Sword - Thy instrument to execute vengeance upon thine enemies. Do not punish me with this rod: let me fall into thy hands, and not into the hands of men.

World - Who set their hearts upon this world, and neither have, nor desire any other portion. Belly - Mind or appetite, as that word is used, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#020">Job 20:20</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030">Pro 20:30</a>. Treasure - With extraordinary wealth and glory. Children - When many of thy faithful servants are barren, these are blessed with a numerous posterity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015">Psalms 17:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">psa 17:15</a></font></span></p>I will - I do not place my portion in earthly treasures, but in beholding God's face, in the enjoyment of God's presence and favour; which is enjoyed in part in this life, but not fully. Satisfied - The time is coming, wherein I shall be abundantly satisfied with beholding thy face. Awake - When I arise from he dead. Likeness - With the image of God stamped upon my glorified soul.
