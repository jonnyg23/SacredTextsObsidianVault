 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 51:6</a></font></span></p>Soul - By soul is meant life, and by iniquity the punishment of the Babylonian's iniquity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007">Jeremiah 51:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 51:7</a></font></span></p>Drunken - She had made all the nations about her drunken with the Lord's fury. Mad - Through the misery they felt from her. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009">Jeremiah 51:9</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 51:10</a></font></span></p>Some - These words are spoken in the person of the Jews, owning the destruction of Babylon to be the mighty work of God, and an act of justice, revenging the wrongs of his people.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013">Jeremiah 51:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jer 51:13</a></font></span></p>Waters - Babylon is said to dwell upon many waters, because the great river Euphrates, did not only run by it, but almost encompass it branching itself into many smaller rivers, which made several parts of the city, islands.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025">Jeremiah 51:25</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">jer 51:32</a></font></span></p>The passages - The passages over the river Euphrates, and all the other passages by which the Babylonians might make their escape, were guarded with soldiers. Reeds - On the border of the river Euphrates were vast quantities of great and tall reeds, which with the mud in which they stood, were as another wall to the city; but the Medes had burnt them so as the way was open. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033">Jeremiah 51:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">jer 51:33</a></font></span></p>Threshing floor - Babylon had been a threshing instrument, by which, and a threshing - floor in which God had threshed many other nations; God now intended to make it as a threshing - floor wherein he would thresh the Chaldeans. Tread her - So they used to prepare their threshing - floors against the time of harvest. The time - The harvest which the justice of God would have from the ruin of the Chaldeans.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">jer 51:44</a></font></span></p>Bel - Bel was the principal Babylonian idol. Bring forth - All the vessels of the temple, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007">Ch2 36:7</a>, and whatever gifts the Babylonians had presented to him.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050">Jeremiah 51:50</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_050">jer 51:50</a></font></span></p>Ye - Ye Jews, leave Babylon as soon as liberty is proclaimed. Remember - And remember in Judea the great things both of justice and mercy which God hath done.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052">Jeremiah 51:52</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_052">jer 51:52</a></font></span></p>Wherefore - For this profanation of my holy place, I will be revenged not only upon their idols, but upon the worshippers of them, and cause a groaning of wounded men over all the country of the Chaldeans.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_055">jer 51:55</a></font></span></p>The great voice - The noises caused from multitudes of people walking up and trafficking together. A noise - The noise of her enemies that shall break in upon her shall be like the roaring of the sea. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#056">Jeremiah 51:56</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_056">jer 51:56</a></font></span></p>Because - Little more is said here than was before, only the words hint the taking of Babylon by a surprize when the king, and the inhabitants were not aware of it, which we had before also told us, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039">Jer 51:39-40</a>. Requite - The wrongs done to his people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057">Jeremiah 51:57</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058">Jeremiah 51:58</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_058">jer 51:58</a></font></span></p>Weary - Though the people should labour to quench this fire, or to rebuild this city, yet it would be all lost labour. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059">Jeremiah 51:59</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_059">jer 51:59</a></font></span></p>In the fourth year - This circumstance lets us know that this prophecy was many years before Babylon was destroyed; for it was seven years before Jerusalem was taken; so as it must be above sixty years before it was fulfilled in the first degree. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#061">Jeremiah 51:61</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_061">jer 51:61</a></font></span></p>Shalt read - Probably to the Jews, that were in Babylon. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#062">Jeremiah 51:62</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_062">jer 51:62</a></font></span></p>Shalt say - Thou shalt testify that thou believest what thou hast read. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064">Jeremiah 51:64</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_064">jer 51:64</a></font></span></p>Weary - With that weight of judgment which shall be upon them. The words - The prophetical words of Jeremiah; for the matter of the next chapter is historical, and the book of Lamentations is not prophetical.
