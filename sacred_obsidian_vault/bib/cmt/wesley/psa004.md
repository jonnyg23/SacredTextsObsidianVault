 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 4</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001">Psalms 4:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 4:1</a></font></span></p>O God - The witness and defender of my righteous cause. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002">Psalms 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 4:2</a></font></span></p>My glory - By his glory probably he means that honour which God had conferred upon him. Vanity - Wickedness. Lying - Those calumnies which they raised against him, to make him odious to all the people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003">Psalms 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 4:3</a></font></span></p>Godly - Me, whom, though you traduce as an hypocrite, God hath pronounced to he a man after his own heart, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014">Sa1 13:14</a>. For himself - In his stead, or to be his vicegerent, as all kings are, and especially the kings of God's own people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004">Psalms 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 4:4</a></font></span></p>In awe - Be afraid, if not of me, yet of God, who hath engaged in my cause. Sin not - By prosecuting your rebellion against God's authority. On your bed - Calmly consider these things in the silent night, when you are at leisure from distracting business. Be still - Compose your tumultuous minds. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005">Psalms 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 4:5</a></font></span></p>Offer - Unto God, that he may be reconciled to you. Righteousness - Righteous sacrifices; which requires that the persons offering them be righteous and do righteous things, and offer them with an honest mind, with faith and true repentance. Without which, he intimates, that all their sacrifices were of no esteem with God, and would be wholly unprofitable to them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006">Psalms 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 4:6</a></font></span></p>Many - Of my followers, who are weary of waiting upon God. Who - Who will put an end to our troubles, and give us tranquility. Lift up - Upon me and my friends. Give us an assurance of thy love, and evidence it by thy powerful assistance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007">Psalms 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 4:7</a></font></span></p>Thou hast - Whatsoever thou shalt do with me for the future, I have at present unspeakable satisfaction in the testimonies of thy love to my soul; more than worldly persons have in the time of a plentiful harvest. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008">Psalms 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 4:8</a></font></span></p>In peace - In tranquility of mind, resting securely upon God's promises.
