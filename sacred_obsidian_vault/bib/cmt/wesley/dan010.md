 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002">Daniel 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">dan 10:2</a></font></span></p>Was mourning - Because he foresaw the many calamities that would befall the Jews for their sins, especially for destroying the Messiah, and rejecting his gospel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004">Daniel 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">dan 10:4</a></font></span></p>The first month - Nisan, which is March. Hiddekel - Or Tigris. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005">Daniel 10:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">dan 10:5</a></font></span></p>A certain man - Very probably Christ, who appeared to Daniel in royal and priestly robes, and in so great brightness and majesty. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012">Daniel 10:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">dan 10:12</a></font></span></p>He - Not Christ, but Gabriel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013">Daniel 10:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">dan 10:13</a></font></span></p>Withstood me - God suffered the wicked counsels of Cambyses to take place awhile; but Daniel by his prayers, and the angel by his power, overcame him at last: and this very thing laid a foundation of the ruin of the Persian monarchies. Michael - Michael here is commonly supposed to mean Christ. I remained - To counter - work their designs against the people of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#015">Daniel 10:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">dan 10:15</a></font></span></p>I set my face - I prostrated myself upon the earth. And I became dumb - Thro' astonishment. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016">Daniel 10:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">dan 10:16</a></font></span></p>One like the sons of men - This likewise seems to have been Gabriel. I have retained no strength - Tho' he appeared to him, and spake to him as a man, yet Daniel could not bear his presence, without some dread. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020">Daniel 10:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">dan 10:20</a></font></span></p>To fight - To oppose his mischievous designs. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021">Daniel 10:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">dan 10:21</a></font></span></p>Michael - Christ alone is the protector of his church, when all the princes of the earth desert or oppose it.
