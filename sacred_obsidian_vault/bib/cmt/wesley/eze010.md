 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#003">Ezekiel 10:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 10:3</a></font></span></p>The right side - The north - side, the side towards Babylon, from whence the fire came which consumed the city. The man - Christ, the Lord of angels, who now attend his coming and commands. The cloud - As the sign of God's presence. The inner court - The court of the priests, who were chief in the apostacy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004">Ezekiel 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eze 10:4</a></font></span></p>The glory - The visible token of the presence of the God of glory. Went up - In token of his departure from the temple. And stood - Shewing his unwillingness to leave, and giving them time to return to him, he stands where he might he seen, both by priests and people, that both might be moved to repentance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#005">Ezekiel 10:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 10:5</a></font></span></p>Was heard - As a mighty and terrible thunder. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#006">Ezekiel 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eze 10:6</a></font></span></p>And stood - Either as one that deferred execution, to try whether the city would repent, or as one who was to give some farther order to the angels, that were to be the ministers of his just displeasure. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#007">Ezekiel 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 10:7</a></font></span></p>One Cherub - One of the four. And took - As a servant that reaches what his master would have. Went out - Out of the temple. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#009">Ezekiel 10:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 10:9</a></font></span></p>Looked - Attentively viewed. Beryl stone - Of sea - green. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#010">Ezekiel 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 10:10</a></font></span></p>They - The wheels. This intimates the references of providence to each other, and their dependences on each other: and the joint tendency of all to one common end, while their motions appear to us intricate and perplexed, yea, seemingly contrary. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011">Ezekiel 10:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">eze 10:11</a></font></span></p>When - The wheels moved by the cherubim, or that spirit of life, which moved the living creatures. They went - They were so framed, that they could move on all four sides without the difficulty and delay of turning. Head - Of the living creatures. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#012">Ezekiel 10:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">eze 10:12</a></font></span></p>And - Now he describes both the cherubim and wheels as full of wisdom, and as governed by an excellent wisdom. The wheels - Which the four cherubim had to move, govern, and direct. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013">Ezekiel 10:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">eze 10:13</a></font></span></p>The wheels - As to their frame and motion. It was cried - Still there was one who guided, as by vocal direction. Unto them - To each of them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014">Ezekiel 10:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eze 10:14</a></font></span></p>Every one - Of the living creatures, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006">Eze 1:6</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#017">Ezekiel 10:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">eze 10:17</a></font></span></p>For - There is a perfect harmony between second causes in their dependence on, and subjection to, the one infinite, wise, good, holy, and just God. The spirit of God directs all the creatures, upper and lower, so that they shall serve the divine purpose. Events are not determined by the wheel of fortune, which is blind, but by the wheels of providence, which are full of eyes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018">Ezekiel 10:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">eze 10:18</a></font></span></p>And stood - On the right side of the house, where the cherubim were in the inner court. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019">Ezekiel 10:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">eze 10:19</a></font></span></p>And every one - The glory, the cherubim, the wheels, all stood, respiting execution, and giving opportunity of preventing the approaching misery. The east gate - The last court, the court of the people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020">Ezekiel 10:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">eze 10:20</a></font></span></p>I knew - Either by special assurance as a prophet, or by comparing them with those which he had often seen in the temple.
