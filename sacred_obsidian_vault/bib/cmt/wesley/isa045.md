 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006">Isaiah 45:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 45:6</a></font></span></p>That - That all nations may know it by my foretelling these things so long before, and by the wonderful success that I shall give thee, and by my over - ruling thine heart and counsels, to the deliverance of my people.

Open - Open itself to bring forth those fruits which may be expected from such showers. Them - The heavens and the earth conspiring together. Together - Together with salvation. It - This great work of salvation and righteousness; whereof, tho' Cyrus is the instrument, I am the author. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isaiah 45:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 45:9</a></font></span></p>Woe - As God here makes many glorious promises to Cyrus, so he pronounces a curse upon them, who should endeavour to hinder him. Contend - Contend, if you please, with your fellow creatures, but not with your creator. Or - He turns his speech to the potter.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 45:11</a></font></span></p>Thus saith - Will you not allow me that liberty which yourselves take, of disposing of my own children and works, as I see fit?

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">isa 45:14</a></font></span></p>The labour - The wealth gotten by their labour. Thee - Jerusalem shall not only be rebuilt, but the wealth and glory of other countries shall be brought to it again. This was in part verified in Jerusalem; but it was much more fully accomplished in the church of the gospel, in the accession of the Gentiles to that church which began in Jerusalem, and from thence spread itself into all the parts of the world. Come over - They shall be taken captive by thee, and willingly submit themselves to thee. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015">Isaiah 45:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">isa 45:15</a></font></span></p>Verily - These are the words of the prophet, on contemplation of the various dispensations of God towards his church, and in the world.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">isa 45:19</a></font></span></p>In secret - The Heathen idols deliver oracles in obscure cells and caverns: but I have delivered my oracles to Israel publickly and plainly. In vain - Serve and worship me for nought. As I appointed them work, so from time to time I have given them abundant recompence. Right - I require nothing of my people which is not highly just and good. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020">Isaiah 45:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">isa 45:20</a></font></span></p>Draw near - To hear what I have said, and am now about to say. Of the nations - The remnant of the Gentiles, who survive the many destructions, which I am bringing upon the Heathen nations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021">Isaiah 45:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">isa 45:21</a></font></span></p>Take counsel - To maintain the cause of their idols. This - This great work, Babylon's destruction, and the redemption of God's people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isaiah 45:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">isa 45:23</a></font></span></p>In righteousness - It is what I will faithfully perform. Return - Without effect. It is a metaphor from ambassadors, who sometimes return to their princes without any success in their business. Every tongue - Not only the Jews, but all nations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024">Isaiah 45:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">isa 45:24</a></font></span></p>In the Lord - By or from God alone, or the Messiah, who is the true Jehovah as well as man. Righteousness - To justify me from all things which I could not be justified by the law of Moses. Strength - Support and assistance to bear all my burdens, overcome all my enemies, and perform all my duties. Men - The Gentiles shall come to Christ. Ashamed - But all his implacable enemies shall be brought to shame. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025">Isaiah 45:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">isa 45:25</a></font></span></p>All - All Israelites indeed, whether Jews or Gentiles.
