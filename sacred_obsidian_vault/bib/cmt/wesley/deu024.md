 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001">Deuteronomy 24:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">deu 24:1</a></font></span></p>Some uncleanness - Some hateful thing, some distemper of body or quality of mind not observed before marriage: or some light carriage, as this phrase commonly signifies, but not amounting to adultery. Let him write - This is not a command as some of the Jews understood it, nor an allowance and approbation, but merely a permission of that practice for prevention of greater mischiefs, and this only until the time of reformation, till the coming of the Messiah when things were to return to their first institution and purest condition. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004">Deuteronomy 24:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">deu 24:4</a></font></span></p>May not - This is the punishment of his levity and injustice in putting her away without sufficient cause, which by this offer he now acknowledgeth. Defiled - Not absolutely, as if her second marriage were a sin, but with respect to her first husband, to whom she is as a defiled or unclean woman, that is, forbidden things; forbidden are accounted and called unclean, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007">Jdg 13:7</a>, because they may no more be touched or used than an unclean thing. Thou shalt not cause the land to sin - Thou shalt not suffer such lightness to be practised, lest the people be polluted, and the land defiled and accursed by that means.

One year - That their affections may be firmly settled, so as there may be no occasions for the divorces last mentioned. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006">Deuteronomy 24:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 24:6</a></font></span></p>Mill - stone - Used in their hand - mills. Under this, he understands all other things necessary to get a livelihood, the taking away whereof is against the laws both of charity and prudence, seeing by those things alone he can be enabled both to subsist and to pay his debts. Life - His livelihood, the necessary support of his life. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010">Deuteronomy 24:10</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#011">Deuteronomy 24:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">deu 24:11</a></font></span></p>The pledge - He shall chuse what pledge he pleases, provided it be sufficient for the purpose.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">deu 24:12</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not sleep - But restore it before night, which intimates that he should take no such thing for pledge, without which a man cannot sleep. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013">Deuteronomy 24:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">deu 24:13</a></font></span></p>Bless thee - Bring down the blessing of God upon thee by his prayers: for though his prayers, if he be not a good man, shall not avail for his own behalf, yet they shall avail for thy benefit. It shall be right - Esteemed and accepted by God as a work of righteousness, or mercy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015">Deuteronomy 24:15</a></p>

For though God do visit the father's sins upon the children, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Exo 20:5</a>, yet he will not suffer men to do so. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017">Deuteronomy 24:17</a></p>
