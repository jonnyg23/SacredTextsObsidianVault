Cast not down - They were cautious not to give me any occasion to change my countenance towards them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025">Job 29:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">job 29:25</a></font></span></p>I chose - They sought to me for advice in all difficult cases, and I directed them what methods they should take.

As one - As I was ready to comfort any afflicted persons, so my consolations were always welcome to them.
