As a Jebusite - The city is put for the people, and this one city and people for all the other: all the remaining Philistines shall be as Jebusites, servants to the people of God.

The Lord God - Their God, the God of Israel, shall give the alarm to them, and sound the call to bring them together.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015">Zechariah 9:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">zac 9:15</a></font></span></p>Devour - Destroy their enemies. With sling - stones - As David did Goliath. Shall drink - In their festivals, when they offer sacrifices of thanksgiving for their victories.
