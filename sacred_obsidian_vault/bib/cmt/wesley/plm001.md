 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001">Philemon Chapter 1</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001">Philemon 1:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">plm 1:1</a></font></span></p>This single epistle infinitely transcends all the wisdom of the world. And it gives us a specimen how Christians ought to treat of secular affairs from higher principles. Paul a prisoner of Christ - To whom, as such, Philemon could deny nothing. And Timotheus - This was written before the second epistle to Timothy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022">Plm 1:22</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002">Philemon 1:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">plm 1:2</a></font></span></p>To Apphia - His wife, to whom also the business in part belonged. And the church in thy house - The Christians who meet there. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005">Philemon 1:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">plm 1:5</a></font></span></p>Hearing - Probably from Onesimus. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006">Philemon 1:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">plm 1:6</a></font></span></p>I pray that the communication of thy faith may become effectual - That is, that thy faith may be effectually communicated to others, who see and acknowledge thy piety and charity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007">Philemon 1:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">plm 1:7</a></font></span></p>The saints - To whom Philemon's house was open, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002">Plm 1:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008">Philemon 1:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">plm 1:8</a></font></span></p>I might be bold in Christ - Through the authority he hath given me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009">Philemon 1:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">plm 1:9</a></font></span></p>Yet out of love I rather entreat thee - In how handsome a manner does the apostle just hint, and immediately drop, the consideration of his power to command, and tenderly entreat Philemon to hearken to his friend, his aged friend, and now prisoner for Christ! With what endearment, in the next verse, does he call Onesimus his son, before he names his name! And as soon as he had mentioned it, with what fine address does he just touch on his former faults, and instantly pass on to the happy change that was now made upon him! So disposing Philemon to attend to his request, and the motives wherewith he was going to enforce it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010">Philemon 1:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">plm 1:10</a></font></span></p>Whom I have begotten in my bonds - The son of my age. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011">Philemon 1:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">plm 1:11</a></font></span></p>Now profitable - None should be expected to be a good servant before he is a good man. He manifestly alludes to his name, Onesimus, which signifies profitable. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012">Philemon 1:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">plm 1:12</a></font></span></p>Receive him, that is, my own bowels - Whom I love as my own soul. Such is the natural affection of a father in Christ toward his spiritual children. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013">Philemon 1:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">plm 1:13</a></font></span></p>To serve me in thy stead - To do those services for me which thou, if present, wouldest gladly have done thyself. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014">Philemon 1:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">plm 1:14</a></font></span></p>That thy benefit might not be by constraint - For Philemon could not have refused it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015">Philemon 1:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">plm 1:15</a></font></span></p>God might permit him to be separated (a soft word) for a season, that thou mightest have him for ever - Both on earth and in heaven. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016">Philemon 1:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">plm 1:16</a></font></span></p>In the flesh - As a dutiful servant. In the Lord - As a fellow - Christian. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#017">Philemon 1:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">plm 1:17</a></font></span></p>If thou accountest me a partner - So that thy things are mine, and mine are thine. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019">Philemon 1:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">plm 1:19</a></font></span></p>I will repay it - If thou requirest it. Not to say, that then owest me thyself - It cannot be expressed, how great our obligation is to those who have gained our souls to Christ. Beside - Receiving Onesimus. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#020">Philemon 1:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">plm 1:20</a></font></span></p>Refresh my bowels in Christ - Give me the most exquisite and Christian pleasure. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022">Philemon 1:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">plm 1:22</a></font></span></p>Given to you - Restored to liberty.
