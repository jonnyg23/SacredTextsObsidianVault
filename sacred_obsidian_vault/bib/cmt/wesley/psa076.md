Than - The greatest kings and empires of the earth, which in prophetic writings are often compared to mountains. And they are called mountains of prey, because they generally were established by tyranny, and maintained by preying upon their own subjects, or other kingdoms. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005">Psalms 76:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 76:5</a></font></span></p>Sleep - Even a perpetual sleep.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 76:8</a></font></span></p>Thou - Didst execute judgment upon thine enemies, by an angel from heaven: which is said to be heard, either because it was accompanied with thunders and earthquakes, or because the fame of it was quickly spread abroad.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010">Psalms 76:10</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012">Psalms 76:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 76:12</a></font></span></p>Cut off - As men do their grapes in time of vintage; so the Hebrew verb implies. The spirit - Their breath and life, as he did in the Assyrian army.
