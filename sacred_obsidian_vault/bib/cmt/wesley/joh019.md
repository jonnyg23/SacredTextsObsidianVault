 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001">John 19:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">joh 19:1</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026">Mat 27:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#015">Mar 15:15</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007">John 19:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joh 19:7</a></font></span></p>By our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God - Which they understood in the highest sense, and therefore accounted blasphemy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#008">John 19:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">joh 19:8</a></font></span></p>He was the more afraid - He seems to have been afraid before of shedding innocent blood. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#009">John 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">joh 19:9</a></font></span></p>Whence art thou? - That is, whose son art thou? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011">John 19:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joh 19:11</a></font></span></p>Thou couldst have no power over me - For I have done nothing to expose me to the power of any magistrate. Therefore he that delivered me to thee, namely, Caiaphas, knowing this, is more blamable than thou. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013">John 19:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">joh 19:13</a></font></span></p>Pilate sat down on the judgment seat - Which was then without the palace, in a place called, in Greek, the pavement, on account of a beautiful piece of Mosaic work, with which the floor was adorned: but in Hebrew, Gabbatha - Or the high place, because it stood on an eminence, so that the judge sitting on his throne might be seen and heard by a considerable number of people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014">John 19:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">joh 19:14</a></font></span></p>It was the preparation of the passover - For this reason both the Jews and Pilate were desirous to bring the matter to a conclusion. Every Friday was called the preparation, (namely, for the Sabbath.) And as often as the passover fell on a Friday, that day was called the preparation of the passover. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017">John 19:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">joh 19:17</a></font></span></p>Bearing his cross - Not the whole cross, (for that was too large and heavy,) but the transverse beam of it, to which his hands were afterward fastened. This they used to make the person to be executed carry. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#031">Mat 27:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#020">Mar 15:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026">Luk 23:26</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#019">John 19:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">joh 19:19</a></font></span></p>Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews - Undoubtedly these were the very words, although the other evangelists do not express them at large. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020">John 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">joh 19:20</a></font></span></p>It was written in Latin - For the majesty of the Roman empire; in Hebrew - Because it was the language of the nation; and in Greek - For the information of the Hellenists, who spoke that language, and came in great numbers to the feast. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#022">John 19:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">joh 19:22</a></font></span></p>What I have written, I have written - That shall stand. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023">John 19:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">joh 19:23</a></font></span></p>The vesture - The upper garment. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024">John 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">joh 19:24</a></font></span></p>They parted my garments among them - No circumstance of David's life bore any resemblance to this, or to several other passages in the 22d Psalm. So that in this scripture, as in some others, the prophet seems to have been thrown into a preternatural ecstacy, wherein, personating the Messiah, he spoke barely what the Spirit dictated, without any regard to himself. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018">Psa 22:18</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025">John 19:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">joh 19:25</a></font></span></p>His mother's sister - But we do not read she had any brother. She was her father's heir, and as such transmitted the right of the kingdom of David to Jesus: Mary, the wife of Cleopas - Called likewise Alpheus, the father, as Mary was the mother of James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#027">John 19:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">joh 19:27</a></font></span></p>Behold thy mother - To whom thou art now to perform the part of a son in my place, a peculiar honour which Christ conferred on him. From that hour - From the time of our Lord's death. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029">John 19:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">joh 19:29</a></font></span></p>A stalk of hyssop - Which in those countries grows exceeding large and strong. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021">Psa 69:21</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030">John 19:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">joh 19:30</a></font></span></p>It is finished - My suffering: the purchase of man's redemption. He delivered up his spirit - To God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050">Mat 27:50</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031">John 19:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">joh 19:31</a></font></span></p>Lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath - Which they would have accounted a profanation of any Sabbath, but of that in particular. For that Sabbath was a great day - Being not only a Sabbath, but the second day of the feast of unleavened bread (from whence they reckoned the weeks to pentecost:) and also the day for presenting and offering the sheaf of new corn: so that it was a treble solemnity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034">John 19:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">joh 19:34</a></font></span></p>Forthwith there came out blood and water - It was strange, seeing he was dead, that blood should come out; more strange, that water also; and most strange of all, that both should come out immediately, at one time, and yet distinctly. It was pure and true water, as well as pure and true blood. The asseveration of the beholder and testifier of it, shows both the truth and greatness of the miracle and mystery. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035">John 19:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">joh 19:35</a></font></span></p>His testimony is true - Valid, unexceptionable. And he knoweth - And his conscience beareth him witness, that he testifieth this for no other end, than that ye may believe. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036">John 19:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">joh 19:36</a></font></span></p>A bone of it shall not be broken - This was originally spoken of the paschal lamb, an eminent type of Christ. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046">Exo 12:46</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037">John 19:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">joh 19:37</a></font></span></p>They shall look on him whom they have pierced - He was pierced by the soldier's spear. They who have occasioned his sufferings by their sins (and who has not?) shall either look upon him in this world with penitential sorrow: or with terror, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007">Rev 1:7</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010">Zac 12:10</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038">John 19:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">joh 19:38</a></font></span></p>Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate - And Nicodemus also came - Acknowledging Christ, when even his chosen disciples forsook him. In that extremity Joseph was no longer afraid, Nicodemus no longer ashamed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041">John 19:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">joh 19:41</a></font></span></p>In the place where he was crucified - There was a garden in the same tract of land: but the cross did not stand in the garden. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#042">John 19:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">joh 19:42</a></font></span></p>Because of the preparation - That is, they chose the rather to lay him in that sepulchre which was nigh, because it was the day before the Sabbath, which also was drawing to an end, so that they had no time to carry him far.
