 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002">Jeremiah 48:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 48:2</a></font></span></p>Heshbon - Heshbon was one of the principal cities of the Moabites. Probably the enemies sat there in counsel, when they had taken it, against the other parts of the country. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003">Jeremiah 48:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jer 48:3</a></font></span></p>Horoniam - Another city of Moab.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009">Jeremiah 48:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 48:9</a></font></span></p>Give wings - The Moabites have need of wings like a bird to escape that ruin which is coming upon them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011">Jeremiah 48:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 48:11</a></font></span></p>At ease - The Moabites ever since they began to be a people, have been a quiet people. Settled - Like a cask of wine, that has not been racked but has continued in the same state. Not emptied - A metaphor of wine which is drawn out from vessel to vessel, when it is drawn off the lees. It is expounded by the next words. Therefore - And this is the reason why they retain their old sins, pride, presumption, and luxury. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012">Jeremiah 48:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jer 48:12</a></font></span></p>Wanderers - The Chaldeans, who wandered from their own country to conquer other people. Break his bottles - He had before compared the Moabites, to wine settled upon the lees, here he saith, that God would send those that should not only disturb, but destroy them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013">Jeremiah 48:13</a></p>

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#016">Jeremiah 48:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jer 48:16</a></font></span></p>Is near - Josephus tells us this destruction came upon the Moabites five years after the siege of Jerusalem.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jer 48:20</a></font></span></p>Arnon - Arnon was the name of a river; it was the border of Moab: probably the adjacent country or city might take its name from the river.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">jer 48:28</a></font></span></p>O ye - Still the prophet speaks of the Moabites, as a people whose armies were routed, and calls to them to leave their houses in cities, not promising themselves any security, either to or from their houses, or from the walls of the cities, but to get them to rocks, which are naturally fortified, and from whence (if from any place) security may be promised. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030">Jeremiah 48:30</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">jer 48:31</a></font></span></p>Kir - herez - A city of Moab. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032">Jeremiah 48:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">jer 48:32</a></font></span></p>Sibmah - Sibmah was famous in those days for vines. Jazer - Jazer was it seems first taken, and carried into captivity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036">Jeremiah 48:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">jer 48:36</a></font></span></p>Pipes - The prophet means such pipes as they were wont to use at funerals, and other sad occasions.

 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045">Jeremiah 48:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">jer 48:45</a></font></span></p>Heshbon - Heshbon was it seems a place of force. The crown - That is, the glory. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047">Jeremiah 48:47</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_047">jer 48:47</a></font></span></p>Bring again - It seems this is to be understood of a spiritual reduction of them, by calling them into the kingdom of the Messiah.
