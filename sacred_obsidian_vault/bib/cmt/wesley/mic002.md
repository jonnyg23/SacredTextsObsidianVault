 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mic 2:1</a></font></span></p>That devise - Contrive and frame mischief. Evil work - Contrive how to work it. It is in the power - Because they can; without regarding right or wrong. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002">Micah 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mic 2:2</a></font></span></p>And his house - His family, which by this means is left to poverty. And his heritage - And this is done against ancient right and possession, nay, in a case where God hath forbidden them to sell their heritage. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003">Micah 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mic 2:3</a></font></span></p>Against this family - God will devise evil against their family, as they devised evil against the family of their neighbours. Haughty - You have made others hang the head; so shall you now. Is evil - Full of miseries on the whole family of Jacob. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004">Micah 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mic 2:4</a></font></span></p>A parable - A taunting proverb. And lament - Your friends for you, and you for yourselves. He - God. Portion - Their wealth, plenty, freedom, joy and honour, into poverty, famine, servitude, grief and dishonour. How - How dreadfully hath God dealt with Israel; removing their persons into captivity, and transferring their possession to their enemies? Turning away - Turning away from us in displeasure. God hath divided our fields among others. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005">Micah 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mic 2:5</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt have - None that shall ever return to this land, to see it allotted by line and given them to possess it. In the congregation - They shall no more be the congregation of the Lord, nor their children after them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mic 2:7</a></font></span></p>That art named - You are in name, not in truth, the seed of Jacob. Straitened - The power, wisdom, and kindness of God is not less now than formerly. Are these - Are these severe proceedings the doings your God delighteth in? Do not my words - My words promise all good, to those that with honest hearts walk in the ways of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008">Micah 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mic 2:8</a></font></span></p>Is risen up - They have risen up, Israel against Judah, and Judah against Israel, and of late the tribes have conspired against one another; subjects against their kings, and great ones against the meaner sort. With the garment - You strip those that fearing no evil, go about their private affairs. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009">Micah 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mic 2:9</a></font></span></p>The women - The widows. Of my people - Of Israelites, not strangers, that were by peculiar provision from God's law, to be tenderly dealt with, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022">Exo 22:22</a>. Cast out - You have turned out of their old habitations. From their children - You have turned their children out of their houses, and estates, which were secured by the law of God from any sale beyond the jubilee; yet you have confiscated them for ever. My glory - Which was the glory of my bounty to them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010">Micah 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mic 2:10</a></font></span></p>Arise ye - Ye inhabitants of Israel, prepare for your departure out of this land. Your rest - Though it was given this people for a rest under God's wing; yet it was on condition of continued obedience. Polluted - With many, and great, and old sins. Destroy - It shall spue you out. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011">Micah 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mic 2:11</a></font></span></p>Walking - If a man pretend to have the spirit of prophesy. Saying - You shall have plenty of days, and may eat, drink, and be merry. He shall even be the prophet - Such they like and chuse.

Their fold - Their own fold, where they are safe. The multitude of men - This was fulfilled in part, when the Jews returned out of Babylon, but more fully when Christ by his gospel gathered together in one, all the children of God that were scattered abroad. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013">Micah 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mic 2:13</a></font></span></p>The breaker - To break down all opposition. The gate - The door of escape out of their captivity. No cities so strong, which the Assyrians shall not take and possess, and enter in through the gates. The Lord - Even Jehovah, as he was at the head of Israel, when he brought them out of Egypt.
