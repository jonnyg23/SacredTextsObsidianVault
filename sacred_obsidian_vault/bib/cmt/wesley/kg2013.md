 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001">4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 13</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg2 13:6</a></font></span></p>The grove - Which Ahab had planted for the worship of Baal, and which should have been destroyed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005">Deu 7:5</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">kg2 13:7</a></font></span></p>He - The king of Syria. People - Of his army, or men of war. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#008">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">kg2 13:8</a></font></span></p>His might - For though his success was not good, he shewed much personal valour. Which is noted to intimate, that the Israelites were not conquered, because of the cowardice of their king, but merely from the righteous judgment of God, who was now resolved to reckon with them for their apostacy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg2 13:14</a></font></span></p>Fallen sick, &amp;c. - He lived long: for it was sixty years since he was first called to be a prophet. It was a great mercy to Israel and especially to the sons of the prophets, that he was continued so long, a burning and a shining light. Elijah finished his testimony, in a fourth part of that time. God's prophets have their day set them, longer or shorter, as infinite wisdom sees fit. But all the latter part of his time, from the anointing of Jehu, which was forty five years before Joash began his reign, we find no mention of him, or of any thing he did, 'till we find him here upon his death bed. Yet he might be useful to the last, tho' not so famous as he had sometimes been. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg2 13:17</a></font></span></p>Eastward - Toward Syria, which lay north - eastward, from the land of Israel: this arrow is shot against the Syrians, as a token what God intended to do against them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg2 13:18</a></font></span></p>Smite - The former sign portended victory, this was to declare the number of the victories. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">kg2 13:20</a></font></span></p>Moabites invaded - The mentioning this immediately on the death of Elisha intimates, that the removal of God's faithful prophets, is a presage of judgments approaching. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg2 13:21</a></font></span></p>He revived - Which miracle God wrought, to do honour to that great prophet, and that by this seal he might confirm his doctrine, to strengthen the faith of Joash, and of the Israelites, in this promise of their success against the Syrians; and in the midst of all their calamities to comfort such Israelites as were Elisha's followers, with the hopes of eternal life, whereof this was a manifest pledge, and to awaken the rest of that people to a due care and preparation for it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023">4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">kg2 13:23</a></font></span></p>Had compassion - The slowness of God's process against sinners even when they remain impenitent must be construed to the advantage of his mercy, not the impeachment of his justice.
