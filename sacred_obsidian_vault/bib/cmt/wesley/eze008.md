 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018">Ezekiel 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">eze 8:18</a></font></span></p>Will not hear - The time was, when God was ready to have heard, even before they cried: but now they cry aloud, and yet cry in vain.
