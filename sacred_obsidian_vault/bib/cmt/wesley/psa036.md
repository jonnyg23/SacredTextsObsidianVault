 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001">Psalms 36:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 36:1</a></font></span></p>No fear - When I consider the manifold transgressions of ungodly men, I conclude within myself, that they have cast off all fear of the Divine majesty. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002">Psalms 36:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 36:2</a></font></span></p>Flattereth - He deceiveth himself with vain persuasions, that God does not mind his sins, or will not punish them. Found - Punish, as the same phrase is used, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#023">Num 32:23</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003">Psalms 36:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 36:3</a></font></span></p>Left off - Once he had some degrees of wisdom, but now he is become an open apostate. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004">Psalms 36:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">psa 36:4</a></font></span></p>Deviseth - Freely, from his own inclination, when none are present to provoke him to it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005">Psalms 36:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 36:5</a></font></span></p>Thy mercy - Mine enemies are cruel and perfidious, but thou art infinite in mercy, and faithfulness. Heavens - Is infinite and incomprehensible. Faithfulness - The truth both of thy threatenings against thine enemies, and of thy promises made to good men. The clouds - Is far above our reach, greater and higher than we can apprehend. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006">Psalms 36:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 36:6</a></font></span></p>Mountains - Stedfast and unmoveable: eminent and conspicuous to all men. Judgments - The executions of thy counsels. Deep - Unsearchable, as the ocean. Man - The worst of men; yea, the brute - beasts have experience of thy care and kindness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007">Psalms 36:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 36:7</a></font></span></p>Loving - kindness - Though all thine attributes be excellent, yet, above all, thy mercy is most excellent, or precious and amiable. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008">Psalms 36:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 36:8</a></font></span></p>Satisfied - Who trust in thee, as he now said. Fatness - With those delightful provisions, which thou hast prepared for them in heaven. The river - Which denotes both their plenty, and their perpetuity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009">Psalms 36:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">psa 36:9</a></font></span></p>Life - It is in God as in a fountain, and from him is derived to us. But - Of that glorious and blessed, and endless life, which alone is worthy of the name. Light - In the light of thy glorious presence, which shall be fully manifested, when we see thee face to face. Light - Joy and comfort, and happiness: the word light is elegantly repeated in another signification; in the former clause it is light discovering, in this light, discovered or enjoyed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011">Psalms 36:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 36:11</a></font></span></p>The foot - Of my proud and insolent enemies. Come - So as to overthrow me. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012">Psalms 36:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 36:12</a></font></span></p>There - He seems as it were to point at the place, as if it were already done.
