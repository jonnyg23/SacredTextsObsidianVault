 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001">2 Chronicles 5:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch2 5:1</a></font></span></p>The gold - The remainder of those vast sums mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014">Ch1 22:14</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#005">2 Chronicles 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch2 5:5</a></font></span></p>The ark - The ark was a type of Christ, and a token of the presence of God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world, does in effect bring the ark into our religious assemblies, if we claim it by faith and prayer. And this we should be earnest for: the temple itself, if Christ leave it, is a desolate place. Those &amp;c. - As many of them as were fit for use, it is probable, were still used. The rest were carefully laid up, as monuments of antiquity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009">2 Chronicles 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch2 5:9</a></font></span></p>To this day - When this history was first written; not when it was reviewed by Ezra: for after the return from Babylon, neither staves nor ark were any more seen. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011">2 Chronicles 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ch2 5:11</a></font></span></p>By course - According to David's appointment, 1Ch. 24:1-31, 25:1-22, which was only for the ordinary service, but in extraordinary solemnities, such as this, they all came together. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014">2 Chronicles 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch2 5:14</a></font></span></p>Glory of the Lord - And this beautified it more than all the gold with which it was overlaid, or the precious stones with which it was garnished. Yet even that was no glory, in comparison of the glory of the gospel - dispensation.
