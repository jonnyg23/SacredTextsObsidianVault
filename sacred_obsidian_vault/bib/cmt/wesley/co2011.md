 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001">2 Corinthians Chapter 11</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001">2 Corinthians 11:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">co2 11:1</a></font></span></p>I wish ye would bear - So does he pave the way for what might otherwise have given offence. With my folly - Of commending myself; which to many may appear folly; and really would be so, were it not on this occasion absolutely necessary. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002">2 Corinthians 11:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co2 11:2</a></font></span></p>For - The cause of his seeming folly is expressed in this and the following verse; the cause why they should bear with him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004">Co2 11:4</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003">2 Corinthians 11:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co2 11:3</a></font></span></p>But I fear - Love is full of these fears. Lest as the serpent - A most apposite comparison. Deceived Eve - Simple, ignorant of evil. By his subtilty - Which is in the highest degree dangerous to such a disposition. So your minds - We might therefore be tempted, even if there were no sin in us. Might be corrupted - Losing their virginal purity. From the simplicity that is in Christ - That simplicity which is lovingly intent on him alone, seeking no other person or thing. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004">2 Corinthians 11:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co2 11:4</a></font></span></p>If indeed - Any could show you another Saviour, a more powerful Spirit, a better gospel. Ye might well bear with him - But this is impossible. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006">2 Corinthians 11:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co2 11:6</a></font></span></p>If I am unskilful in speech - If I speak in a plain, unadorned way, like an unlearned person. So the Greek word properly signifies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007">2 Corinthians 11:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co2 11:7</a></font></span></p>Have I committed an offence - Will any turn this into an objection? In humbling myself - To work at my trade. That ye might be exalted - To be children of God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008">2 Corinthians 11:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co2 11:8</a></font></span></p>I spoiled other churches - I, as it were, took the spoils of them: it is a military term. Taking wages (or pay, another military word) of them - When I came to you at first. And when I was present with you, and wanted - My work not quite supplying my necessities. I was chargeable to no man - Of Corinth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009">2 Corinthians 11:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co2 11:9</a></font></span></p>For - I choose to receive help from the poor Macedonians, rather than the rich Corinthians! Were the poor in all ages more generous than the rich? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010">2 Corinthians 11:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co2 11:10</a></font></span></p>This my boasting shall not be stopped - For I will receive nothing from you. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#011">2 Corinthians 11:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">co2 11:11</a></font></span></p>Do I refuse to receive anything of you, because I love you not? God knoweth that is not the case. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012">2 Corinthians 11:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co2 11:12</a></font></span></p>Who desire any occasion - To censure me. That wherein they boast, they may be found even as we - They boasted of being "burdensome to no man." But it was a vain boast in them, though not in the apostle. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014">2 Corinthians 11:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">co2 11:14</a></font></span></p>Satan himself is transformed - Uses to transform himself; to put on the fairest appearances. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015">2 Corinthians 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co2 11:15</a></font></span></p>Therefore it is no great, no strange, thing; whose end, notwithstanding all their disguises, shall be according to their works. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016">2 Corinthians 11:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">co2 11:16</a></font></span></p>I say again - He premises a new apology to this new commendation of himself. Let no man think me a fool - Let none think I do this without the utmost necessity. But if any do think me foolish herein, yet bear with my folly. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017">2 Corinthians 11:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co2 11:17</a></font></span></p>I speak not after the Lord - Not by an express command from him; though still under the direction of his Spirit. But as it were foolishly - In such a manner as many may think foolish. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018">2 Corinthians 11:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">co2 11:18</a></font></span></p>After the flesh - That is, in external things. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#019">2 Corinthians 11:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">co2 11:19</a></font></span></p>Being wise - A beautiful irony. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020">2 Corinthians 11:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">co2 11:20</a></font></span></p>For ye suffer - Not only the folly, but the gross abuses, of those false apostles. If a man enslave you - Lord it over you in the most arbitrary manner. If he devour you - By his exorbitant demands; not - withstanding his boast of not being burdensome. If he take from you - By open violence. If he exalt himself - By the most unbounded self - commendation. If he smite you on the face - (A very possible case,) under pretence of divine zeal. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021">2 Corinthians 11:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">co2 11:21</a></font></span></p>I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak - I say, "Bear with me," even on supposition that the weakness be real which they reproach me with. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022">2 Corinthians 11:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">co2 11:22</a></font></span></p>Are they Hebrews, Israelites, the seed of Abraham - These were the heads on which they boasted. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023">2 Corinthians 11:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">co2 11:23</a></font></span></p>I am more so than they. In deaths often - Surrounding me in the most dreadful forms. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024">2 Corinthians 11:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">co2 11:24</a></font></span></p>Five times I received from the Jews forty stripes save one - Which was the utmost that the law allowed. With the Romans he sometimes pleaded his privilege as a Roman; but from the Jews he suffered all things. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025">2 Corinthians 11:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">co2 11:25</a></font></span></p>Thrice I have been shipwrecked - Before his voyage to Rome. In the deep - Probably floating on some part of the vessel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027">2 Corinthians 11:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">co2 11:27</a></font></span></p>In cold and nakedness - Having no place where to lay my head; no convenient raiment to cover me; yet appearing before noble - men, governors, kings; and not being ashamed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028">2 Corinthians 11:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">co2 11:28</a></font></span></p>Beside the things which are from without - Which I suffer on the account of others; namely, the care of all the churches - A more modest expression than if he had said, the care of the whole church. All - Even those I have not seen in the flesh. St. Peter himself could not have said this in so strong a sense. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029">2 Corinthians 11:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">co2 11:29</a></font></span></p>Who - So he had not only the care of the churches, but of every person therein. Is weak, and I am not weak - By sympathy, as well as by condescension. Who is offended - Hindered in, or turned out of, the good way. And I burn not - Being pained as though I had fire in my bosom. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030">2 Corinthians 11:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">co2 11:30</a></font></span></p>I will glory of the things that concern my infirmities - Of what shows my weakness, rather than my strength. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032">2 Corinthians 11:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">co2 11:32</a></font></span></p>The governor under Aretas - King of Arabia and Syria of which Damascus was a chief city, willing to oblige the Jews, kept the city - Setting guards at all the gates day and night. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033">2 Corinthians 11:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">co2 11:33</a></font></span></p>Through a window - Of an house which stood on the city wall.
