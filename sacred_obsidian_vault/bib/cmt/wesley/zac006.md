 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001">Zechariah Chapter 6</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001">Zechariah 6:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">zac 6:1</a></font></span></p>Four chariots - Angels who are sometimes styled chariots of God. These as employed in the affairs of church and empire, act their part in the revolution and changes of things, 'till the gospel be preached by the Messiah, and the apostles. Of brass - These denote the immoveable decrees of God, his steady execution of his counsels and the insuperable restraints upon all empires and countries, which God keeps within the barriers of such impregnable mountains. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002">Zechariah 6:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">zac 6:2</a></font></span></p>Red horses - Perhaps denoting bloody times, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004">Rev 6:4</a>. Black horses - Perhaps a time of mortality, and wasting diseases, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005">Rev 6:5</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003">Zechariah 6:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zac 6:3</a></font></span></p>White horses - Signifying joyful and prosperous affairs,  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008">Zac 1:8</a>. Grisled - A mixt state of affairs. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005">Zechariah 6:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zac 6:5</a></font></span></p>These are - The angels of heaven, who have a great share in the management of the affairs both of the church and states. Of the heavens - Which reside in heaven, 'till employed, go thence when employed, and having done their work, return thither. Standing - They stand as servants attending the command of their Lord. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006">Zechariah 6:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 6:6</a></font></span></p>The black horses - The angels signified by the black horses are the executioners of God's just displeasure. Therein - In the second chariot. The north - country - Babylon. The grisled - The angels signified by these, managed the Roman power, which was sometimes favourable, sometimes fierce and severe, to those they had to do with. The south - country - Egypt and Arabia, which lay south of Judea. It may perhaps point at their invading Africa too, whose punishments were mixed, with kindness and mercy more than the punishments of Babylon were. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007">Zechariah 6:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 6:7</a></font></span></p>Sought to go - Waited for a commission. He said - Christ who hath all power in heaven and on earth. Through the earth - Thro' the rest of the kingdoms of the world remote from Judea, but not remote from God's wise and sovereign providence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008">Zechariah 6:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 6:8</a></font></span></p>Cried he - Christ spake aloud, and called to him. Quieted my spirit - By doing what I appointed them in revenge of my peoples injuries, and by bringing my people back into Canaan. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010">Zechariah 6:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zac 6:10</a></font></span></p>Take - Of those that are come out of Babylon. Come thou - Go fetch them, if they lodge elsewhere. The same day - The same day in which they come. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011">Zechariah 6:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">zac 6:11</a></font></span></p>Make crowns - One of silver, the other of gold. Set them - Put both of them, one after another. Joshua - Who herein is now a type of Christ, king and priest for ever for his people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zechariah 6:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">zac 6:12</a></font></span></p>Unto him - Joshua, but in the hearing of others. Whose name is the Branch - Whom you know by the name of the Branch, who was called so long since. Thou, O Joshua art the portrait, he is the Branch itself. Out of his place - Of the tribe and family, and in the place foretold. He shall build - He it is, though unseen, that stands by you, who build the material temple, far inferior to the spiritual temple, which Christ will build, preserve, and dwell in for ever. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zechariah 6:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">zac 6:13</a></font></span></p>The glory - Of both kingly and priestly office; the glory of both those crowns shall abide on him. Shall sit - Which speaks both his royal magnificence, and the perpetuity of it. A priest - The great high - priest, to offer the great sacrifice to God, to make reconciliation, to intercede for his people. The counsel of peace - The peace made for God's people shall rest upon these two, the kingly and priestly office of Christ; by his priestly office he shall make their peace with God, by his kingly office he shall deliver them from their spiritual enemies. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014">Zechariah 6:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">zac 6:14</a></font></span></p>The crowns - The two crowns before mentioned. Helem - These persons we know no more of than their names. A memorial - Of the Messiah's certain and speedy coming. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015">Zechariah 6:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">zac 6:15</a></font></span></p>They that are far off - This verse hath a double reference, one to the Jews, and the building of the material temple, the other to the bringing in of the Gentiles. And this - The literal part shall come to pass in your day, if you will obey the voice of the Lord. The mystical part shall come to pass also, and, if you will believe and obey, the Gentiles shall come in and be your brethren, and help to build the temple, the spiritual temple. But if you rebel and obey not, you shall be cast out and the Gentiles be taken in, to be God's people.
