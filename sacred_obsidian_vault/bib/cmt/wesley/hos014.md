 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001">Hosea Chapter 14</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001">Hosea 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">hos 14:1</a></font></span></p>Fallen - Thy sins have involved thee in endless troubles. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002">Hosea 14:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">hos 14:2</a></font></span></p>Render - This will qualify and encourage us to give the sacrifices which are more pleasing to God than calves or oxen. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003">Hosea 14:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">hos 14:3</a></font></span></p>The fatherless - All that are destitute of strength in themselves, and destitute of help from others; all that being sensible of their own helpless condition, look for it from God, who hath power, mercy, and wisdom to help. Mercy - Both the fountain and streams of goodness too, free grace, and rich bounty. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005">Hosea 14:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">hos 14:5</a></font></span></p>As the dew - I will refresh and comfort, and make fruitful in good works, such as return to me. As Lebanon - As the cedars in Lebanon, so shall the true Israel, converted backsliders, be blessed of God: so flourishing and happy shall the church be under Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006">Hosea 14:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">hos 14:6</a></font></span></p>His branches - His branches which are new sprung out, shall gather strength, and shall multiply in number. The olive - tree - Which retains its verdure all the winter and is rich in fruit; so the true Israel of God shall flourish not in fruitless beauty, but in lovely fruit, even in winter's of affliction and trouble. As Lebanon - The mountain famous for cedars, where also were the trees that afford the frankincense, and many flowers which perfume the air; such shall the spiritual fragrance of the church be to God and man. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007">Hosea 14:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">hos 14:7</a></font></span></p>They that dwell - As many as unite to the church, shall dwell under these spreading trees. Return - Revive and recover strength. As the corn - Which dies ere it lives to bring forth fruit. As the vine - Which in winter seems dead, but yet life, sap, and a fructifying virtue is in it. The scent thereof - The savour of it to God and good men shall be pleasing as the scent of the delicious wines of Lebanon. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008">Hosea 14:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">hos 14:8</a></font></span></p>I have heard him - A gracious promise from God of hearing prayers. A green fir - tree - As a weary traveller finds rest and safety under a thick tree, so there is safety and refreshment under the protection of the Lord. From me - Of God alone. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009">Hosea 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">hos 14:9</a></font></span></p>Shall understand - Which the prophet has delivered. The ways - The ways which he would have us walk in towards him, his law, his ordinances, his whole doctrine are all righteous and equal. And the ways wherein God walks towards us, in afflicting or comforting are all righteous and equal. Shall walk in them - Will approve them all, justifying the righteousness of God's displeasure, and confessing he remembereth mercy in the midst of judgment. And justifying the righteousness of his precepts by endeavouring to observe them. The transgressors - Wilful, obstinate sinners, stumble and are offended at his commands, but more at his judgments; they cast off the one, and vainly hope to shift off the other, 'till at last they fall under the weight of their own sins and God's wrath.
