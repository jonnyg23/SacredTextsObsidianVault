 <p>
 </p><p>Seventy weeks 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>These are "weeks" or more accurately, sevens of years; seventy weeks of seven years each. Within these "weeks" the national chastisement must be ended and the nation re-established in everlasting righteousness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</a>). The seventy weeks are divided into seven = 49 years; sixty-two = 434 years; one = 7 years (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025">Dan 9:25-27</a>). In the seven weeks = 49 years, Jerusalem was to be rebuilt in "troublous times." This was fulfilled, as Ezra and Nehemiah record. Sixty-two weeks = 434 years, thereafter Messiah was to come (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025">Dan 9:25</a>). This was fulfilled in the birth and manifestation of Christ. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26</a>) is obviously an indeterminate period. The date of the crucifixion is not fixed. It is only said to be "after" the threescore and two weeks. It is the first event in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26</a>). The second event is the destruction of the city, fulfilled A.D. 70. Then, "unto the end," a period not fixed, but which has already lasted nearly 2000 years. To Daniel was revealed only that wars and desolations should continue (Compare (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006">Mat 24:6-14</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The New Testament reveals, that which was hidden from the Old Testament prophets; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011">Mat 13:11-17</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001">Eph 3:1-10</a>) that during this period should be accomplished the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001">Mat 13:1-50</a>) and the out-calling of the Church; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018">Mat 16:18</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025">Rom 11:25</a>). When the Church-age will end, and the seventieth week begin, is nowhere revealed. Its duration can be but seven years. To make it more violates the principle of interpretation already confirmed by fulfilment. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027">Dan 9:27</a>) deals with the last week. The "he" of (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027">Dan 9:27</a>) is the "prince that shall come" of (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26</a>); whose people (Rome) destroyed the temple, A.D. 70. He is the same with the "little horn" of chapter 7. He will covenant with the Jews to restore their temple sacrifices for one week (seven years), but in the middle of that time he will break the covenant and fulfil; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011">Dan 12:11</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">Th2 2:3</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">Th2 2:4</a>). Between the sixty-ninth week, after which Messiah was cut off, and the seventieth week, within which the "little horn" of Daniel 7. will run his awful course, intervenes this entire Church-age. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027">Dan 9:27</a>) deals with the last three and a half years of the seven, which are identical with the "great tribulation." (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015">Mat 24:15-28</a>) "time of trouble" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan 12:1</a>) hour of temptation" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010">Rev 3:10</a>).

 </p><p>(see "Tribulation,"; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005">Psa 2:5</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014">Rev 7:14</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>make reconciliation 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>There is no word in the Old Testament properly rendered reconcile. In the A.V. The English word is found (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004">Sa1 29:4</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#024">Ch2 29:24</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030">Lev 6:30</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015">Lev 8:15</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#020">Lev 16:20</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#015">Eze 45:15</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017">Eze 45:17</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020">Eze 45:20</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</a>) but always improperly; atonement is invariably the meaning. Reconciliation is a New Testament doctrine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</a>)?

 <p>
 </p><p>from the going forth of the commandment 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Three decrees concerning Jerusalem are recorded, that of Cyrus, B.C. 536 (Ussher), for the restoration of the "house of the Lord God of Israel" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022">Ch2 36:22</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023">Ch2 36:23</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1-3</a>) that of Darius (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003">Eze 6:3-8</a>) B.C. 521-486), and that of Artaxerxes in his seventh year. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#007">Eze 7:7</a>) say, B.C. 458). Artaxerxes in his twentieth year, B.C. 444 (Hales, Jahn), 446 (A.V.), 454 (Ussher, Hengstenberg), gave permission for the rebuilding of the "city," i.e, "Jerusalem" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001">Neh 2:1-8</a>). The latter decree is, obviously, that from which the "seven weeks" (49 years) run, unless by "the commandment to restore," etc. Is meant the divine decree (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023">Dan 9:23</a>). In the present state of biblical chronology the date of the decree of Artaxerxes cannot be unanswerably fixed farther than to say that it was issued between 454 and 444 B.C. In either case we are brought to the time of Christ. Prophetic time is invariably so near as to give full warning, so indeterminate as to give no satisfaction to mere curiosity. (Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036">Mat 24:36</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007">Act 1:7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The 434 years reckon, of course, from the end of the seven weeks so that the whole time from "the going forth of the commandment to restore," etc, "unto the Messiah" is sixty-nine weeks of years, or 483 years.

 <p>
 </p><p>abominations 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015">Mat 24:15</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The expression occurs three times in Daniel. In; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027">Dan 9:27</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011">Dan 12:11</a>) the reference is to the "Beast," "man of sin"; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">Th2 2:3</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">Th2 2:4</a>) and is identical with (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015">Mat 24:15</a>). In (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031">Dan 11:31</a>) the reference is to the act of Antiochus Epiphanes, the prototype of the man of sin, who sacrificed a sow upon the altar, and entered the holy of holies.
