 </p><p>El-beth-el 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That is, the God of Bethel. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Compare (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019">Gen 28:19</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>There it was the place as the scene of the ladder vision which impressed jacob. He called the place "Bethel," that is, the house of God. Now it is the God of the place, rather than the place, and he calls it El-Bethel, that is, "the God of the house of God." Compare (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020">Gen 33:20</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>drink offering 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The first mention of the drink-offering. It is not mentioned among the Levitical offerings of Leviticus 1-7, though included in the instructions for sacrifice in the land (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#005">Num 15:5-7</a>). It was always "poured out," never drunk, and may be considered a type of Christ in the sense of; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014">Psa 22:14</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012">Isa 53:12</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>Benjamin 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That is, Son of my right hand. Benjamin, "son of sorrow" to his mother, but "son of my right hand" to his father, becomes thus a double type of Christ. As Ben-oni He was the suffering One because of whom a sword pierced His mother's heart (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035">Luk 2:35</a>) as Benjamin, head of the warrior tribe (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027">Gen 49:27</a>) firmly joined to Judah the kingly tribe; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008">Gen 49:8-12</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021">Kg1 12:21</a>) he becomes a type of the victorious One. It is noteworthy that Benjamin was especially honoured among the Gentiles (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#022">Gen 45:22</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>So manifold are the distinctions of Christ that many personal types of Him are needed. Joseph is not complete, Benjamin standing only for Christ the sorrowful One (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003">Isa 53:3</a>); (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004">Isa 53:4</a>) yet have power on earth. 
 </p><p>
