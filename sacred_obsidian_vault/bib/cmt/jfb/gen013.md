An Arab sheik is considered rich who has a hundred or two hundred tents, from sixty to a hundred camels, a thousand sheep and goats respectively. And Abram being very rich, must have far exceeded that amount of pastoral property. "Gold and silver" being rare among these peoples, his probably arose from the sale of his produce in Egypt.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 13:4</a></font></span></p>there Abram called on the name of the Lord--He felt a strong desire to reanimate his faith and piety on the scene of his former worship: it might be to express humility and penitence for his misconduct in Egypt or thankfulness for deliverance from perils--to embrace the first opportunity on returning to Canaan of leading his family to renew allegiance to God and offer the typical sacrifices which pointed to the blessings of the promise.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">gen 13:7</a></font></span></p>And there was a strife--Abraham's character appears here in a most amiable light. Having a strong sense of religion, he was afraid of doing anything that might tend to injure its character or bring discredit on its name, and he rightly judged that such unhappy effects would be produced if two persons whom nature and grace had so closely connected should come to a rupture [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#008">Gen 13:8</a>]. Waiving his right to dictate, he gave the freedom of choice to Lot. The conduct of Abraham was not only disinterested and peaceable, but generous and condescending in an extraordinary degree, exemplifying the Scripture precepts (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032">Mat 6:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010">Rom 12:10-11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004">Phi 2:4</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">gen 13:10</a></font></span></p>Lot lifted up his eyes--Travellers say that from the top of this hill, a little "to the east of Beth-el" [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008">Gen 12:8</a>], they can see the Jordan, the broad meadows on either bank, and the waving line of verdure which marks the course of the stream.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 13:11</a></font></span></p>Then Lot chose him all the plain--a choice excellent from a worldly point of view, but most inexpedient for his best interests. He seems, though a good man, to have been too much under the influence of a selfish and covetous spirit: and how many, alas! imperil the good of their souls for the prospect of worldly advantage.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">gen 13:14</a></font></span></p>Lift up now thine eyes . . . all the land which thou seest--So extensive a survey of the country, in all directions, can be obtained from no other point in the neighborhood; and those plains and hills, then lying desolate before the eyes of the solitary patriarch, were to be peopled with a mighty nation "like the dust of the earth in number," as they were in Solomon's time (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020">Kg1 4:20</a>).
