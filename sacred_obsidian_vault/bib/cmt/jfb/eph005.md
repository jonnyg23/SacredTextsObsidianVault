CIRCUMSPECTION IN WALK: REDEEMING THE TIME: BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT: SINGING TO THE LORD WITH THANKFULNESS: THE WIFE'S DUTY TO THE HUSBAND RESTS ON THAT OF THE CHURCH TO CHRIST. (Eph. 5:1-33)
 <p>
 </p><p>therefore--seeing that "God in Christ forgave you" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032">Eph 4:32</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>followers--Greek, "imitators" of God, in respect to "love" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</a>): God's essential character (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016">Jo1 4:16</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as dear children--Greek, "as children beloved"; to which <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002">Eph 5:2</a> refers, "As Christ also loved us" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019">Jo1 4:19</a>). "We are sons of men, when we do ill; sons of God, when we do well" [AUGUSTINE, on Psalm 52]; (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44-45</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048">Mat 5:48</a>). Sonship infers an absolute necessity of imitation, it being vain to assume the title of son without any similitude of the Father [PEARSON].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eph 5:2</a></font></span></p>And--in proof that you are so. 
 <p>
 </p><p>walk in love--resuming <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001">Eph 4:1</a>, "walk worthy of the vocation." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as Christ . . . loved us--From the love of the Father he passes to the love of the Son, in whom God most endearingly manifests His love to us. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>given himself for us--Greek, "given Himself up (namely, to death, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020">Gal 2:20</a>) for us," that is, in our behalf: not here vicarious substitution, though that is indirectly implied, "in our stead." The offerer, and the offering that He offered, were one and the same (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013">Joh 15:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008">Rom 5:8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>offering and a sacrifice--"Offering" expresses generally His presenting Himself to the Father, as the Representative undertaking the cause of the whole of our lost race (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6-8</a>), including His life of obedience; though not excluding His offering of His body for us (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010">Heb 10:10</a>). It is usually an unbloody offering, in the more limited sense. "Sacrifice" refers to His death for us exclusively. Christ is here, in reference to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</a> (quoted again in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5</a>), represented as the antitype of all the offerings of the law, whether the unbloody or bloody, eucharistical or propitiatory. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for a sweet-smelling savour--Greek, "for an odor of a sweet smell," that is, God is well pleased with the offering on the ground of its sweetness,and so is reconciled to us (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006">Eph 1:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018">Co2 5:18-19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006">Heb 10:6-17</a>). The ointment compounded of principal spices, poured upon Aaron's head, answers to the variety of the graces by which He was enabled to "offer Himself a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor." Another type, or prophecy by figure, was "the sweet savor" ("savor of rest," Margin) which God smelled in Noah's sacrifice (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021">Gen 8:21</a>). Again, as what Christ is, believers also are (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017">Jo1 4:17</a>), and ministers are: Paul says (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017">Co2 2:17</a>) "we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Ephesians 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eph 5:3</a></font></span></p>once named--Greek, "Let it not be even named" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004">Eph 5:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012">Eph 5:12</a>). "Uncleanness" and "covetousness" are taken up again from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019">Eph 4:19</a>. The two are so closely allied that the Greek for "covetousness" (pleonexia) is used sometimes in Scripture, and often in the Greek Fathers, for sins of impurity. The common principle is the longing to fill one's desire with material objects of sense, outside of God. The expression, "not be even named," applies better to impurity, than to "covetousness."
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004">Ephesians 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eph 5:4</a></font></span></p>filthiness--obscenity in act or gesture. 
 <p>
 </p><p>foolish talking--the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together. The Greek of it, and of "filthiness," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>nor--rather, "or" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>jesting--Greek, "eutrapelia"; found nowhere else in the New Testament: implying strictly that versatility which turns about and adapts itself, without regard to principle, to the shifting circumstances of the moment, and to the varying moods of those with whom it may deal. Not scurrile buffoonery, but refined "persiflage" and "badinage," for which Ephesus was famed [PLAUTUS, A Boastful Soldier, 3.1,42-52], and which, so far from being censured, was and is thought by the world a pleasant accomplishment. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008">Col 3:8</a>, "filthy communication" refers to the foulness; "foolish talking," to the folly; "jesting," to the false refinement (and trifling witticism [TITTMANN]) Of discourse unseasoned with the salt of grace [TRENCH]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>not convenient--"unseemly"; not such "as become saints" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>rather giving of thanks--a happy play on sounds in Greek, "eucharistia" contrasted with "eutrapelia"; refined "jesting" and subtle humor sometimes offend the tender feelings of grace; "giving of thanks" gives that real cheerfulness of spirit to believers which the worldly try to get from "jesting" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019">Eph 5:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013">Jam 5:13</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005">Ephesians 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eph 5:5</a></font></span></p>this ye know--The oldest manuscripts read, "Of this ye are sure knowing"; or as ALFORD, "This ye know being aware." 
 <p>
 </p><p>covetous . . . idolater-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005">Col 3:5</a>). The best reading may be translated, That is to say, literally, which is (in other words) an idolater. Paul himself had forsaken all for Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010">Co2 6:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027">Co2 11:27</a>). Covetousness is worship of the creature instead of the Creator, the highest treason against the King of kings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003">Sa1 15:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mat 6:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019">Phi 3:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015">Jo1 2:15</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>hath--The present implies the fixedness of the exclusion, grounded on the eternal verities of that kingdom [ALFORD]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>of Christ and of God--rather, as one Greek article is applied to both, "of Christ and God," implying their perfect oneness, which is consistent only with the doctrine that Christ is God (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012">Th2 1:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021">Ti1 5:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013">Ti1 6:13</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006">Ephesians 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eph 5:6</a></font></span></p>vain--empty, unreal words, namely, palliations of "uncleanness," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3-4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020">Isa 5:20</a> (that it is natural to indulge in love), "covetousness" (that it is useful to society that men should pursue gain), and "jesting" (that it is witty and clever, and that God will not so severely punish for such things). 
 <p>
 </p><p>because of these things--uncleanness, covetousness, &amp;c. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3-5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cometh--present, not merely "shall come." Is as sure as if already come. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>children--rather, "sons of disobedience" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2-3</a>). The children of unbelief in doctrine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020">Deu 32:20</a>) are "children of disobedience" in practice, and these again are "children of wrath."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007">Ephesians 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eph 5:7</a></font></span></p>Here fellowship with wicked workers is forbidden; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a>, with their wicked works.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Ephesians 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eph 5:8</a></font></span></p>sometimes--"once." The emphasis is on "were." Ye ought to have no fellowship with sin, which is darkness, for your state as darkness is now PAST. Stronger than "in darkness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019">Rom 2:19</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>light--not merely "enlightened"; but light enlightening others (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013">Eph 5:13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in--in union with the Lord, who is THE LIGHT. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>children of light--not merely "of the light"; just as "children of disobedience" is used on the opposite side; those whose distinguishing characteristic is light. PLINY, a heathen writing to Trajan, bears unwilling testimony to the extraordinary purity of Christians' lives, contrasted with the people around them.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009">Ephesians 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eph 5:9</a></font></span></p>fruit of the Spirit--taken by transcribers from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022">Gal 5:22</a>. The true reading is that of the oldest manuscripts, "The fruit of THE LIGHT"; in contrast with "the unfruitful works of darkness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a>). This verse is parenthetic. Walk as children of light, that is, in all good works and words, "FOR the fruit of the light is [borne] in [ALFORD; but BENGEL, 'consists in'] all goodness [opposed to 'malice,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031">Eph 4:31</a>], righteousness [opposed to 'covetousness,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3</a>] and truth [opposed to 'lying,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025">Eph 4:25</a>]."
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010">Ephesians 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eph 5:10</a></font></span></p>Proving--construed with "walk" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001">Rom 12:1-2</a>). As we prove a coin by the eye and the ear, and by using it, so by accurate and continued study, and above all by practice and experimental trial, we may prove or test "what is acceptable unto the Lord." This is the office of "light," of which believers are "children," to manifest what each thing is, whether sightly or unsightly.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Ephesians 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">eph 5:11</a></font></span></p>unfruitful works of darkness--Sins are terminated in themselves, and therefore are called "works," not "fruits" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019">Gal 5:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022">Gal 5:22</a>). Their only fruit is that which is not in a true sense fruit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032">Deu 32:32</a>), namely, "death" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021">Rom 6:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008">Gal 6:8</a>). Plants cannot bear "fruit" in the absence of light. Sin is "darkness," and its parent is the prince of darkness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012">Eph 6:12</a>). Graces, on the other hand, as flourishing in "the light," are reproductive, and abound in fruits; which, as harmoniously combining in one whole, are termed (in the singular) "the FRUIT of the Spirit" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009">Eph 5:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>rather, &amp;c.--Translate as Greek, "rather even reprove them" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mat 5:14-16</a>). Not only "have no fellowship, but even reprove them," namely, in words, and in your deeds, which, shining with "the light," virtually reprove all that is contrary to light (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013">Eph 5:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019">Joh 3:19-21</a>). "Have no fellowship," does not imply that we can avoid all intercourse (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010">Co1 5:10</a>), but "avoid such fellowship as will defile yourselves"; just as light, though it touch filth, is not soiled by it; nay, as light detects it, so, "even reprove sin."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012">Ephesians 5:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">eph 5:12</a></font></span></p>The Greek order is, "For the things done in secret by them, it is a shame even to speak of." The "for" gives his reason for "not naming" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3</a>) in detail the works of darkness, whereas he describes definitely (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009">Eph 5:9</a>) "the fruit of the light" [BENGEL]. "Speak of," I think, is used here as "speaking of without reproving," in contrast to "even reprove them." Thus the "for" expresses this, Reprove them, for to speak of them without reproving them, is a shame (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3</a>). Thus "works of darkness" answers to "things done in secret."
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013">Ephesians 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">eph 5:13</a></font></span></p>that are reproved--rather, "when they are reproved," namely, by you (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>whatsoever doth make manifest--rather, "everything that is (that is, suffers itself to be) made manifest (or 'shone upon,' namely, by your 'reproving,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a>) is (thenceforth no longer 'darkness,' <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8</a>, but) light." The devil and the wicked will not suffer themselves to be made manifest by the light, but love darkness, though outwardly the light shines round them. Therefore, "light" has no transforming effect on them, so that they do not become light (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019">Joh 3:19-20</a>). But, says the apostle, you being now light yourselves (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8</a>), by bringing to light through reproof those who are in darkness, will convert them to light. Your consistent lives and faithful reproofs will be your "armor of light" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012">Rom 13:12</a>) in making an inroad on the kingdom of darkness.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014">Ephesians 5:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eph 5:14</a></font></span></p>Wherefore--referring to the whole foregoing argument (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013">Eph 5:13</a>). Seeing that light (spiritual) dispels the pre-existing darkness, He (God) saith . . . (compare the same phrase, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008">Eph 4:8</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Awake--The reading of all the oldest manuscripts is "Up!" or, "Rouse thee!" a phrase used in stirring men to activity. The words are a paraphrase of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isa 60:1-2</a>, not an exact quotation. The word "Christ," shows that in quoting the prophecy, he views it in the light thrown on it by its Gospel fulfilment. As Israel is called on to "awake" from its previous state of "darkness" and "death" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010">Isa 59:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002">Isa 60:2</a>), for that her Light is come; so the Church, and each individual is similarly called to awake. Believers are called on to "awake" out of sleep; unbelievers, to "arise" from the dead (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005">Mat 25:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011">Rom 13:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006">Th1 5:6</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001">Eph 2:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Christ--"the true light," "the Sun of righteousness." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>give thee light--rather, as Greek, "shall shine upon thee" (so enabling thee by being "made manifest" to become, and be, by the very fact, "light," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013">Eph 5:13</a>; then being so "enlightened," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018">Eph 1:18</a>, thou shalt be able, by "reproving," to enlighten others).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015">Ephesians 5:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">eph 5:15</a></font></span></p>that--rather as Greek, "See how ye walk," &amp;c. The double idea is compressed into one sentence: "See (take heed) how ye walk," and "See that ye walk circumspectly." The manner, as well as the act itself, is included. See how ye are walking, with a view to your being circumspect (literally, accurate, exact) in your walk. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005">Col 4:5</a>, "Walk in wisdom (answering to 'as wise' here) toward them that are without" (answering to "circumspectly," that is, correctly, in relation to the unbelievers around, not giving occasion of stumbling to any, but edifying all by a consistent walk). 
 <p>
 </p><p>not as fools--Greek, "not as unwise, but as wise."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016">Ephesians 5:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eph 5:16</a></font></span></p>Redeeming the time-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005">Col 4:5</a>). Greek, "Buying up for yourselves the seasonable time" (whenever it occurs) of good to yourselves and to others. Buying off from the vanities of "them that are without" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005">Col 4:5</a>), and of the "unwise" (here in Ephesians), the opportune time afforded to you for the work of God. In a narrower sense, special favorable seasons for good, occasionally presenting themselves, are referred to, of which believers ought diligently to avail themselves. This constitutes true "wisdom" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015">Eph 5:15</a>). In a larger sense, the whole season from the time that one is spiritually awakened, is to be "redeemed" from vanity for God (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002">Co2 6:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002">Pe1 4:2-4</a>). "Redeem" implies the preciousness of the opportune season, a jewel to be bought at any price. WAHL explains, "Redeeming for yourselves (that is, availing yourselves of) the opportunity (offered you of acting aright), and commanding the time as a master does his servant." TITTMANN, "Watch the time, and make it your own so as to control it; as merchants look out for opportunities, and accurately choose out the best goods; serve not the time, but command it, and it shall do what you approve."

Besides, there are many special evil days (in persecution, sickness, &amp;c.) when the Christian is laid by in silence; therefore he needs the more to improve the seasonable times afforded to him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013">Amo 5:13</a>), which Paul perhaps alludes to.

Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the prophets, for example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that caused by wine. So also in ordinary Christians the Spirit dwells not in the mind that seeks the disturbing influences of excitement, but in the well-balanced prayerful mind. Such a one expresses his joy, not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of thankfulness.

 </p><p>in the fear of God--All the oldest manuscripts and authorities read, "in the fear of CHRIST." The believer passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be "the servant of Christ" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022">Co1 7:22</a>), which, through the instinct of love to Him, is really to be "the Lord's freeman"; for he is "under the law to Christ" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021">Co1 9:21</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036">Joh 8:36</a>). Christ, not the Father (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022">Joh 5:22</a>), is to be our judge.

The Church's relation to Christ in His everlasting purpose, is the foundation and archetype of the three greatest of earthly relations, that of husband and wife (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022">Eph 5:22-33</a>), parent and child (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001">Eph 6:1-4</a>), master and servant (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004">Eph 6:4-9</a>). The oldest manuscripts omit "submit yourselves"; supplying it from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021">Eph 5:21</a>, "Ye wives (submitting yourselves) unto your own husbands." "Your own" is an argument for submissiveness on the part of the wives; it is not a stranger, but your own husbands whom you are called on to submit unto (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016">Gen 3:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002">Co1 7:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034">Co1 14:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018">Col 3:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005">Tit 2:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001">Pe1 3:1-7</a>). Those subject ought to submit themselves, of whatever kind their superiors are. "Submit" is the term used of wives: "obey," of children (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001">Eph 6:1</a>), as there is a greater equality between wives and husbands, than between children and parents. 
 <p>
 </p><p>as unto the Lord--Submissiveness is rendered by the wife to the husband under the eye of Christ, and so is rendered to Christ Himself. The husband stands to the wife in the relation that the Lord does to the Church, and this is to be the ground of her submission: though that submission is inferior in kind and degree to that which she owes Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024">Eph 5:24</a>).

 </p><p>and he is--The oldest manuscripts read, "Himself (being) Saviour," omitting "and," and "is." In Christ's case, the Headship is united with, nay gained by, His having SAVED the body in the process of redemption; so that (Paul implies) I am not alleging Christ's Headship as one entirely identical with that other, for He has a claim to it, and office in it, peculiar to Himself [ALFORD]. The husband is not saviour of the wife, in which particular Christ excels; hence, "But" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024">Eph 5:24</a>) follows [BENGEL].

Then have a solicitude for her as Christ had for the Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023">Eph 5:23</a>, "Himself the Saviour of the body"); and "if it be necessary to give thy life for her, or to be cut in ten thousand pieces, or to endure any other suffering whatever, do not refuse it; and if you suffer thus, not even so do you do what Christ has done; for you indeed do so being already united to her, but He did so for one that treated Him with aversion and hatred. As, therefore, He brought to His feet one that so treated Him, and that even wantonly spurned Him, by much tenderness of regard, not by threats, insults, and terror: so also do you act towards your wife, and though you see her disdainful and wantonly wayward, you will be able to bring her to your feet by much thoughtfulness for her, by love, by kindness. For no bound is more sovereign in binding than such bonds, especially in the case of husband and wife. For one may constrain a servant by fear, though not even he is so to be bound to you; for he may readily run away. But the companion of your life, the mother of your children, the basis of all your joy, you ought to bind to you, not by fear and threats, but by love and attachment" [CHRYSOSTOM].

So it ought to be translated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005">Tit 3:5</a>, the only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs. As the bride passed through a purifying bath before marriage, so the Church (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002">Rev 21:2</a>). He speaks of baptism according to its high ideal and design, as if the inward grace accompanied the outward rite; hence he asserts of outward baptism whatever is involved in a believing appropriation of the divine truths it symbolizes, and says that Christ, by baptism, has purified the Church [NEANDER] (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021">Pe1 3:21</a>).

So AUGUSTINE [Tract 80, in John], "Take away the word, and what is the water save water? Add the word to the element, and it becomes a sacrament, being itself as it were the visible word." The regenerating efficacy of baptism is conveyed in, and by, the divine word alone.

Holiness and glory are inseparable. "Cleansing" is the necessary preliminary to both. Holiness is glory internal; glory is holiness shining forth outwardly. The laver of baptism is the vehicle, but the word is the nobler and true instrument of the cleansing [BENGEL]. It is Christ that prepares the Church with the necessary ornaments of grace, for presentation to Himself, as the Bridegroom at His coming again (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001">Mat 25:1</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007">Rev 19:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002">Rev 21:2</a>).

Still the Church is termed "holy" in the creed, in reference to her ideal and ultimate destination. When the Bridegroom comes, the bride shall be presented to Him wholly without spot, the evil being cut off from the body for ever (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047">Mat 13:47-50</a>). Not that there are two churches, one with bad and good intermingled, another in which there are good alone; but one and the same Church in relation to different times, now with good and evil together, hereafter with good alone [PEARSON].

But Paul is referring to the flesh of Christ. It is not our bones and flesh, but "we" that are spiritually propagated (in our soul and spirit now, and in the body hereafter, regenerated) from the manhood of Christ which has flesh and bones. We are members of His glorified body (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053">Joh 6:53</a>).

So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005">Mat 19:5</a>. In natural marriage, husband and wife combine the elements of one perfect human being: the one being incomplete without the other. So Christ, as God-man, is pleased to make the Church, the body, a necessary adjunct to Himself, the Head. He is the archetype of the Church, from whom and according to whom, as the pattern, she is formed. He is her Head, as the husband is of the wife (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005">Rom 6:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003">Co1 11:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045">Co1 15:45</a>). Christ will never allow any power to sever Himself and His bride, indissolubly joined (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006">Mat 19:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028">Joh 10:28-29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001">Joh 13:1</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">eph 5:32</a></font></span></p>Rather, "This mystery is a great one." This profound truth, beyond man's power of discovering, but now revealed, namely, of the spiritual union of Christ and the Church, represented by the marriage union, is a great one, of deep import. See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030">Eph 5:30</a>. So "mystery" is used of a divine truth not to be discovered save by revelation of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025">Rom 11:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051">Co1 15:51</a>). The Vulgate wrongly translates, "This is a great sacrament," which is made the plea by the Romish Church (in spite of the blunder having been long ago exposed by their own commentators, CAJETAN and ESTIUS) for making marriage a sacrament; it is plain not marriage in general, but that of Christ and the Church, is what is pronounced to be a "great mystery," as the words following prove, "I [emphatic] say it in regard to Christ and to the Church" (so the Greek is best translated). "I, while I quote these words out of Scripture, use them in a higher sense" [CONYBEARE and HOWSON].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">eph 5:33</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless--not to pursue further the mystical meaning of marriage. Translate, as Greek, "Do ye also (as Christ does) severally each one so love," &amp;c. The words, "severally each one," refer to them in their individual capacity, contrasted with the previous collective view of the members of the Church as the bride of Christ.
