 <p>
 </p><p>Nebuchadnezzar--the son of Nabopolassar, the founder of the Chaldee monarchy. This invasion took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's, and the first of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001">Jer 25:1</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</a>). The young king of Assyria being probably detained at home on account of his father's demise, despatched, along with the Chaldean troops on his border, an army composed of the tributary nations that were contiguous to Judea, to chastise Jehoiakim's revolt from his yoke. But this hostile band was only an instrument in executing the divine judgment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002">Kg2 24:2</a>) denounced by the prophets against Judah for the sins of the people; and hence, though marching by the orders of the Assyrian monarch, they are described as sent by the Lord (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003">Kg2 24:3</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg2 24:6</a></font></span></p>Jehoiakim slept with his fathers--This phraseology can mean nothing more than that he died; for he was not buried with his royal ancestors; and whether he fell in battle, or his body was subjected to posthumous insults, he was, according to the prediction (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019">Jer 22:19</a>), not honored with the rites of sepulture (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030">Jer 36:30</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead--The very brief reign of this prince, which lasted only three months, during which he was a humble vassal of the Assyrians, is scarcely deserving to be taken into account, and therefore is in no way contradictory to the prophetic menace denounced against his father (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030">Jer 36:30</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>Jehoiachin--that is, "God-appointed," contracted into Jeconiah and Coniah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024">Jer 22:24</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>eighteen years old when he began to reign--At the age of eight his father took him into partnership in the government (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009">Ch2 36:9</a>). He began to reign alone at eighteen.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#009">4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">kg2 24:9</a></font></span></p>he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord--Untaught by experience, and deaf to the prophetic warnings, he pursued the evil courses which had brought so many disasters upon the royal family as well as the people of Judah. This bad character is figuratively but strongly depicted (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005">Eze 19:5-7</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010">4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg2 24:10</a></font></span></p>JERUSALEM TAKEN. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010">Kg2 24:10-16</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>At that time--within three months after his accession to the throne. It was the spring of the year (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010">Ch2 36:10</a>); so early did he indicate a feeling hostile to the interests of his Assyrian liege lord, by forming a league with Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar sent his generals to besiege Jerusalem, as Jeremiah had foretold (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028">Jer 22:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020">Jer 34:20</a>), and soon after he followed in person. Convinced of the hopelessness of making any effectual resistance, Jehoiachin, going to the camp of the besiegers, surrendered (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012">Kg2 24:12</a>), in the expectation, probably, of being allowed to retain his throne as a vassal of the Assyrian empire. But Nebuchadnezzar's clemency towards the kings of Judah was now exhausted, so that Jehoiachin was sent as a captive to Babylon, according to Jeremiah's prediction (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024">Jer 22:24</a>), accompanied by the queen mother (the same who had held that dignity under Jehoahaz) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031">Kg2 23:31</a>), his generals, and officers. This happened in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, computing from the time when he was associated with his father in the government. Those that were left consisted chiefly of the poorer sort of people and the unskilled workmen. The palace and the temple were ransacked. The smaller golden vessels had been taken on the first capture of Jerusalem and placed by Nebuchadnezzar in the temple of his god as tokens of victory. They were used by Belshazzar at his impious feast [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002">Dan 5:2</a>], for the purpose of rewarding his army with these trophies, among which were probably the golden candlesticks, the ark, &amp;c. (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007">Ch2 36:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002">Dan 1:2</a>). Now the gold plating was torn off all the larger temple furniture.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">kg2 24:13</a></font></span></p>as the Lord had said--(compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017">Kg2 20:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006">Isa 39:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013">Jer 15:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</a>). The elite of the nation for rank, usefulness, and moral worth, all who might be useful in Babylon or dangerous in Palestine, were carried off to Babylon, to the number of ten thousand (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014">Kg2 24:14</a>). These are specified (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015">Kg2 24:15-16</a>), warriors, seven thousand; craftsmen and smiths, one thousand; king's wives, officers, and princes, also priests and prophets (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001">Jer 29:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001">Eze 1:1</a>), two thousand; equal to ten thousand captives in all.

 <p>
 </p><p>the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father's brother, king in his stead--Adhering to his former policy of maintaining a show of monarchy, Nebuchadnezzar appointed the third and youngest son of Josiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015">Ch1 3:15</a>), full brother of Jehoahaz, and uncle of the captive Jehoiachin. But, according to the custom of conquerors, who changed the names of the great men they took captives in war, in token of their supremacy, he gave him the new name of 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Zedekiah--that is, "The righteous of God." This being a purely Hebrew name, it seems that he allowed the puppet king to choose his own name, which was confirmed. His heart towards God was the same as that of Jehoiakim, impenitent and heedless of God's word.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020">4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">kg2 24:20</a></font></span></p>through the anger of the Lord . . . he cast them out from his presence--that is, in the course of God's righteous providence, his policy as king would prove ruinous to his country. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon--instigated by ambassadors from the neighboring states who came to congratulate him on his ascension to the throne (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003">Jer 17:3</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001">Jer 28:1</a>), and at the same time get him to join them in a common league to throw off the Assyrian yoke. Though warned by Jeremiah against this step, the infatuated and perjured (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013">Eze 17:13</a>) Zedekiah persisted in his revolt.
