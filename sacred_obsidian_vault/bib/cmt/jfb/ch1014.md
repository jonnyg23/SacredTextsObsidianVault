 <p>
 </p><p>Now Hiram king of Tyre--[See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011">Sa2 5:11</a>]. The alliance with this neighboring king, and the important advantages derived from it, were among the most fortunate circumstances in David's reign. The providence of God appeared concurrent with His promise in smoothing the early course of his reign. Having conquered the Jebusites and made Zion the royal residence, he had now, along with internal prosperity, established an advantageous treaty with a neighboring prince; and hence, in immediate connection with the mention of this friendly league, it is said, "David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch1 14:2</a></font></span></p>his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel--This is an important truth, that sovereigns are invested with royal honor and authority, not for their own sakes so much as for that of their people. But while it is true of all kings, it was especially applicable to the monarchs of Israel, and even David was made to know that all his glory and greatness were given only to fit him, as the minister of God, to execute the divine purposes towards the chosen people.

 <p>
 </p><p>David took more wives at Jerusalem--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#005">Sa2 3:5</a>). His concubines are mentioned (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#009">Ch1 3:9</a>), where also is given a list of his children (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#005">Ch1 14:5-8</a>), and those born in Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014">Sa2 5:14-16</a>). In that, however, the names of Eliphalet and Nogah do not occur, and Beeliada appears to be the same as Eliada.

 <p>
 </p><p>all the Philistines went up to seek David--in the hope of accomplishing his ruin (for so the phrase is used, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#015">Sa1 23:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002">Sa1 24:2-3</a>) before his throne was consolidated. Their hostility arose, both from a belief that his patriotism would lead him, ere long, to wipe out the national dishonor at Gilboa, and by fear, that in any invasion of their country, his thorough knowledge of their weak points would give him superior advantages. They resolved, therefore, to surprise and crush him before he was fairly seated on his throne.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ch1 14:11</a></font></span></p>they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there--In an engagement fought at Mount Perazim (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021">Isa 28:21</a>), in the valley of Rephaim, a few miles west of Jerusalem, the Philistines were defeated and put to flight.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">ch1 14:13</a></font></span></p>the Philistines yet again spread themselves--They renewed the campaign the next season, taking the same route. David, according to divine directions, did not confront them.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">ch1 14:14</a></font></span></p>Go not up after them--The text in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023">Sa2 5:23</a>, more correctly has, "Go not up." 
 <p>
 </p><p>turn away from them--that is, by stealing round a baca-grove, come upon their rear.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ch1 14:15</a></font></span></p>for God is gone forth before thee--"a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees," that is, the rustling of the leaves by a strong breeze suddenly rising, was the sign by which David was divinely apprised of the precise moment for the attack. The impetuosity of his onset was like the gush of a pent-up torrent, which sweeps away all in its course; and in allusion to this incident the place got its name.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#016">1 Chronicles 14:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ch1 14:16</a></font></span></p>from Gibeon . . . to Gazer--Geba or Gibea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025">Sa2 5:25</a>), now Yefa, in the province of Judah. The line from this to Gazer was intersected by the roads which led from Judah to the cities of the Philistines. To recover possession of it, therefore, as was effected by this decisive battle, was equivalent to setting free the whole mountain region of Judah as far as their most westerly slope [BERTHEAU].
