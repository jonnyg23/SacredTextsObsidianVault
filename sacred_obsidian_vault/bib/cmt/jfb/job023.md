 <p>
 </p><p>to-day--implying, perhaps, that the debate was carried on through more days than one (see Introduction). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>bitter-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011">Job 7:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001">Job 10:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>my stroke--the hand of God on me (Margin, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021">Job 19:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004">Psa 32:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>heavier than--is so heavy that I cannot relieve myself adequately by groaning.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003">Job 23:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">job 23:3</a></font></span></p>The same wish as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003">Job 13:3</a> (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019">Heb 10:19-22</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Seat--The idea in the Hebrew is a well-prepared throne (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007">Psa 9:7</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004">Job 23:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 23:4</a></font></span></p>order--state methodically (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018">Job 13:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026">Isa 43:26</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>fill, &amp;c.--I would have abundance of arguments to adduce.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005">Job 23:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 23:5</a></font></span></p>he--emphatic: it little matters what man may say of me, if only I know what God judges of me.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 23:6</a></font></span></p>An objection suggests itself, while he utters the wish (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005">Job 23:5</a>). Do I hereby wish that He should plead against me with His omnipotence? Far from it! (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019">Job 9:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021">Job 13:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#018">Job 30:18</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>strength--so as to prevail with Him: as in Jacob's case (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003">Hos 12:3-4</a>). UMBREIT and MAURER better translate as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020">Job 4:20</a> (I only wish that He) "would attend to me," that is, give me a patient hearing as an ordinary judge, not using His omnipotence, but only His divine knowledge of my innocence.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007">Job 23:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 23:7</a></font></span></p>There--rather, "Then": if God would "attend" to me (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>righteous--that is, the result of my dispute would be, He would acknowledge me as righteous. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>delivered--from suspicion of guilt on the part of my Judge.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008">Job 23:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 23:8</a></font></span></p>But I wish in vain. For "behold," &amp;c. 
 <p>
 </p><p>forward . . . backward--rather, "to the east--to the west." The Hebrew geographers faced the east, that is, sunrise: not the north, as we do. So "before" means east: "behind," west (so the Hindus). Para, "before"--east: Apara, "behind"--west: Daschina, "the right hand"--south: Bama, "left"--north. A similar reference to sunrise appears in the name Asia, "sunrise," Europe, "sunset"; pure Babylonian names, as RAWLINSON shows.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009">Job 23:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 23:9</a></font></span></p>Rather, "To the north." 
 <p>
 </p><p>work--God's glorious works are especially seen towards the north region of the sky by one in the northern hemisphere. The antithesis is between God working and yet not being beheld: as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011">Job 9:11</a>, between "He goeth by," and "I see Him not." If the Hebrew bears it, the parallelism to the second clause is better suited by translating, as UMBREIT, "doth hide himself"; but then the antithesis to "behold" would be lost. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>right hand--"in the south." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>hideth--appropriately, of the unexplored south, then regarded as uninhabitable because of its heat (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029">Job 34:29</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010">Job 23:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 23:10</a></font></span></p>But--correcting himself for the wish that his cause should be known before God. The omniscient One already knoweth the way in me (my inward principles: His outward way or course of acts is mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011">Job 23:11</a>. So in me, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021">Job 4:21</a>); though for some inscrutable cause He as yet hides Himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008">Job 23:8-9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>when--let Him only but try my cause, I shall, &amp;c.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011">Job 23:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 23:11</a></font></span></p>held--fast by His steps. The law is in Old Testament poetry regarded as a way, God going before us as our guide, in whose footsteps we must tread (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005">Psa 17:5</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>declined-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005">Psa 125:5</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012">Job 23:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 23:12</a></font></span></p>esteemed--rather, "laid up," namely, as a treasure found (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044">Mat 13:44</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011">Psa 119:11</a>); alluding to the words of Eliphaz (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022">Job 22:22</a>). There was no need to tell me so; I have done so already (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016">Jer 15:16</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>necessary--"Appointed portion" (of food; as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008">Pro 30:8</a>). UMBREIT and MAURER translate, "More than my law," my own will, in antithesis to "the words of His mouth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">Joh 6:38</a>). Probably under the general term, "what is appointed to me" (the same Hebrew is in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014">Job 23:14</a>), all that ministers to the appetites of the body and carnal will is included.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013">Job 23:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 23:13</a></font></span></p>in one mind--notwithstanding my innocence, He is unaltered in His purpose of proving me guilty (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012">Job 9:12</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>soul--His will (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003">Psa 115:3</a>). God's sovereignty. He has one great purpose; nothing is haphazard; everything has its proper place with a view to His purpose.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014">Job 23:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 23:14</a></font></span></p>many such--He has yet many more such ills in store for me, though hidden in His breast (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013">Job 10:13</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#015">Job 23:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 23:15</a></font></span></p>God's decrees, impossible to be resisted, and leaving us in the dark as to what may come next, are calculated to fill the mind with holy awe [BARNES].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016">Job 23:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 23:16</a></font></span></p>soft--faint; hath melted my courage. Here again Job's language is that of Jesus Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014">Psa 22:14</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017">Job 23:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 23:17</a></font></span></p>Because I was not taken away by death from the evil to come (literally, "from before the face of the darkness," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001">Isa 57:1</a>). Alluding to the words of Eliphaz (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011">Job 22:11</a>), "darkness," that is, calamity. 
 <p>
 </p><p>cut off--rather, in the Arabic sense, brought to the land of silence; my sad complaint hushed in death [UMBREIT]. "Darkness" in the second clause, not the same Hebrew word as in the first, "cloud," "obscurity." Instead of "covering the cloud (of evil) from my face," He "covers" me with it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011">Job 22:11</a>).
