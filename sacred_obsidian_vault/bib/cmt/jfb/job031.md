In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026">Job 31:26-27</a> he passes to overt idolatry.

Sabaism (from tsaba, "the heavenly hosts") was the earliest form of false worship. God is hence called in contradistinction, "Lord of Sabaoth." The sun, moon, and stars, the brightest objects in nature, and seen everywhere, were supposed to be visible representatives of the invisible God. They had no temples, but were worshipped on high places and roofs of houses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016">Eze 8:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019">Deu 4:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005">Kg2 23:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011">Kg2 23:11</a>). The Hebrew here for "sun" is light. Probably light was worshipped as the emanation from God, before its embodiments, the sun, &amp;c. This worship prevailed in Chaldea; wherefore Job's exemption from the idolatry of his neighbors was the more exemplary. Our "Sun-day," "Mon-day," or Moon-day, bear traces of Sabaism.

Job elsewhere alludes to the flood. So he might easily know of the fall, through the two links which connect Adam and Abraham (about Job's time), namely, Methuselah and Shem. Adam is representative of fallen man's propensity to concealment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013">Pro 28:13</a>). It was from God that Job did not "hide his iniquity in his bosom," as on the contrary it was from God that "Adam" hid in his lurking-place. This disproves the translation, "as men"; for it is from their fellow men that "men" are chiefly anxious to hide their real character as guilty. MAGEE, to make the comparison with Adam more exact, for my "bosom" translates, "lurking-place."

This can be realized, not in Job's way (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005">Job 42:5-6</a>); but only through Jesus Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022">Heb 10:22</a>).

Thus of the four clauses in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038">Job 31:38-39</a>, the first refers to the same subject as the fourth, the second is connected with the third by introverted parallelism. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004">Jam 5:4</a>, which plainly alludes to this passage: compare "Lord of Sabaoth" with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026">Job 31:26</a> here.

At <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#037">Job 31:37</a> would be the regular conclusion in strict art. But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038">Job 31:38-40</a> are naturally added by one whose mind in agitation recurs to its sense of innocence, even after it has come to the usual stopping point; this takes away the appearance of rhetorical artifice. Hence the transposition by EICHORN of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#038">Job 31:38-40</a> to follow <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#025">Job 31:25</a> is quite unwarranted.
