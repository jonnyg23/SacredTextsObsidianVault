 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_000">mic 0:0</a></font></span></p>MICAH was a native of Moresheth, not the same as Mareshah in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015">Mic 1:15</a>, but the town called Moresheth-gath (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014">Mic 1:14</a>), which lay near Eleutheropolis, west of Jerusalem, on the border of the Philistine country; so called to distinguish it from Moresheth of Judah. His full name is Micaiah (not the Micaiah mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008">Kg1 22:8</a>, the son of Imlah), signifying, Who is like Jehovah? The time of his prophesying is stated in the introduction to be in the reigns of Jotham. Ahaz, and Hezekiah, that is, between 757 and 699 B.C. Jeremiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018">Jer 26:18</a>) quotes <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012">Mic 3:12</a>, as delivered in the reign of Hezekiah. He was thus a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea. The idolatries practised in the reign of Ahaz accord with Micah's denunciations of such gross evils, and confirm the truth of the time assigned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001">Mic 1:1</a>. His prophecies are partly against Israel (Samaria), partly against Judah. As Samaria, Israel's metropolis, was taken first, and Jerusalem, the capital of Judah subsequently, in the introductory heading, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001">Mic 1:1</a>, Samaria is put first, then Jerusalem. He prophesies the capture of both; the Jews captivity and restoration; and the coming and reign of Messiah. His style is full, round, and perspicuous; his diction pure, and his parallelisms regular. His description of Jehovah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018">Mic 7:18-19</a>) is not surpassed by any elsewhere in Scripture. The similarity between Isaiah and Micah in some passages (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001">Mic 4:1-3</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2-4</a>) is to be accounted for by their being contemporaries, acquainted with each other's inspired writings, and having the same subjects for their theme. HENGSTENBERG maintains that the passage in Micah is the original. Isaiah was somewhat the older, being a prophet in the reign of Uzziah, Jotham's predecessor, whereas Micah began his prophecies under Jotham.
 <p>
 </p><p>The book consists of two parts: (1) the first through fifth chapters; (2) the sixth and seventh chapters, a dialogue or contestation between Jehovah and His people, in which He reproaches them with their unnatural and ungrateful conduct, and threatens judgment for their corruptions, but consoles them with the promise of restoration from captivity.

 </p><p>Micah stands sixth of the minor prophets in the Hebrew canon, but third in the Septuagint.
