 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jer 32:1</a></font></span></p>JEREMIAH, IMPRISONED FOR HIS PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM, BUYS A PATRIMONIAL PROPERTY (HIS RELATIVE HANAMEEL'S), IN ORDER TO CERTIFY TO THE JEWS THEIR FUTURE RETURN FROM BABYLON. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001">Jer 32:1-14</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>tenth year--The siege of Jerusalem had already begun, in the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jer 39:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001">Kg2 25:1</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 32:2</a></font></span></p>in . . . court of . . . prison--that is, in the open space occupied by the guard, from which he was not allowed to depart, but where any of his friends might visit him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012">Jer 32:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013">Jer 38:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028">Jer 38:28</a>). Marvellous obstinacy, that at the time when they were experiencing the truth of Jeremiah's words in the pressure of the siege, they should still keep the prophet in confinement [CALVIN]. The circumstances narrated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003">Jer 32:3-5</a>) occurred at the beginning of the siege, when Jeremiah foretold the capture of the city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001">Jer 32:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001">Jer 34:1-7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jer 39:1</a>). He was at that time put into free custody in the court of the prison. At the raising of the siege by Pharaoh-hophra, Jeremiah was on the point of repairing to Benjamin, when he was cast into "the dungeon," but obtained leave to be removed again to the court of the prison (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#012">Jer 37:12-21</a>). When there he urged the Jews, on the second advance of the Chaldeans to the siege, to save themselves by submission to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002">Jer 38:2-3</a>); in consequence of this the king, at the instigation of the princes, had him cast into a miry dungeon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004">Jer 38:4-6</a>); again he was removed to the prison court at the intercession of a courtier (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007">Jer 32:7-13</a>), where he remained till the capture of the city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#028">Jer 32:28</a>), when he was liberated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011">Jer 39:11</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</a>, &amp;c.).

Perhaps, too, before his death he was treated by Nebuchadnezzar with some favor. 
 <p>
 </p><p>though ye fight . . . shall not prosper-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004">Jer 21:4</a>).

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#006">Jeremiah 32:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 32:6</a></font></span></p>Jeremiah said--resuming the thread of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001">Jer 32:1</a>, which was interrupted by the parenthesis (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002">Jer 32:2-5</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>field . . . in Anathoth--a sacerdotal city: and so having one thousand cubits of suburban fields outside the wall attached to it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#004">Num 35:4-5</a>). The prohibition to sell these suburban fields (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#034">Lev 25:34</a>) applied merely to their alienating them from Levites to another tribe; so that this chapter does not contravene that prohibition. Besides, what is here meant is only the purchase of the use of the field till the year of jubilee. On the failure of the owner, the next of kin had the right of redeeming it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025">Lev 25:25</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003">Rut 4:3-6</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008">Jeremiah 32:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 32:8</a></font></span></p>Then I knew--Not that Jeremiah previously doubted the reality of the divine communication, but, the effect following it, and the prophet's experimentally knowing it, confirmed his faith and was the seal to the vision. The Roman historian, FLORUS (2.6), records a similar instance: During the days that Rome was being besieged by Hannibal, the very ground on which he was encamped was put up for sale at Rome, and found a purchaser; implying the calm confidence of the ultimate issue entertained by the Roman people.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009">Jeremiah 32:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 32:9</a></font></span></p>seventeen shekels of silver--As the shekel was only 2s. 4d.., the whole would be under Â£2, a rather small sum, even taking into account the fact of the Chaldean occupation of the land, and the uncertainty of the time when it might come to Jeremiah or his heirs. Perhaps the "seven shekels," which in the Hebrew (see Margin) are distinguished from the "ten pieces of silver," were shekels of gold [MAURER].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010">Jeremiah 32:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 32:10</a></font></span></p>subscribed--I wrote in the deed, "book of purchase" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012">Jer 32:12</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>weighed--coined money was not in early use; hence money was "weighed" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016">Gen 23:16</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#011">Jeremiah 32:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 32:11</a></font></span></p>evidence . . . sealed . . . open--Two deeds were drawn up in a contract of sale; the one, the original copy, witnessed and sealed with the public seal; the other not so, but open, and therefore less authoritative, being but a copy. GATAKER thinks that the purchaser sealed the one with his own seal; the other he showed to witnesses that they might write their names on the back of it and know the contents; and that some details, for example, the conditions and time of redemption were in the sealed copy, which the parties might not choose to be known to the witnesses, and which were therefore not in the open copy. The sealed copy, when opened after the seventy years' captivity, would greatly confirm the faith of those living at that time. The "law and custom" refer, probably, not merely to the sealing up of the conditions and details of purchase, but also to the law of redemption, according to which, at the return to Judea, the deed would show that Jeremiah had bought the field by his right as next of kin (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013">Lev 25:13-16</a>), [LUDOVICUS DE DIEU].

 <p>
 </p><p>before all--In sales everything clandestine was avoided; publicity was required. So here, in the court of prison, where Jeremiah was confined, there were soldiers and others, who had free access to him, present (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001">Jer 38:1</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>too hard--In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#027">Jer 32:27</a> God's reply exactly accords with Jeremiah's prayer (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014">Gen 18:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006">Zac 8:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037">Luk 1:37</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">jer 32:31</a></font></span></p>provocation of mine anger--literally, "for mine anger."

Thus, there will not be the repetition of the sentiment, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#030">Jer 32:30</a>, as in English Version; the Hebrew also favors this rendering. However, Jeremiah delights in repetitions. In English Version the words, "that I should remove it," &amp;c., stand independently, as the result of what precedes. The time is ripe for taking vengeance on them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#027">Kg2 23:27</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>from the day that they built it--Solomon completed the building of the city; and it was he who, first of the Jewish kings, turned to idolatry. It was originally built by the idolatrous Canaanites.
