 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eze 23:2</a></font></span></p>ISRAEL'S AND JUDAH'S SIN AND PUNISHMENT ARE PARABOLICALLY PORTRAYED UNDER THE NAMES AHOLAH AND AHOLIBAH. (Eze. 23:1-49)
 <p>
 </p><p>two . . . of one mother--Israel and Judah, one nation by birth from the same ancestress, Sarah.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003">Ezekiel 23:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 23:3</a></font></span></p>Even so early in their history as their Egyptian sojourn, they committed idolatries (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006">Eze 20:6-8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014">Jos 24:14</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>in their youth--an aggravation of their sin. It was at the very time of their receiving extraordinary favors from God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006">Eze 16:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022">Eze 16:22</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>they bruised--namely, the Egyptians.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#004">Ezekiel 23:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eze 23:4</a></font></span></p>Aholah--that is, "Her tent" (put for worship, as the first worship of God in Israel was in a tent or tabernacle), as contrasted with Aholibah, that is, "My tent in her." The Beth-el worship of Samaria was of her own devising, not of God's appointment; the temple-worship of Jerusalem was expressly appointed by Jehovah, who "dwelt" there, "setting up His tabernacle among the people as His" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008">Exo 25:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011">Lev 26:11-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019">Jos 22:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002">Psa 76:2</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>the elder--Samaria is called "the elder" because she preceded Judah in her apostasy and its punishment. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>they were mine--Previous to apostasy under Jeroboam, Samaria (Israel, or the ten tribes), equally with Judah, worshipped the true God. God therefore never renounced the right over Israel, but sent prophets, as Elijah and Elisha, to declare His will to them.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005">Ezekiel 23:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 23:5</a></font></span></p>when . . . mine--literally, "under Me," that is, subject to Me as her lawful husband. 
 <p>
 </p><p>neighbours--On the northeast the kingdom of Israel bordered on that of Assyria; for the latter had occupied much of Syria. Their neighborhood in locality was emblematical of their being near in corruption of morals and worship. The alliances of Israel with Assyria, which are the chief subject of reprobation here, tended to this (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019">Kg2 15:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007">Kg2 16:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009">Kg2 16:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003">Kg2 17:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009">Hos 8:9</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#006">Ezekiel 23:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eze 23:6</a></font></span></p>blue--rather, "purple" [FAIRBAIRN]. As a lustful woman's passions are fired by showy dress and youthful appearance in men, so Israel was seduced by the pomp and power of Assyria (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008">Isa 10:8</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>horsemen--cavaliers.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#007">Ezekiel 23:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 23:7</a></font></span></p>all their idols--There was nothing that she refused to her lovers.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008">Ezekiel 23:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eze 23:8</a></font></span></p>whoredoms brought from Egypt--the calves set up in Dan and Beth-el by Jeroboam, answering to the Egyptian bull-formed idol Apis. Her alliances with Egypt politically are also meant (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002">Isa 30:2-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001">Isa 31:1</a>). The ten tribes probably resumed the Egyptian rites, in order to enlist the Egyptians against Judah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002">Ch2 12:2-4</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#009">Ezekiel 23:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 23:9</a></font></span></p>God, in righteous retribution, turned their objects of trust into the instruments of their punishment: Pul, Tiglath-pileser, Esar-haddon, and Shalmaneser (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019">Kg2 15:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003">Kg2 17:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006">Kg2 17:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024">Kg2 17:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002">Ezr 4:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010">Ezr 4:10</a>). "It was their sin to have sought after such lovers, and it was to be their punishment that these lovers should become their destroyers" [FAIRBAIRN].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010">Ezekiel 23:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 23:10</a></font></span></p>became famous--literally, "she became a name," that is, as notorious by her punishment as she had been by her sins, so as to be quoted as a warning to others. 
 <p>
 </p><p>women--that is, neighboring peoples.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011">Ezekiel 23:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">eze 23:11</a></font></span></p>Judah, the southern kingdom, though having the "warning" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010">Eze 23:10</a>) of the northern kingdom before her eyes, instead of profiting by it, went to even greater lengths in corruption than Israel. Her greater spiritual privileges made her guilt the greater (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047">Eze 16:47</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051">Eze 16:51</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#011">Jer 3:11</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012">Ezekiel 23:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">eze 23:12</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#006">Eze 23:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023">Eze 23:23</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>most gorgeously--literally, "to perfection." GROTIUS translates, "wearing a crown," or "chaplet," such as lovers wore in visiting their mistresses.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#013">Ezekiel 23:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">eze 23:13</a></font></span></p>one way--both alike forsaking God for heathen confidences.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014">Ezekiel 23:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">eze 23:14</a></font></span></p>vermilion--the peculiar color of the Chaldeans, as purple was of the Assyrians. In striking agreement with this verse is the fact that the Assyrian sculptures lately discovered have painted and colored bas-reliefs in red, blue, and black. The Jews (for instance Jehoiakim, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#014">Jer 22:14</a>) copied these (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010">Eze 8:10</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#015">Ezekiel 23:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">eze 23:15</a></font></span></p>exceeding in dyed attire--rather, "in ample dyed turbans"; literally, "redundant with dyed turbans." The Assyrians delighted in ample, flowing, and richly colored tunics, scarfs, girdles, and head-dresses or turbans, varying in ornaments according to the rank. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Chaldea, . . . land of their nativity--between the Black and Caspian Seas (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013">Isa 23:13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>princes--literally, a first-rate military class that fought by threes in the chariots, one guiding the horses, the other two fighting.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016">Ezekiel 23:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eze 23:16</a></font></span></p>sent messengers . . . into Chaldea-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#029">Eze 16:29</a>). It was she that solicited the Chaldeans, not they her. Probably the occasion was when Judah sought to strengthen herself by a Chaldean alliance against a menaced attack by Egypt (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029">Kg2 23:29-35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001">Kg2 24:1-7</a>). God made the object of their sinful desire the instrument of their punishment. Jehoiakim, probably by a stipulation of tribute, enlisted Nebuchadnezzar against Pharaoh, whose tributary he previously had been; failing to keep his stipulation, he brought on himself Nebuchadnezzar's vengeance.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017">Ezekiel 23:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">eze 23:17</a></font></span></p>alienated from them--namely, from the Chaldeans: turning again to the Egyptians (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019">Eze 23:19</a>), trying by their help to throw off her solemn engagements to Babylon (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005">Jer 37:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007">Jer 37:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018">Ezekiel 23:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">eze 23:18</a></font></span></p>my mind was alienated from her--literally, "was broken off from her." Just retribution for "her mind being alienated (broken off) from the Chaldeans" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017">Eze 23:17</a>), to whom she had sworn fealty (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012">Eze 17:12-19</a>). "Discovered" implies the open shamelessness of her apostasy.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019">Ezekiel 23:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">eze 23:19</a></font></span></p>Israel first "called" her lusts, practised when in Egypt, "to her (fond) remembrance," and then actually returned to them. Mark the danger of suffering the memory to dwell on the pleasure felt in past sins.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#020">Ezekiel 23:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">eze 23:20</a></font></span></p>their paramours--that is, her paramours among them (the Egyptians); she doted upon their persons as her paramours (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005">Eze 23:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012">Eze 23:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016">Eze 23:16</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>flesh--the membrum virile (very large in the ass). Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002">Lev 15:2</a>, Margin; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026">Eze 16:26</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>issue of horses--the seminal issue. The horse was made by the Egyptians the hieroglyphic for a lustful person.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#021">Ezekiel 23:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">eze 23:21</a></font></span></p>calledst to remembrance--"didst repeat" [MAURER].

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#022">Ezekiel 23:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">eze 23:22</a></font></span></p>lovers . . . alienated-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#017">Eze 23:17</a>). Illicit love, soon or late, ends in open hatred (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#015">Sa2 13:15</a>). The Babylonians, the objects formerly of their God-forgetting love, but now, with characteristic fickleness, objects of their hatred, shall be made by God the instruments of their punishment.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023">Ezekiel 23:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">eze 23:23</a></font></span></p>Pekod, &amp;c.-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021">Jer 50:21</a>). Not a geographical name, but descriptive of Babylon. "Visitation," peculiarly the land of "judgment"; in a double sense: actively, the inflicter of judgment on Judah; passively, as about to be afterwards herself the object of judgment. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Shoa . . . Koa--"rich . . . noble"; descriptive of Babylon in her prosperity, having all the world's wealth and dignity at her disposal. MAURER suggests that, as descriptive appellatives are subjoined to the proper name, "all the Assyrians" in the second hemistich of the verse (as the verse ought to be divided at "Koa"), so Pekod, Shoa, and Koa must be appellatives descriptive of "The Babylonians and . . . Chaldeans" in the first hemistich; "Pekod" meaning "prefects"; Shoa . . . Koa, "rich . . . princely." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>desirable young men--strong irony. Alluding to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012">Eze 23:12</a>, these "desirable young men" whom thou didst so "dote upon" for their manly vigor of appearance, shall by that very vigor be the better able to chastise thee.
 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>weels--The unusual height of these increased their formidable appearance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016">Eze 1:16-20</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>their judgments--which awarded barbarously severe punishments (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009">Jer 52:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022">Jer 29:22</a>).

Oriental beauties wore ornaments in the ear and nose. How just the retribution, that the features most bejewelled should be mutilated! So, allegorically as to Judah, the spiritual adulteress.
