 <p>
 </p><p>Isaac called Jacob and blessed him--He entered fully into Rebekah's feelings, and the burden of his parting counsel to his son was to avoid a marriage alliance with any but the Mesopotamian branch of the family. At the same time he gave him a solemn blessing--pronounced before unwittingly, now designedly, and with a cordial spirit. It is more explicitly and fully given, and Jacob was thus acknowledged "the heir of the promise."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">gen 28:6</a></font></span></p>when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, &amp;c.--Desirous to humor his parents and, if possible, get the last will revoked, he became wise when too late (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#010">Mat 25:10</a>), and hoped by gratifying his parents in one thing to atone for all his former delinquencies. But he only made bad worse, and though he did not marry a "wife of the daughters of Canaan," he married into a family which God had rejected. It showed a partial reformation, but no repentance, for he gave no proofs of abating his vindictive purposes against his brother, nor cherishing that pious spirit that would have gratified his father--he was like Micah (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#013">Jdg 17:13</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">gen 28:10</a></font></span></p>Jacob went out, &amp;c.--His departure from his father's house was an ignominious flight; and for fear of being pursued or waylaid by his vindictive brother, he did not take the common road, but went by lonely and unfrequented paths, which increased the length and dangers of the journey.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 28:11</a></font></span></p>he lighted upon a certain place--By a forced march he had reached Beth-el, about forty-eight miles from Beer-sheba, and had to spend the night in the open field. 
 <p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012">Genesis 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">gen 28:12</a></font></span></p>he dreamed . . . and behold a ladder--Some writers are of opinion that it was not a literal ladder that is meant, as it is impossible to conceive any imagery stranger and more unnatural than that of a ladder, whose base was on earth, while its top reached heaven, without having any thing on which to rest its upper extremity. They suppose that the little heap of stones, on which his head reclined for a pillow, being the miniature model of the object that appeared to his imagination, the latter was a gigantic mountain pile, whose sides, indented in the rock, gave it the appearance of a scaling ladder. There can be no doubt that this use of the original term was common among the early Hebrews; as JOSEPHUS, describing the town of Ptolemais (Acre), says it was bounded by a mountain, which, from its projecting sides, was called "the ladder," and the stairs that led down to the city are, in the original, termed a ladder (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015">Neh 3:15</a>) though they were only a flight of steps cut in the side of the rock. But whether the image presented to the mental eye of Jacob were a common ladder, or such a mountain pile as has been described, the design of this vision was to afford comfort, encouragement, and confidence to the lonely fugitive, both in his present circumstances and as to his future prospects. His thoughts during the day must have been painful--he would be his own self-accuser that he had brought exile and privation upon himself--and above all, that though he had obtained the forgiveness of his father, he had much reason to fear lest God might have forsaken him. Solitude affords time for reflection; and it was now that God began to bring Jacob under a course of religious instruction and training. To dispel his fears and allay the inward tumult of his mind, nothing was better fitted than the vision of the gigantic ladder, which reached from himself to heaven, and on which the angels were continually ascending and descending from God Himself on their benevolent errands (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051">Joh 1:51</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">gen 28:13</a></font></span></p>The Lord stood above it, and said--That Jacob might be at no loss to know the purport of the vision, he heard the divine voice; and the announcement of His name, together with a renewal of the covenant, and an assurance of personal protection, produced at once the most solemnizing and inspiriting effect on his mind.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016">Genesis 28:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 28:16</a></font></span></p>Jacob awaked out of his sleep--His language and his conduct were alike that of a man whose mind was pervaded by sentiments of solemn awe, of fervent piety, and lively gratitude (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036">Jer 31:36</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018">Genesis 28:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">gen 28:18</a></font></span></p>Jacob set up a stone, etc.--The mere setting up of the stone might have been as a future memorial to mark the spot; and this practice is still common in the East, in memory of a religious vow or engagement. But the pouring oil upon it was a consecration. Accordingly he gave it a new name, Beth-el, "the house of God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004">Hos 12:4</a>); and it will not appear a thing forced or unnatural to call a stone a house, when one considers the common practice in warm countries of sitting in the open air by or on a stone, as are those of this place, "broad sheets of bare rock, some of them standing like the cromlechs of Druidical monuments" [STANLEY].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 28:20</a></font></span></p>JACOB'S VOW. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020">Gen 28:20-22</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>Jacob vowed a vow--His words are not to be considered as implying a doubt, far less as stating the condition or terms on which he would dedicate himself to God. Let "if" be changed into "since," and the language will appear a proper expression of Jacob's faith--an evidence of his having truly embraced the promise. How edifying often to meditate on Jacob at Beth-el.
