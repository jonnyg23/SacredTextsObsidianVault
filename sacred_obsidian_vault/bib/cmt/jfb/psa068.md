 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New Testaments</i>, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 68</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001">Psalms 68:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 68:1</a></font></span></p>This is a Psalm-song (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001">Psa 30:1</a>, title), perhaps suggested by David's victories, which secured his throne and gave rest to the nation. In general terms, the judgment of God on the wicked, and the equity and goodness of His government to the pious, are celebrated. The sentiment is illustrated by examples of God's dealings, cited from the Jewish history and related in highly poetical terms. Hence the writer intimates an expectation of equal and even greater triumphs and summons all nations to unite in praises of the God of Israel. The Psalm is evidently typical of the relation which God, in the person of His Son, sustains to the Church (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psa 68:18</a>). (Psa. 68:1-35)

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 68:13</a></font></span></p>Some translate this, "When ye shall lie between the borders, ye shall," &amp;c., comparing the peaceful rest in the borders or limits of the promised land to the proverbial beauty of a gentle dove. Others understand by the word rendered "pots," the smoked sides of caves, in which the Israelites took refuge from enemies in the times of the judges; or, taking the whole figuratively, the rows of stones on which cooking vessels were hung; and thus that a contrast is drawn between their former low and afflicted state and their succeeding prosperity. In either case, a state of quiet and peace is described by a beautiful figure.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014">Psalms 68:14</a></p>

That of Bashan, northeast of Palestine, denotes a heathen nation, which is described as a "hill of God," or a great hill. Such are represented as envious of the hill (Zion) on which God resides;

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">psa 68:17</a></font></span></p>and, to the assertion of God's purpose to make it His dwelling, is added evidence of His protecting care. He is described as in the midst of His heavenly armies-- 
 <p>
 </p><p>thousands of angels--literally, "thousands of repetitions," or, "thousands of thousands"--that is, of chariots. The word "angels" was perhaps introduced in our version, from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002">Deu 33:2</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019">Gal 3:19</a>. They are, of course, implied as conductors of the chariots. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as . . . Sinai, in the holy place--that is, He has appeared in Zion as once in Sinai.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psalms 68:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">psa 68:18</a></font></span></p>From the scene of conquest He ascends to His throne, leading-- 
 <p>
 </p><p>captivity captive--or, "many captives captive" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#012">Jdg 5:12</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>received gifts for men--accepting their homage, even when forced, as that of rebels. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that the Lord God might dwell--or literally, "to dwell, O Lord God" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016">Psa 68:16</a>) --that is, to make this hill, His people or Church, His dwelling. This Psalm typifies the conquests of the Church under her divine leader, Christ. He, indeed, "who was with the Church in the wilderness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038">Act 7:38</a>) is the Lord, described in this ideal ascension. Hence Paul (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008">Eph 4:8</a>) applies this language to describe His real ascension, when, having conquered sin, death, and hell, the Lord of glory triumphantly entered heaven, attended by throngs of adoring angels, to sit on the throne and wield the scepter of an eternal dominion. The phrase "received gifts for (or literally, among) men" is by Paul, "gave gifts to men." Both describe the acts of a conqueror, who receives and distributes spoils. The Psalmist uses "receiving" as evincing the success, Paul "gave" as the act, of the conqueror, who, having subdued his enemies, proceeds to reward his friends. The special application of the passage by Paul was in proof of Christ's exaltation. What the Old Testament represents of His descending and ascending corresponds with His history. He who descended is the same who has ascended. As then ascension was an element of His triumph, so is it now; and He, who, in His humiliation, must be recognized as our vicarious sacrifice and the High Priest of our profession, must also be adored as Head of His Church and author of all her spiritual benefits.
