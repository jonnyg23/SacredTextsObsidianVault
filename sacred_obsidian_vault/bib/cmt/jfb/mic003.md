 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New Testaments</i>, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001">Micah Chapter 3</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001">Micah 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mic 3:1</a></font></span></p>THE SINS OF THE PRINCES, PROPHETS, AND PRIESTS: THE CONSEQUENT DESOLATION OF ZION. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001">Mic 3:1-12</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>princes--magistrates or judges. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Is it not for you?--Is it not your special function (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004">Jer 5:4-5</a>)? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>judgment--justice. Ye sit in judgment on others; surely then ye ought to know the judgment for injustice which awaits yourselves (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001">Rom 2:1</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002">Micah 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mic 3:2</a></font></span></p>pluck off their skin . . . flesh--rob their fellow countrymen of all their substance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004">Psa 14:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014">Pro 30:14</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003">Micah 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mic 3:3</a></font></span></p>pot . . . flesh within . . . caldron--manifold species of cruel oppressions. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003">Eze 24:3</a>, &amp;c., containing, as to the coming punishment, the same figure as is here used of the sin: implying that the sin and punishment exactly correspond.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004">Micah 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mic 3:4</a></font></span></p>Then--at the time of judgment, which Micah takes for granted, so certain is it (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003">Mic 2:3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>they cry . . . but he will not hear--just as those oppressed by them had formerly cried, and they would not hear. Their prayer shall be rejected, because it is the mere cry of nature for deliverance from pain, not that of repentance for deliverance from sin. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>ill in their doings--Men cannot expect to do ill and fare well.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005">Micah 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mic 3:5</a></font></span></p>Here he attacks the false prophets, as before he had attacked the "princes." 
 <p>
 </p><p>make my people err--knowingly mislead My people by not denouncing their sins as incurring judgment. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>bite with . . . teeth, and cry, Peace--that is, who, so long as they are supplied with food, promise peace and prosperity in their prophecies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he that putteth not into their mouths, they . . . prepare war against him--Whenever they are not supplied with food, they foretell war and calamity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>prepare war--literally, "sanctify war," that is, proclaim it as a holy judgment of God because they are not fed (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004">Jer 6:4</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003">Isa 13:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014">Joe 1:14</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006">Micah 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mic 3:6</a></font></span></p>night . . . dark--Calamities shall press on you so overwhelming as to compel you to cease pretending to divine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004">Zac 13:4</a>). Darkness is often the image of calamity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022">Isa 8:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018">Amo 5:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009">Amo 8:9</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007">Micah 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mic 3:7</a></font></span></p>cover their lips--The Orientals prided themselves on the moustache and beard ("upper lip," Margin). To cover it, therefore, was a token of shame and sorrow (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045">Lev 13:45</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017">Eze 24:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022">Eze 24:22</a>). "They shall be so ashamed of themselves as not to dare to open their mouths or boast of the name of prophet" [CALVIN]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>there is no answer of God--They shall no more profess to have responses from God, being struck dumb with calamities (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006">Mic 3:6</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008">Micah 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mic 3:8</a></font></span></p>I--in contrast to the false prophets (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005">Mic 3:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007">Mic 3:7</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>full of power--that which "the Spirit of Jehovah" imparts for the discharge of the prophetical function (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017">Luk 1:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049">Luk 24:49</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008">Act 1:8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>judgment--a sense of justice [MAURER]; as opposed to the false prophets' speaking to please men, not from a regard to truth. Or, "judgment" to discern between graver and lighter offenses, and to denounce punishments accordingly [GROTIUS]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>might--moral intrepidity in speaking the truth at all costs (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007">Ti2 1:7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to declare unto Jacob his . . . sin-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001">Isa 58:1</a>). Not to flatter the sinner as the false prophets do with promises of peace.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009">Micah 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mic 3:9</a></font></span></p>Hear--resumed from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001">Mic 3:1</a>. Here begins the leading subject of the prophecy: a demonstration of his assertion that he is "full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008">Mic 3:8</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010">Micah 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mic 3:10</a></font></span></p>They--change of person from "ye" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009">Mic 3:9</a>); the third person puts them to a greater distance as estranged from Him. It is, literally, "Whosoever builds," singular. 
 <p>
 </p><p>build up Zion with blood--build on it stately mansions with wealth obtained by the condemnation and murder of the innocent (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013">Jer 22:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027">Eze 22:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012">Hab 2:12</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011">Micah 3:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mic 3:11</a></font></span></p>heads thereof--the princes of Jerusalem. 
 <p>
 </p><p>judge for reward--take bribes as judges (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003">Mic 7:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>priests teach for hire--It was their duty to teach the law and to decide controversies gratuitously (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011">Lev 10:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011">Deu 17:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007">Mal 2:7</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013">Jer 6:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011">Jde 1:11</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>prophets . . . divine--that is, false prophets. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Is not the Lord among us?--namely in the temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002">Isa 48:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008">Jer 7:8-11</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012">Micah 3:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mic 3:12</a></font></span></p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018">Jer 26:18</a> quotes this verse. The Talmud and MAIMONIDES record that at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans under Titus, Terentius Rufus, who was left in command of the army, with a ploughshare tore up the foundations of the temple. 
 <p>
 </p><p>mountain of the house--the height on which the temple stands. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as the high places of the forest--shall become as heights in a forest overrun with wild shrubs and brushwood.
