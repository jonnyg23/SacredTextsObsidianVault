 <p>
 </p><p>Benjamin--Jerusalem was situated in the tribe of Benjamin, which was here separated from that of Judah by the valley of Hinnom. Though it was inhabited partly by Benjamites, partly by men of Judah, he addresses the former as being his own countrymen. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>blow . . . trumpet . . . Tekoa--Tikehu, Tekoa form a play on sounds. The birthplace of Amos. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Beth-haccerem--meaning in Hebrew, "vineyard-house." It and Tekoa were a few miles south of Jerusalem. As the enemy came from the north, the inhabitants of the surrounding country would naturally flee southwards. The fire-signal on the hills gave warning of danger approaching.

 </p><p>Prepare--literally, "Sanctify" war, that is, Proclaim it formally with solemn rites; the invasion was solemnly ordered by God (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003">Isa 13:3</a>). 
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>Woe unto us--The words of the invaders, mourning the approach of night which would suspend their hostile operations; still, even in spite of the darkness, at night they renew the attack (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#005">Jer 6:5</a>).

The "trees" were also used to make warlike engines. 
 <p>
 </p><p>this--pointing the invaders to Jerusalem. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>visited--that is, punished.

By a metaphor from metallurgy in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027">Jer 6:27-30</a>, Jehovah, in conclusion, confirms the prophet in his office, and the latter sums up the description of the reprobate people on whom he had to work. The Hebrew for "assayer" (English Version, "tower") is from a root "to try" metals. "Explorer" (English Version, "fortress") is from an Arabic root, "keen-sighted"; or a Hebrew root, "cutting," that is, separating the metal from the dross [EWALD]. GESENIUS translates as English Version, "fortress," which does not accord with the previous "assayer."

The prophecy given in detail here is summarily referred to there. After Josiah's death the nation relapsed into idolatry through Jehoiakim's bad influence; the worship of Jehovah was, however, combined with it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010">Jer 7:10</a>).
