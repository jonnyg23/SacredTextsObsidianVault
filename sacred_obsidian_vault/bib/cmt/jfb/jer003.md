 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 3:5</a></font></span></p>he--"thou," the second person, had preceded. The change to the third person implies a putting away of God to a greater distance from them; instead of repenting and forsaking their idols, they merely deprecate the continuance of their punishment. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012">Jer 3:12</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009">Psa 103:9</a>, answer their question in the event of their penitence.

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006">Jeremiah 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 3:6</a></font></span></p>From here to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030">Jer 6:30</a>, is a new discourse, delivered in Josiah's reign. It consists of two parts, the former extending to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003">Jer 4:3</a>, in which he warns Judah from the example of Israel's doom, and yet promises Israel final restoration; the latter a threat of Babylonian invasion; as Nabopolassar founded the Babylonian empire, 625 B.C., the seventeenth of Josiah, this prophecy is perhaps not earlier than that date (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005">Jer 4:5</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014">Jer 5:14</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001">Jer 6:1</a>, &amp;c.; Jer. 22:1-30); and probably not later than the second thorough reformation in the eighteenth year of the same reign. 
 <p>
 </p><p>backsliding--literally, "apostasy"; not merely apostate, but apostasy itself, the essence of it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014">Jer 3:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022">Jer 3:22</a>).

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008">Jeremiah 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 3:8</a></font></span></p>I saw that, though (whereas) it was for this very reason (namely), because backsliding (apostate) Israel had committed adultery I had put her away (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006">Kg2 17:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#018">Kg2 17:18</a>), and given her a bill of divorce, yet Judah, &amp;c. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#011">Eze 23:11</a>, &amp;c.). 
 <p>
 </p><p>bill of divorce--literally, "a writing of cuttings off." The plural implies the completeness of the severance. The use of this metaphor here, as in the former discourse (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001">Jer 3:1</a>), implies a close connection between the discourses. The epithets are characteristic; Israel "apostate" (as the Hebrew for "backsliding" is better rendered); Judah, not as yet utterly apostate, but treacherous or faithless. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>also--herself also, like Israel.
 </p><p>

But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010">Jer 3:10</a> puts Judah in contrast to Israel in this verse. "Yet for all this," referring to the sad example of Israel; if <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009">Jer 3:9</a> referred to Judah, "she" would have been written in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010">Jer 3:10</a>, not "Judah." Translate, "It (the putting away of Israel) had come to pass through . . . whoredom; and (that is, for) she (Israel) had defiled the land" &amp;c. [MAURER]. English Version, however, may be explained to refer to Israel. 
 <p>

 <p>
 </p><p>not . . . whole heart--The reformation in the eighteenth year of Josiah was not thorough on the part of the people, for at his death they relapsed into idolatry (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033">Ch2 34:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014">Hos 7:14</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>Return . . . backsliding--Hebrew, Shubah, Meshubah, a play on sounds. In order to excite Judah to godly jealousy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014">Rom 11:14</a>), Jehovah addresses the exiled ten tribes of Israel with a loving invitation. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cause . . . anger to fall--literally, "I will not let fall My countenance" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005">Gen 4:5-6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003">Job 29:3</a>), that is, I will not continue to frown on you.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 3:14</a></font></span></p>I am married--literally, "I am Lord," that is, husband to you (so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032">Jer 31:32</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019">Hos 2:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005">Isa 54:5</a>). GESENIUS, following the Septuagint version of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032">Jer 31:32</a>, and Paul's quotation of it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009">Heb 8:9</a>), translates, "I have rejected you"; so the corresponding Arabic, and the idea of lordship, may pass into that of looking down upon, and so rejecting. But the Septuagint in this passage translates, "I will be Lord over you." And the "for" has much more force in English Version than in that of GESENIUS. The Hebrew hardly admits the rendering though [HENGSTENBERG]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>take you one of a city--Though but one or two Israelites were in a (foreign) city, they shall not be forgotten; all shall be restored (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009">Amo 9:9</a>). So, in the spiritual Israel, God gathers one convert here, another there, into His Church; not the least one is lost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#014">Mat 18:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005">Rom 11:5</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005">Jer 24:5-7</a>).

The throne of the Lord, present Himself, shall eclipse and put out of mind the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat between the cherubim, God's former throne. The ark, containing the two tables of the law, disappeared at the Babylonian captivity, and was not restored to the second temple, implying that the symbolical "glory" was to be superseded by a "greater glory" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009">Hag 2:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>neither . . . visit it--rather, "neither shall it be missed" (so in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004">Jer 23:4</a>). 
 </p><p>

The two have never been united since the Babylonish captivity; therefore their joint restoration must be still future (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012">Isa 11:12-13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016">Eze 37:16-22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011">Hos 1:11</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>the children--that is, My children. "How shall I receive thee back into My family, after thou hast so long forsaken Me for idols?" The answer is, they would acknowledge Him as "Father," and no longer turn away from Him. God assumes the language of one wondering how so desperate apostates could be restored to His family and its privileges (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003">Eze 37:3</a>; CALVIN makes it, How the race of Abraham can be propagated again, being as it were dead); yet as His purpose has decreed it so, He shows how it shall be effected, namely, they shall receive from Him the spirit of adoption to cry, "My Father" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012">Joh 1:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006">Gal 4:6</a>). The elect are "children" already in God's purpose; this is the ground of the subsequent realization of this relationship (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005">Eph 1:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013">Heb 2:13</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>heritage of . . . hosts--a heritage the most goodly of all nations [MAURER]; or a "heritage possessed by powerful hosts" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#038">Deu 4:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009">Amo 2:9</a>). The rendering "splendors," instead of "hosts," is opposed by the fact that the Hebrew for "splendor" is not found in the plural.
