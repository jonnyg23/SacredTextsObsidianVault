Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001">Psalms Chapter 132</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001">Psalms 132:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 132:1</a></font></span></p>The writer, perhaps Solomon (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008">Psa 132:8-9</a>), after relating David's pious zeal for God's service, pleads for the fulfilment of the promise (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016">Sa2 7:16</a>), which, providing for a perpetuation of David's kingdom, involved that of God's right worship and the establishment of the greater and spiritual kingdom of David's greater Son. Of Him and His kingdom both the temple and its worship, and the kings and kingdom of Judah, were types. The congruity of such a topic with the tenor of this series of Psalms is obvious. (Psa. 132:1-18)
 <p>
 </p><p>This vow is not elsewhere recorded. It expresses, in strong language, David's intense desire to see the establishment of God's worship as well as of His kingdom. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>remember David--literally, "remember for David," that is, all his troubles and anxieties on the matter.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 132:6</a></font></span></p>These may be the "words of David" and his pious friends, who, 
 <p>
 </p><p>at Ephratah--or Beth-lehem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007">Gen 48:7</a>), where he once lived, may have heard of the ark, which he found for the first time 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the fields of the wood--or, Jair, or Kirjath-jearim ("City of woods") (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001">Sa1 7:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003">Sa2 6:3-4</a>), whence it was brought to Zion.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 132:7</a></font></span></p>The purpose of engaging in God's worship is avowed.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 132:8</a></font></span></p>The solemn entry of the ark, symbolical of God's presence and power, with the attending priests, into the sanctuary, is proclaimed in the words used by Solomon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041">Ch2 6:41</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010">Psalms 132:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 132:10</a></font></span></p>For thy servant David's sake--that is, On account of the promise made to him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>turn . . . anointed--Repulse not him who, as David's descendant, pleads the promise to perpetuate his royal line. After reciting the promise, substantially from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012">Sa2 7:12-16</a> (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030">Act 2:30</a>, &amp;c.), an additional plea,

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">psa 132:13</a></font></span></p>is made on the ground of God's choice of Zion (here used for Jerusalem) as His dwelling, inasmuch as the prosperity of the kingdom was connected with that of the Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008">Psa 122:8-9</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Psalms 132:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">psa 132:14</a></font></span></p>That choice is expressed in God's words, "I will sit" or "dwell," or sit enthroned. The joy of the people springs from the blessings of His grace, conferred through the medium of the priesthood.

With the confounding of his enemies is united his prosperity and the unceasing splendor of his crown.
