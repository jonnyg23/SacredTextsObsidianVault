 <p>
 </p><p>flying roll--of papyrus, or dressed skins, used for writing on when paper was not known. It was inscribed with the words of the curse (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015">Deu 27:15-26</a>; Deu. 28:15-68). Being written implied that its contents were beyond all escape or repeal (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009">Eze 2:9</a>). Its "flying" shows that its curses were ready swiftly to visit the transgressors. It was unrolled, or else its dimensions could not have been seen (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002">Zac 5:2</a>). Being open to all, none could say in excuse he knew not the law and the curses of disobedience. As the previous visions intimated God's favor in restoring the Jewish state, so this vision announces judgment, intimating that God, notwithstanding His favor, did not approve of their sins. Being written on both sides, "on this and on that side" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003">Zac 5:3</a>), VATABLUS connects it with the two tables of the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015">Exo 32:15</a>), and implies its comprehensiveness. One side denounced "him that sweareth falsely (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004">Zac 5:4</a>) by God's name," according to the third commandment of the first table, duty to God; the other side denounced theft, according to the eighth commandment, which is in the second table, duty to one's neighbor.

Its large size implies the great number of the curses contained. The Hebrew for "roll" or "volume" is used of the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007">Psa 40:7</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">zac 5:3</a></font></span></p>curse . . . earth-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006">Mal 4:6</a>). The Gentiles are amenable to the curse of the law, as they have its substance, so far as they have not seared and corrupted conscience, written on their hearts (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015">Rom 2:15</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>cut off--literally, "cleared away." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as on this side . . . as on that side--both sides of the roll [VATABLUS]. From this place . . . from this place (repeated twice, as "the house" is repeated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004">Zac 5:4</a>) [MAURER]; so "hence" is used, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#017">Gen 37:17</a> (or, "on this and on that side," that is, on every side) [HENDERSON]. None can escape, sin where he may: for God from one side to the other shall call all without exception to judgment [CALVIN]. God will not spare even "this place," Jerusalem, when it sins [PEMBELLUS]. English Version seems to take VATABLUS' view. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>according to it--according as it is written.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004">Zechariah 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">zac 5:4</a></font></span></p>The "theft" immediately meant is similar sacrilege to that complained of in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010">Neh 13:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008">Mal 3:8</a>. They robbed God by neglecting to give Him His due in building His house, while they built their own houses, forswearing their obligations to Him; therefore, the "houses" they build shall be "consumed" with God's "curse." Probably literal theft and perjury accompanied their virtual theft and perjury as to the temple of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005">Mal 3:5</a>). Stealing and perjury go together; for the covetous and fraudulent perjure themselves by God's name without scruple (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009">Pro 30:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>enter . . . the house--In vain they guard and shut themselves up who incur the curse; it will inevitably enter even when they think themselves most secure. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>consume . . . timber . . . stones--not leaving a vestige of it. So the "stones" and "timber" of the house of a leper (type of the sinner) were to be utterly removed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#015">Lev 14:15</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038">Kg1 18:38</a>).
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The "ephah" is the Hebrew dry measure containing about thirty-seven quarts. Alluding to the previous vision as to theft and perjury: the ephah which, by falsification of the measure, they made the instrument of defrauding, shall be made the instrument of their punishment [GROTIUS]. Compare "this is their resemblance" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006">Zac 5:6</a>), that is, this is a representation of what the Jews have done, and what they shall suffer. Their total dispersion ("the land of Shinar" being the emblem of the various Gentile lands of their present dispersion) is herein fortetold, when the measure (to which the ephah alludes) of their sins should be full. The former vision denounces judgment on individuals; this one, on the whole state: but enigmatically, not to discourage their present building [PEMBELLUS]. Rather, the vision is consolatory after the preceding one [CALVIN]. Idolatry and its kindred sins, covetousness and fraud (denounced in the vision of the roll), shall be removed far out of the Holy Land to their own congenial soil, never to return (so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009">Zac 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009">Isa 27:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001">Isa 52:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021">Isa 60:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020">Jer 50:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013">Zep 3:13</a>). For more than two thousand years, ever since the Babylonian exile, the Jews have been free from idolatry; but the full accomplishment of the prophecy is yet future, when all sin shall be purged from Israel on their return to Palestine, and conversion to Christ.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zac 5:6</a></font></span></p>This is their resemblance--literally, "eye" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004">Eze 1:4-5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016">Eze 1:16</a>). HENGSTENBERG translates, "Their (the people's) eye" was all directed to evil. But English Version is better. "This is the appearance (that is, an image) of the Jews in all the land" (not as English Version, "in all the earth"), that is, of the wicked Jews. 
 <p>
 </p><p>This--Here used of what was within the ephah, not the ephah itself.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zac 5:7</a></font></span></p>lifted up--The cover is lifted off the ephah to let the prophet see the female personification of "wickedness" within, about to be removed from Judea. The cover being "of lead," implies that the "woman" cannot escape from the ponderous load which presses her down. 
 <p>
 </p><p>talent--literally, "a round piece": hence a talent, a weight of one hundred twenty-five pounds troy. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>woman--for comparison of "wickedness" to a woman, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016">Pro 2:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003">Pro 5:3-4</a>. In personifying abstract terms, the feminine is used, as the idea of giving birth to life is associated with woman.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008">Zechariah 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zac 5:8</a></font></span></p>wickedness--literally, "the wickedness": implying wickedness in its peculiar development. Compare "the man of sin," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">Th2 2:3</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>cast it--that is, her, Wickedness, who had moved more freely while the heavy lid was partially lifted off.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009">Zechariah 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zac 5:9</a></font></span></p>The agents to carry away the "woman," are, consistently with the image, "women." God makes the wicked themselves the agents of punishing and removing wickedness. "Two" are employed, as one is not enough to carry such a load [MAURER]. Or, the Assyrians and Babylonians, who carried away idolatry in the persons, respectively, of Israel and Judah [HENDERSON]. As two "anointed ones" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014">Zac 4:14</a>) stand by the Lord as His ministers, so two winged women execute His purpose here in removing the embodiment of "wickedness": answering to the "mystery of iniquity" (the Septuagint here in Zechariah uses the same words as Paul and "the man of sin," whom the Lord shall destroy with the spirit of His mouth and the brightness of His coming, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">Th2 2:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007">Th2 2:7-8</a>). Their "wings" express velocity. The "stork" has long and wide wings, for which reason it is specified; also it is a migratory bird. The "wind" helps the rapid motion of the wings. The being "lifted up between heaven and earth" implies open execution of the judgment before the eyes of all. As the "woman" here is removed to Babylon as her own dwelling, so the woman in the Apocalypse of St. John is Babylon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003">Rev 17:3-5</a>).

Shinar--Babylonia (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010">Gen 10:10</a>), the capital of the God-opposed world kingdoms, and so representing in general the seat of irreligion. As the "building of houses" in Babylon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005">Jer 29:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028">Jer 29:28</a>) by the Jews themselves expressed their long exile there, so the building of an house for "wickedness" there implies its permanent stay. 
 <p>
 </p><p>set . . . upon her own base--fixed there as in its proper place. "Wickedness" being cast out of Judah, shall for ever dwell with the antichristian apostates (of whom Babylon is the type), who shall reap the fruit of it, which they deserve.
