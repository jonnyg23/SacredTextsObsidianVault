Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9</a></h3>

 <p>
 </p><p>a mighty man of power--that is, of great wealth and substance. The family was of high consideration in the tribe of Benjamin, and therefore Saul's words must be set down among the common forms of affected humility, which Oriental people are wont to use.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">sa1 9:2</a></font></span></p>Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly--He had a fine appearance; for it is evident that he must have been only a little under seven feet tall. A gigantic stature and an athletic frame must have been a popular recommendation at that time in that country.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">sa1 9:3</a></font></span></p>the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul . . . arise, go seek the asses--The probability is that the family of Kish, according to the immemorial usage of Oriental shepherds in the purely pastoral regions, had let the animals roam at large during the grazing season, at the close of which messengers were despatched in search of them. Such travelling searches are common; and, as each owner has his own stamp marked on his cattle, the mention of it to the shepherds he meets gradually leads to the discovery of the strayed animals. This ramble of Saul's had nothing extraordinary in it, except its superior directions and issue, which turned its uncertainty into certainty.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#004">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sa1 9:4</a></font></span></p>he passed through mount Ephraim--This being situated on the north of Benjamin, indicates the direction of Saul's journey. The district explored means the whole of the mountainous region, with its valleys and defiles, which belonged to Ephraim. Turning apparently southwards--probably through the verdant hills between Shiloh and the vales of Jordan (Shalisha and Shalim)--he approached again the borders of Benjamin, scoured the land of Zuph, and was proposing to return, when his servant recollected that they were in the immediate neighborhood of the man of God, who would give them counsel.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">sa1 9:6</a></font></span></p>there is in this city a man of God--Ramah was the usual residence of Samuel, but several circumstances, especially the mention of Rachel's sepulchre, which lay in Saul's way homeward [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002">Sa1 10:2</a>], lead to the conclusion that "this city" was not the Ramah where Samuel dwelt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>peradventure he can show us our way that we should go--It seems strange that a dignified prophet should be consulted in such an affair. But it is probable that at the introduction of the prophetic office, the seers had discovered things lost or stolen, and thus their power for higher revelations was gradually established.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">sa1 9:7</a></font></span></p>Saul said to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man?--According to Eastern notions, it would be considered a want of respect for any person to go into the presence of a superior man of rank or of official station without a present of some kind in his hand, however trifling in value. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the bread is spent in our vessels--Shepherds, going in quest of their cattle, put up in a bag as much flour for making bread as will last sometimes for thirty days. It appears that Saul thought of giving the man of God a cake from his travelling bag, and this would have been sufficient to render the indispensable act of civility--the customary tribute to official dignity.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">sa1 9:8</a></font></span></p>the fourth part of a shekel of silver--rather more than sixpence. Contrary to our Western notions, money is in the East the most acceptable form in which a present can be made to a man of rank.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">sa1 9:9</a></font></span></p>seer . . . Prophet--The recognized distinction in latter times was, that a seer was one who was favored with visions of God--a view of things invisible to mortal sight; and a prophet foretold future events.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">sa1 9:11</a></font></span></p>as they went up the hill--The modern village, Er-Rameh, lies on an eminence; and on their way they met a band of young maidens going out to the well, which, like all similar places in Palestine, was beyond the precincts of the town. From these damsels they learned that the day was devoted to a festival occasion, in honor of which Samuel had arrived in the city; that a sacrifice had been offered, which was done by prophets in extraordinary circumstances at a distance from the tabernacle, and that a feast was to follow--implying that it had been a peace offering; and that, according to the venerable practice of the Israelites, the man of God was expected to ask a special blessing on the food in a manner becoming the high occasion.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#014">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">sa1 9:14</a></font></span></p>Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place--Such were the simple manners of the times that this prophet, the chief man in Israel, was seen going to preside at a high festival undistinguished either by his dress or equipage from any ordinary citizen.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">sa1 9:15</a></font></span></p>GOD REVEALS TO SAMUEL SAUL'S COMING, AND HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE KINGDOM. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015">Sa1 9:15-27</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before--The description of Saul, the time of his arrival, and the high office to which he was destined, had been secretly intimated to Samuel from heaven. The future king of Israel was to fight the battles of the Lord and protect His people. It would appear that they were at this time suffering great molestation from the Philistines, and that this was an additional reason of their urgent demands for the appointment of a king (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005">Sa1 10:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003">Sa1 13:3</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#018">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">sa1 9:18</a></font></span></p>Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is--Satisfying the stranger's inquiry, Samuel invited him to the feast, as well as to sojourn till the morrow; and, in order to reconcile him to the delay, he assured him that the strayed asses had been recovered.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">sa1 9:20</a></font></span></p>on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?--This was a covert and indirect premonition of the royal dignity that awaited him; and, though Saul's answer shows that he fully understood it, he affected to doubt that the prophet was in earnest.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">sa1 9:21</a></font></span></p>And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, &amp;c.--By selecting a king from this least and nearly extinct tribe (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#046">Jdg 20:46-48</a>), divine wisdom designed to remove all grounds of jealousy among the other tribes.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">sa1 9:22</a></font></span></p>Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour--The toil-worn but noble-looking traveller found himself suddenly seated among the principal men of the place and treated as the most distinguished guest.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">sa1 9:24</a></font></span></p>the cook took up the shoulder . . . and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left; set it before thee, and eat--that is, reserved (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#007">Gen 18:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034">Gen 43:34</a>). This was, most probably, the right shoulder; which, as the perquisite of the sacrifice, belonged to Samuel, and which he had set aside for his expected guest. In the sculptures of the Egyptian shambles, also, the first joint taken off was always the right shoulder for the priest. The meaning of those distinguished attentions must have been understood by the other guests.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">sa1 9:25</a></font></span></p>Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house--Saul was taken to lodge with the prophet for that night. Before retiring to rest, they communed on the flat roof of the house, the couch being laid there (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006">Jos 2:6</a>), when, doubtless, Samuel revealed the secret and described the peculiar duties of a monarch in a nation so related to the Divine King as Israel. Next morning early, Samuel roused his guest, and conveying him on his way towards the skirts of the city, sought, before parting, a private interview--the object of which is narrated in the next chapter.
