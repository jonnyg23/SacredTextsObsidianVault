 <p>
 </p><p>the rulers . . . dwelt at Jerusalem--That city being the metropolis of the country, it was right and proper that the seat of government should be there. But the exigency of the times required that special measures should be taken to insure the residence of an adequate population for the custody of the buildings and the defense of the city. From the annoyances of restless and malignant enemies, who tried every means to demolish the rising fortifications, there was some danger attending a settlement in Jerusalem. Hence the greater part of the returned exiles, in order to earn as well as secure the rewards of their duty, preferred to remain in the country or the provincial towns. To remedy this state of things, it was resolved to select every tenth man of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin by lot, to become a permanent inhabitant of the capital. The necessity of such an expedient commended it to the general approval. It was the more readily submitted to because the lot was resorted to on all the most critical conjunctures of the Jewish history, and regarded by the people as a divine decision (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018">Pro 18:18</a>). This awakened strongly the national spirit; and patriotic volunteers came forward readily to meet the wishes of the authorities, a service which, implying great self-denial as well as courage, was reckoned in the circumstances of so much importance as entitled them to the public gratitude. No wonder that the conduct of these volunteers drew forth the tribute of public admiration; for they sacrificed their personal safety and comfort for the interests of the community because Jerusalem was at that time a place against which the enemies of the Jews were directing a thousand plots. Therefore, residence in it at such a juncture was attended with expense and various annoyances from which a country life was entirely free.

 <p>
 </p><p>the chief of the province--that is, Judea. Nehemiah speaks of it, as it then was, a small appendix of the Persian empire. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities--The returned exiles, who had come from Babylon, repaired generally, and by a natural impulse, to the lands and cities throughout the country which had been anciently assigned them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Israel--This general name, which designated the descendants of Jacob before the unhappy division of the two kingdoms under Rehoboam, was restored after the captivity, the Israelites being then united with the Jews, and all traces of their former separation being obliterated. Although the majority of the returned exiles belonged to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, they are here called Israel because a large number out of all the tribes were now intermingled, and these were principally the occupiers of the rural villages, while none but those of Judah and Benjamin resided in Jerusalem. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the Levites--These took possession of the cities allotted to them according as they had opportunity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the Nethinims--A certain order of men, either Gibeonites or persons joined with them, who were devoted to the service of God.
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">neh 11:4</a></font></span></p>at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah--The discrepancy that is apparent between this [Neh. 11:4-36] and the list formerly given in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001">Ch1 9:1-9</a>, arose not only from the Jewish and Oriental practice of changing or modifying the names of persons from a change of circumstances, but from the alterations that must have been produced in the course of time. The catalogue in Chronicles contains those who came with the first detachment of returned exiles, while the list in this passage probably included also those who returned with Ezra and Nehemiah; or it was most probably made out afterwards, when several had died, or some, who had been inserted as going on the journey, remained, and others came in their stead.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">neh 11:16</a></font></span></p>the oversight of the outward business of the house of God--that is, those things which were done outside, or in the country, such as the collecting of the provisions (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#029">Ch1 26:29</a>).

That service was always accompanied by some appropriate psalm, the sacred music being selected and guided by the person named.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022">Nehemiah 11:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">neh 11:22</a></font></span></p>the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God--They were selected to take charge of providing those things which were required for the interior of the temple and its service, while to others was committed the care of the "outward business of the house of God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016">Neh 11:16</a>). This duty was very properly assigned to the sons of Asaph; for, though they were Levites, they did not repair in rotation to Jerusalem, as the other ministers of religion. Being permanent residents, and employed in duties which were comparatively light and easy, they were very competent to undertake this charge.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">neh 11:23</a></font></span></p>it was the king's commandment--It was the will of the Persian monarch in issuing his edict that the temple service should be revived in all its religious fulness and solemnity. As this special provision for the singers is said to have been by the king's commandment, the order was probably given at the request or suggestion of Ezra or Nehemiah.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">neh 11:36</a></font></span></p>And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin--Rather, there were divisions for the Levites; that is, those who were not resident in Jerusalem were distributed in settlements throughout the provinces of Judah and Benjamin.
