Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001">Isaiah Chapter 44</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001">Isaiah 44:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 44:1</a></font></span></p>CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER. (Isa. 44:1-28)
 <p>
 </p><p>Yet--Though thou hast sinned, yet hear God's gracious promise as to thy deliverance. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>chosen-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008">Isa 41:8</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002">Isaiah 44:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 44:2</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001">Isa 43:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007">Isa 43:7</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>formed . . . from . . . womb--(So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024">Isa 44:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001">Isa 49:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005">Isa 49:5</a>). The sense is similar to that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002">Isa 1:2</a>, "I have nourished and brought up children." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Jesurun--A diminutive term of endearment applied to Israel. The full title of affection was Israelun; contracted it became Jeshurun, with an allusion to the Hebrew root, jashar, "upright," "perfect" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019">Isa 42:19</a>, note on "He that is perfect") [GESENIUS], (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015">Deu 32:15</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 44:3</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018">Isa 41:18</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>him . . . thirsty--rather, "the land" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006">Isa 35:6-7</a>), figuratively for man thirsting after righteousness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006">Mat 5:6</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>floods--the abundant influences of the Holy Spirit, stronger than "water." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>spirit--including all spiritual and temporal gifts, as the parallel, "blessing," proves (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002">Isa 11:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015">Isa 32:15</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>seed-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021">Isa 59:21</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004">Isaiah 44:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 44:4</a></font></span></p>they--thy "seed" and "offspring" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003">Isa 44:3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>as among--needlessly inserted in English Version. Rather, "The seed shall spring up as willows among the grass beside canals of water" [HORSLEY]. Or, "They shall spring up among the grass (that is, luxuriantly; for what grows in the midst of grass grows luxuriantly) as willows by the water-courses," which makes the parallel clauses better balanced [MAURER].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005">Isaiah 44:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 44:5</a></font></span></p>The third clause answers in parallelism to the first, the fourth to the second. 
 <p>
 </p><p>I am the Lord's-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005">Jer 50:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019">Co1 6:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005">Co2 8:5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>call himself by the name of Jacob--The Gentiles (as the result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Israel, the Lord's "seed," first) shall join themselves to the children of Jacob, in order to worship their God (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007">Isa 43:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011">Psa 49:11</a>). Or, "calls," that is, invokes and celebrates the name of Jacob, attaches himself to his nation and religion [MAURER], (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006">Psa 24:6</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>subscribe . . . hand unto . . . Lord--in solemn and public covenant, pledging himself to God's service (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038">Neh 9:38</a>), before "witnesses" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001">Heb 12:1</a>), after the manner of a civil contract (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#010">Jer 32:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012">Jer 32:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044">Jer 32:44</a>). So the Christian in the sacraments [BARNES]. Literally, "shall fill his hand with letters (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015">Exo 32:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010">Eze 2:10</a>) in honor of Jehovah"; or "shall write upon his hand, I am Jehovah's" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016">Isa 49:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016">Rev 13:16</a>); alluding to the puncture with ink on the hand, whereby a soldier marked himself as bound to his commander; and whereby the Christians used to mark themselves with the name of Christ [LOWTH]. The former view is simpler. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>surname himself . . . Israel--MAURER and GESENIUS interpret this as the Hebrew sanctions, answering to their rendering of the parallel second clause, "calls blandly (speaks in honorable terms of) the name of Israel." Retaining English Version, we must, from the Hebrew understand it thus, "Surname himself by the honorable name of Israel" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004">Isa 45:4</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006">Isaiah 44:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 44:6</a></font></span></p>Here follows an argument for Jehovah, as the only God, and against the idols, as vanity (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004">Isa 41:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001">Isa 43:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010">Isa 43:10-12</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007">Isaiah 44:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 44:7</a></font></span></p>Who but God can predict future events and declare also the order and time of each (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022">Isa 41:22-23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021">Isa 45:21</a>)? 
 <p>
 </p><p>call--"openly proclaim" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006">Isa 40:6</a>) things to come [MAURER]. Or, "call forth" the event; command that it happen (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011">Isa 46:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#015">Isa 48:15</a>), [BARNES]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>set . . . in order--There is no chance or confusion; all events occur in the order best fitted to subserve God's plans. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for me--It is FOR GOD that all things exist and take place (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011">Rev 4:11</a>). But MAURER translates, "Let him set it forth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019">Job 37:19</a>) to me." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>since . . . ancient people--I have given the Jews predictions of the future ever since I appointed them as My people in ancient times; therefore they were qualified to be His witnesses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008">Isa 44:8</a>). As to their being God's "ancient (everlasting) people," see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#007">Deu 32:7-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003">Jer 31:3</a>; the type of the redeemed Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008">Isaiah 44:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 44:8</a></font></span></p>be afraid--literally, "be astounded," or "distracted with fear." 
 <p>
 </p><p>from that time--namely, from the time that "I appointed the ancient people" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007">Isa 44:7</a>). From the time of Abraham's call, his family were the depositories of the predictions of the Redeemer, whereas the promise of Cyrus was not heard of till Isaiah's time; therefore, the event to the prediction and accomplishment of which God appeals in proof of His sole Godhead, is the redemption of man by a descendant of Abraham, in whose person "the ancient people" was first formally "appointed." The deliverance of the Jews, by Cyrus, is mentioned afterwards only as an earnest of that greater mercy [HORSLEY]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>no God--Hebrew, tsur, "rock" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004">Deu 32:4</a>); that is, a stronghold to take refuge in, and a solid foundation to build on.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009">Isaiah 44:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 44:9</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018">Isa 40:18</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#020">Isa 40:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029">Isa 41:29</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>delectable things--the idols in which they take such pride and delight. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>not profit-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018">Hab 2:18</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>they are their own witnesses--contrasted with, "Ye are My witnesses" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008">Isa 44:8</a>). "They," that is, both the makers and the idols, are witnesses against themselves, for the idols palpably see and know nothing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004">Psa 115:4-8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that they may be ashamed--the consequence deducible from the whole previous argument, not merely from the words immediately preceding, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013">Isa 28:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#012">Isa 36:12</a>. I say all this to show that they are doomed to perish with shame, which is their only fitting end.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#010">Isaiah 44:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 44:10</a></font></span></p>Who . . . ?--Sarcastic question: "How debased the man must be who forms a god!" It is a contradiction in terms. A made god, worshipped by its maker (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004">Co1 8:4</a>)!
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#011">Isaiah 44:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 44:11</a></font></span></p>his fellows--the associates of him who makes an idol; or of the idol (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026">Deu 7:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008">Psa 115:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017">Hos 4:17</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>they are of men--They are mortal men themselves; what better, then, can the idol be than its maker? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>gathered together . . . stand up--as in a court of justice, to try the issue between God and them (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001">Isa 41:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021">Isa 41:21</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>yet--wrongly inserted in English Version. The issue of the trial shall be, "they shall fear," &amp;c.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#012">Isaiah 44:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 44:12</a></font></span></p>tongs--rather, "prepareth (to be supplied) an axe," namely, with which to cut down the tree designed as the material of the idol. The "smith" (Hebrew, "workman in iron") here answers to the "carpenter" (Hebrew, "workman in wood"). "He worketh it (the axe, not the idol, which was wood, not metal) in the coals," &amp;c. The axe was wrought, not cast. The smith makes the axe for the carpenter. 
 <p>
 </p><p>hungry . . . drinketh no water--so eager is he to expedite his work while the iron is hot. If the god were worth anything, it would not let him grow "faint" with hunger and thirst. Williams, the missionary, states that the South Sea islanders when they make an idol abstain from food and drink.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#013">Isaiah 44:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 44:13</a></font></span></p>After the smith's work in preparing the instruments comes the carpenter's work in forming the idol. 
 <p>
 </p><p>rule--rather, "line" [BARNES]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>with a line--rather, a "pencil," [HORSLEY]. Literally, "red ochre," which he uses to mark on the wood the outline of the figure [LOWTH]. Or best, the stylus or graver, with which the incision of the outline is made [GESENIUS]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>planes--rather, "chisels" or "carving tools," for a plane would not answer for carving. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>compass--from a Hebrew root, "to make a circle"; by it, symmetry of form is secured. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>according to . . . beauty of a man--irony. The highest idea the heathen could form of a god was one of a form like their own. JEROME says, "The more handsome the statue the more august the god was thought." The incarnation of the Son of God condescends to this anthropomorphic feeling so natural to man, but in such a way as to raise man's thoughts up to the infinite God who "is a spirit." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that it may remain in . . . house--the only thing it was good for; it could not hear nor save (compare Wisdom 13:15).

 <p>
 </p><p>cypress--rather, from Hebrew root, "to be hard," the holm oak," an evergreen abundant in Palestine [GESENIUS]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>strengtheneth--literally, "and he getteth strength to himself in the trees of the forest;" that is, he layeth in a great store of timber [LOWTH]. Or, "chooseth," as "madest strong for thyself," that is, hast chosen (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015">Psa 80:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017">Psa 80:17</a>) [GESENIUS]. But English Version gives a good sense: "strengtheneth"; that is, rears to maturity; a meaning suitable also to the context of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015">Psa 80:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017">Psa 80:17</a>, where Israel is compared to a vine planted by Jehovah [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>rain doth nourish it--Though the man planted the tree, yet he could not make it grow. In preparing to make an idol, he has to depend on the true God for rain from heaven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022">Jer 14:22</a>).

There is an allusion, perhaps, also, to the god being made of a tree, the half of which was reduced to ashes by fire (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#015">Isa 44:15-17</a>); the idol, it is implied, was no better, and could, and ought, to have been reduced to ashes like the other half.

Not only the "thick cloud" of the heavier "transgressions," but the "cloud" ("vapor" [LOWTH], not so dense, but covering the sky as a mist) of the countless "sins." These latter, though not thought much of by man, need, as much as the former, to be cleared away by the Sun of righteousness; else they will be a mist separating us from heaven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012">Psa 19:12-13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007">Jo1 1:7-9</a>).

This is the first time Cyrus is named expressly; and that, a hundred fifty years before the time when in 550 B.C. he began his reign. The name comes from the Persian khorschid, "the sun"; kings often taking their names from the gods; the sun was worshipped as a god in Persia.

Cyrus, according to JOSEPHUS, heard of this prophecy of Isaiah delivered so long before; hence he was induced to do that which was so contrary to Oriental policy, to aid in restoring the captive Jews and rebuilding their temple and city.
