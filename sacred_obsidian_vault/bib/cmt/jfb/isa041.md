(Isa. 41:1-29)
 <p>
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013">Zac 2:13</a>). God is about to argue the case; therefore let the nations listen in reverential silence. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016">Gen 28:16-17</a>, as to the spirit in which we ought to behave before God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>before me--rather (turning), "towards me" [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>islands--including all regions beyond sea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022">Jer 25:22</a>), maritime regions, not merely isles in the strict sense. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>renew . . . strength--Let them gather their strength for the argument; let them adduce their strongest arguments (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018">Isa 1:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032">Job 9:32</a>). "Judgment" means here, to decide the point at issue between us.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002">Isaiah 41:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 41:2</a></font></span></p>Who--else but God? The fact that God "raiseth up" Cyrus and qualifies him for becoming the conqueror of the nations and deliverer of God's people, is a strong argument why they should trust in Him. The future is here prophetically represented as present or past. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the righteous man--Cyrus; as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isa 45:1-4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isa 45:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011">Isa 46:11</a>, "from the East," prove. Called "righteous," not so much on account of his own equity [HERODOTUS, 3.89], as because he fulfilled God's righteous will in restoring the Jews from their unjust captivity. Raised him up in righteousness. The Septuagint takes the Hebrew as a noun "righteousness." MAURER translates, "Who raised up him whom salvation (national and temporal, the gift of God's 'righteousness' to the good, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017">Isa 32:17</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008">Isa 45:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005">Isa 51:5</a>) meets at his foot" (that is, wherever he goes). Cyrus is said to come from the East, because Persia is east of Babylon; but in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025">Isa 41:25</a>, from the north, in reference to Media. At the same time the full sense of righteousness, or righteous, and of the whole passage, is realized only in Messiah, Cyrus' antitype (Cyrus knew not God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004">Isa 45:4</a>). He goes forth as the Universal Conqueror of the "nations," in righteousness making war (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008">Psa 2:8-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11-15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002">Rev 6:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026">Rev 2:26-27</a>). "The idols He shall utterly abolish" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023">Isa 7:23</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018">Isa 2:18</a>). Righteousness was always raised up from the East. Paradise was east of Eden. The cherubim were at the east of the garden. Abraham was called from the East. Judea, the birthplace of Messiah, was in the East. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>called . . . to . . . foot--called him to attend His (God's) steps, that is, follow His guidance. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002">Ezr 1:2</a>, Cyrus acknowledges Jehovah as the Giver of his victories. He subdued the nations from the Euxine to the Red Sea, and even Egypt (says XENOPHON). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>dust-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013">Isa 17:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005">Isa 29:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042">Psa 18:42</a>). Persia, Cyrus' country, was famed for the use of the "bow" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006">Isa 22:6</a>). "Before him" means "gave them into his power" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012">Jos 10:12</a>). MAURER translates, "Gave his (the enemy's) sword to be dust, and his (the enemy's) bow to be as stubble" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026">Job 41:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#029">Job 41:29</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 41:3</a></font></span></p>Cyrus had not visited the regions of the Euphrates and westward until he visited them for conquest. So the gospel conquests penetrated regions where the name of God was unknown before.

 </p><p>

God's people are as 'worms' in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, or of the serpent's seed." [HENRY]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>men--The parallelism requires the word "men" here to have associated with it the idea of fewness or feebleness. LOWTH translates, "Ye mortals of Israel." The Septuagint, "altogether diminutive." MAURER supports English Version, which the Hebrew text best accord with. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the Lord--in general.

The language is so constructed as only very partially to apply to the local and temporary event of the restoration from Babylon; but fully to be realized in the waters of life and of the Spirit, under the Gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025">Isa 30:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003">Isa 44:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037">Joh 7:37-39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014">Joh 4:14</a>).

 <p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>oil tree--the olive.

BARNES explains it more reconditely, "Let them foretell the entire series of events, showing, in their order, the things which shall first occur, as well as those which shall finally happen"; the false prophets tried to predict isolated events, having no mutual dependency; not a long series of events mutually and orderly connected, and stretching far into futurity. They did not even try to do this. None but God can do it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010">Isa 46:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007">Isa 44:7-8</a>). "Or . . . things to come" will, in this view, mean, Let them, if they cannot predict the series, even predict plainly any detached events.
