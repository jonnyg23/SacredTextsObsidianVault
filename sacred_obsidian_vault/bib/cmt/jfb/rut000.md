Although it relates an episode belonging to the time of the Judges, its precise date is unknown. It appears certain, however, that it could not have been written prior to the time of Samuel (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017">Rut 4:17-22</a>), who is generally supposed to have been its author; and this opinion, in addition to other reasons on which it rests, is confirmed by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007">Rut 4:7</a>, where it is evident that the history was not compiled till long after the transactions recorded. The inspiration and canonical authority of the book is attested by the fact of Ruth's name being inserted by Matthew in the Saviour's genealogy [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</a>].
