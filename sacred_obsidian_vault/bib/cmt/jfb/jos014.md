 <p>
 </p><p>these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan--This chapter forms the introduction to an account of the allocation of the land west of Jordan, or Canaan proper, to the nine tribes and a half. It was also made by lot in presence of a select number of superintendents, appointed according to divine directions given to Moses (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016">Num 34:16</a>). In everything pertaining to civil government, and even the division of the land, Joshua was the acknowledged chief. But in a matter to be determined by lot, a solemn appeal was made to God, and hence Eleazar, as high priest, is named before Joshua.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jos 14:4</a></font></span></p>The children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim--As two and a half tribes were settled on the east Jordan, and the Levites had no inheritance assigned them in land, there would have been only eight and a half tribes to provide for. But Ephraim and Manasseh, the two sons of Joseph, had been constituted two tribes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005">Gen 48:5</a>), and although Levi was excluded, the original number of the tribes of Israel was still preserved.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jos 14:5</a></font></span></p>the children of Israel . . . divided the land--that is, they made the preliminary arrangements for the work. A considerable time was requisite for the survey and measurement.

 <p>
 </p><p>Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb . . . said--This incident is recorded here because it occurred while the preparations were being made for casting the lots, which, it appears, were begun in Gilgal. The claim of Caleb to the mountains of Hebron as his personal and family possessions was founded on a solemn promise of Moses, forty-five years before (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024">Num 14:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036">Deu 1:36</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010">Jos 14:10</a>), to give him that land on account of his fidelity. Being one of the nominees appointed to preside over the division of the country, he might have been charged with using his powers as a commissioner to his own advantage, had he urged his request in private; and therefore he took some of his brethren along with him as witness of the justice and propriety of his conduct.

 <p>
 </p><p>for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there--The report of the spies, who tried to kindle the flame of sedition and discontent, related chiefly to the people and condition of this mountain district, and hence it was promised as the reward of Caleb's truth, piety, and faithfulness.
