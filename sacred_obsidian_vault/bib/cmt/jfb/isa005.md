 <p>
 </p><p>to--rather, "concerning" [GESENIUS], that is, in the person of My beloved, as His representative [VITRINGA]. Isaiah gives a hint of the distinction and yet unity of the Divine Persons (compare He with I, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002">Isa 5:2-3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>of my beloved--inspired by Him; or else, a tender song [CASTALIO]. By a slight change of reading "a song of His love" [HOUBIGANT]. "The Beloved" is Jehovah, the Second Person, the "Angel" of God the Father, not in His character as incarnate Messiah, but as God of the Jews (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020">Exo 23:20-21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034">Exo 32:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014">Exo 33:14</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>vineyard-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014">Isa 3:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008">Psa 80:8</a>, &amp;c.). The Jewish covenant-people, separated from the nations for His glory, as the object of His peculiar care (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001">Mat 20:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033">Mat 21:33</a>). Jesus Christ in the "vineyard" of the New Testament Church is the same as the Old Testament Angel of the Jewish covenant. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>fruitful hill--literally, "a horn" ("peak," as the Swiss shreckhorn) of the son of oil; poetically, for very fruitful. Suggestive of isolation, security, and a sunny aspect. Isaiah alludes plainly to the Song of Solomon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003">Sol 6:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011">Sol 8:11-12</a>), in the words "His vineyard" and "my Beloved" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020">Isa 26:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010">Isa 61:10</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004">Sol 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010">Sol 4:10</a>). The transition from "branch" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002">Isa 4:2</a>) to "vineyard" here is not unnatural.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002">Isaiah 5:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 5:2</a></font></span></p>fenced--rather, "digged and trenched" the ground to prepare it for planting the vines [MAURER]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>choicest vine--Hebrew, sorek; called still in Morocco, serki; the grapes had scarcely perceptible seeds; the Persian kishmish or bedana, that is, "without seed" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011">Gen 49:11</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>tower--to watch the vineyard against the depredations of man or beast, and for the use of the owner (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033">Mat 21:33</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wine-press--including the wine-fat; both hewn, for coolness, out of the rocky undersoil of the vineyard. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wild grapes--The Hebrew expresses offensive putrefaction, answering to the corrupt state of the Jews. Fetid fruit of the wild vine [MAURER], instead of "choicest" grapes. Of the poisonous monk's hood [GESENIUS]. The Arabs call the fruit of the nightshade "wolf grapes" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032">Deu 32:32-33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039">Kg2 4:39-41</a>). JEROME tries to specify the details of the parable; the "fence," angels; the "stones gathered out," idols; the "tower," the "temple in the midst" of Judea; the "wine-press," the altar.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003">Isaiah 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 5:3</a></font></span></p>And now, &amp;c.--appeal of God to themselves, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018">Isa 1:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003">Mic 6:3</a>. So Jesus Christ, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040">Mat 21:40-41</a>, alluding in the very form of expression to this, makes them pass sentence on themselves. God condemns sinners "out of their own mouth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006">Deu 32:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#006">Job 15:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#022">Luk 19:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004">Rom 3:4</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004">Isaiah 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 5:4</a></font></span></p>God has done all that could be done for the salvation of sinners, consistently with His justice and goodness. The God of nature is, as it were, amazed at the unnatural fruit of so well-cared a vineyard.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005">Isaiah 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 5:5</a></font></span></p>go to--that is, attend to me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>hedge . . . wall--It had both; a proof of the care of the owner. But now it shall be trodden down by wild beasts (enemies) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012">Psa 80:12-13</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006">Isaiah 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 5:6</a></font></span></p>I will . . . command--The parable is partly dropped and Jehovah, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007">Isa 5:7</a>, is implied to be the Owner: for He alone, not an ordinary husbandman (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043">Mat 21:43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022">Luk 17:22</a>), could give such a "command." 
 <p>
 </p><p>no rain--antitypically, the heaven-sent teachings of the prophets (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011">Amo 8:11</a>). Not accomplished in the Babylonish captivity; for Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai, and Zechariah prophesied during or after it. But in gospel times.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007">Isaiah 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 5:7</a></font></span></p>Isaiah here applies the parable. It is no mere human owner, nor a literal vineyard that is meant. 
 <p>
 </p><p>vineyard of the Lord--His only one (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005">Exo 19:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002">Amo 3:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>pleasant--"the plant of his delight"; just as the husbandman was at pains to select the sorek, or "choicest vine" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002">Isa 5:2</a>); so God's election of the Jews. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>judgment--justice. The play upon words is striking in the Hebrew, He looked for mishpat, but behold mispat ("bloodshed"); for tsedaqua, but behold tseaqua (the cry that attends anarchy, covetousness, and dissipation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008">Isa 5:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011">Isa 5:11-12</a>; compare the cry of the rabble by which justice was overborne in the case of Jesus Christ, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#023">Mat 27:23-24</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>till there be no place--left for any one else. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that they may be--rather, and ye be. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>great and fair--houses.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>bath--of wine; seven and a half gallons. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>homer . . . ephah--Eight bushels of seed would yield only three pecks of produce (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011">Eze 45:11</a>). The ephah and bath, one-tenth of an homer.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>strong drink--Hebrew, sichar, implying intoxication.

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012">Isaiah 5:12</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>viol--an instrument with twelve strings [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.10]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>tabret--Hebrew, toph, from the use of which in drowning the cries of children sacrificed to Moloch, Tophet received its name. Arabic, duf. A kettle drum, or tambourine. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>pipe--flute or flageolet: from a Hebrew root "to bore through"; or else, "to dance" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011">Job 21:11-15</a>). 
 </p><p>

Not here, "the place of torment." Poetically, it is represented as enlarging itself immensely, in order to receive the countless hosts of Jews, which should perish (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030">Num 16:30</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>their--that is, of the Jewish people. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he that rejoiceth--the drunken reveller in Jerusalem.
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">isa 5:15</a></font></span></p>(Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009">Isa 2:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011">Isa 2:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017">Isa 2:17</a>). All ranks, "mean" and "mighty" alike; so "honorable" and "multitude" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013">Isa 5:13</a>).

Otherwise, as in their own pasture [GESENIUS]: so the Hebrew in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012">Mic 2:12</a>. The lands of the Scenite tent dwellers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007">Jer 35:7</a>). Arab shepherds in the neighborhood shall roam at large, the whole of Judea being so desolate as to become a vast pasturage. 
 <p>
 </p><p>waste . . . fat ones--the deserted lands of the rich ("fat," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029">Psa 22:29</a>), then gone into captivity; "strangers," that is, nomad tribes shall make their flocks to feed on [MAURER]. Figuratively, "the lambs" are the pious, "the fat ones" the impious. So tender disciples of Jesus Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015">Joh 21:15</a>) are called "lambs"; being meek, harmless, poor, and persecuted. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018">Eze 39:18</a>, where the fatlings are the rich and great (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026">Co1 1:26-27</a>). The "strangers" are in this view the "other sheep not of the" the Jewish "fold" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016">Joh 10:16</a>), the Gentiles whom Jesus Christ shall "bring" to be partakers of the rich privileges (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017">Rom 11:17</a>) which the Jews ("fat ones," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016">Eze 34:16</a>) fell from. Thus "after their (own) manner" will express that the Christian Church should worship God in freedom, released from legal bondage (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023">Joh 4:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001">Gal 5:1</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>iniquity--guilt, incurring punishment [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cords, &amp;c.--cart-rope--Rabbins say, "An evil inclination is at first like a fine hair-string, but the finishing like a cart-rope." The antithesis is between the slender cords of sophistry, like the spider's web (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005">Isa 59:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014">Job 8:14</a>), with which one sin draws on another, until they at last bind themselves with great guilt as with a cart-rope. They strain every nerve in sin.

 <p>
 </p><p>hills . . . tremble--This probably fixes the date of this chapter, as it refers to the earthquake in the days of Uzziah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001">Amo 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005">Zac 14:5</a>).

 </p><p>For all this, &amp;c.--This burden of the prophet's strains, with dirge-like monotony, is repeated at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012">Isa 9:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017">Isa 9:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#021">Isa 9:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004">Isa 10:4</a>. With all the past calamities, still heavier judgments are impending; which he specifies in the rest of the chapter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014">Lev 26:14</a>, &amp;c.).

But for mercy to it, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012">Isa 11:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003">Isa 18:3</a>.

Bees were drawn out of their hives by the sound of a flute, or hissing, or whistling (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008">Zac 10:8</a>). God will collect the nations round Judea like bees (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044">Deu 1:44</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012">Psa 118:12</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>end of the earth--the widely distant subject races of which the Assyrian army was made up (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006">Isa 22:6</a>). The ulterior fulfilment took place in the siege under Roman Titus. Compare "end of the earth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049">Deu 28:49</a>, &amp;c.). So the pronoun is singular in the Hebrew, for "them," "their," "whose" (him, his, &amp;c.), <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026">Isa 5:26-29</a>; referring to some particular nation and person [HORSLEY].

 </p><p>
 </p><p>girdle--with which the ancient loose robes used to be girded for action. Ever ready for march or battle. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p>hoofs . . . flint--The ancients did not shoe their horses: hence the value of hard hoofs for long marches. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wheels--of their chariots. The Assyrian army abounded in cavalry and chariots (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006">Isa 22:6-7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#008">Isa 36:8</a>).

[MAURER]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>heavens--literally, "clouds," that is, its sky is rather "clouds" than sky. Otherwise from a different Hebrew root, "in its destruction" or ruins. HORSLEY takes "sea . . . look unto the land" as a new image taken from mariners in a coasting vessel (such as all ancient vessels were), looking for the nearest land, which the darkness of the storm conceals, so that darkness and distress alone may be said to be visible.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Isaiah is outside, near the altar in front of the temple. The doors are supposed to open, and the veil hiding the Holy of Holies to be withdrawn, unfolding to his view a vision of God represented as an Eastern monarch, attended by seraphim as His ministers of state (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019">Kg1 22:19</a>), and with a robe and flowing train (a badge of dignity in the East), which filled the temple. This assertion that he had seen God was, according to tradition (not sanctioned by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001">Isa 1:1</a>; see Introduction), the pretext for sawing him asunder in Manasseh's reign (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037">Heb 11:37</a>). Visions often occur in the other prophets: in Isaiah there is only this one, and it is marked by characteristic clearness and simplicity.
