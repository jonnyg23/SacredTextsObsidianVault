 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 10:5</a></font></span></p>It was written when Assyria proposed (a design which it soon after tried to carry out under Sennacherib) to destroy Judah and Jerusalem, as it had destroyed Samaria. This is the first part of Isaiah's prophecies under Hezekiah. Probably between 722 and 715 B.C. (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027">Isa 10:27</a>). (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009">Isa 10:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011">Isa 10:11</a> show that Samaria was destroyed before this prophecy)
 <p>
 </p><p>O Assyrian, &amp;c.--rather, "What, ho (but MAURER, Woe to the) Assyrian! He is the rod and staff of Mine anger (My instrument in punishing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020">Jer 51:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013">Psa 17:13</a>). In their hands is Mine indignation" [HORSLEY, after JEROME]. I have put into the Assyrians' hands the execution of Mine indignation against My people.

 <p>
 </p><p>hypocritical--polluted [HORSLEY]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>nation--Judah, against whom Sennacherib was forming designs.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>give . . . charge-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022">Jer 34:22</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and to tread, &amp;c.--HORSLEY translates: "And then to make him (the Assyrian) a trampling under foot like the mire of the streets" (so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012">Isa 10:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001">Isa 33:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005">Zac 10:5</a>).

 <p>

Sinners' plans are no less culpable, though they by them unconsciously fulfil God's designs (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010">Psa 76:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012">Mic 4:12</a>). So Joseph's brethren (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#020">Gen 50:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004">Pro 16:4</a>). The sinner's motive, not the result (which depends on God), will be the test in judgment. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>heart to destroy . . . not a few--Sennacherib's ambition was not confined to Judea. His plan was also to conquer Egypt and Ethiopia (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isa 20:1-6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015">Zac 1:15</a>).

Hence the title, "King of kings," implying the greatness of Him who was over them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007">Eze 26:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012">Ezr 7:12</a>).

 </p><p>Calno--Calneh, built by Nimrod (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010">Gen 10:10</a>), once his capital, on the Tigris.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>Hamath--in Syria, north of Canaan (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018">Gen 10:18</a>). Taken by Assyria about 753 B.C. From it colonists were planted by Assyria in Samaria.

He regards Jerusalem as idolatrous, an opinion which it often had given too much ground for: Jehovah was in his view the mere local god of Judea, as Baal of the countries where it was adored, nay, inferior in power to some national gods (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#019">Isa 36:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012">Isa 37:12</a>).

 </p><p>staff . . . lift . . . itself . . . no wood--rather, "as if the staff (man, the instrument of God's judgments on his fellow man) should set aside (Him who is) not wood" (not a mere instrument, as man). On "no wood" compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021">Deu 32:21</a>, "that which is not God;" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008">Isa 31:8</a> shows that God is meant here by "not wood" [MAURER].

Compare "leanness," that is, wasting destruction (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016">Isa 10:16</a>) [MAURER].

 </p><p>From the local and temporary national deliverance the prophet passes by the law of suggestion in an easy transition to the end of all prophecy--the everlasting deliverance under Messiah's reign, not merely His first coming, but chiefly His second coming. The language and illustrations are still drawn from the temporary national subject, with which he began, but the glories described pertain to Messiah's reign. Hezekiah cannot, as some think, be the subject; for he was already come, whereas the "stem of Jesse" was yet future ("shall come") (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011">Mic 4:11</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001">Mic 5:1-2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5-6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jer 33:15-16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012">Rom 15:12</a>).
