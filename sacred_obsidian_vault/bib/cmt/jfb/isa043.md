 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New Testaments</i>, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001">Isaiah Chapter 43</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001">Isaiah 43:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 43:1</a></font></span></p>A SUCCESSION OF ARGUMENTS WHEREIN ISRAEL MAY BE ASSURED THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR PERVERSITY TOWARDS GOD (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025">Isa 42:25</a>), HE WILL DELIVER AND RESTORE THEM. (Isa. 43:1-28)
 <p>
 </p><p>But now--notwithstanding God's past just judgments for Israel's sins. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>created--not only in the general sense, but specially created as a peculiar people unto Himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007">Isa 43:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015">Isa 43:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021">Isa 43:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002">Isa 44:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021">Isa 44:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024">Isa 44:24</a>). So believers, "created in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010">Eph 2:10</a>), "a peculiar people" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>redeemed--a second argument why they should trust Him besides creation. The Hebrew means to ransom by a price paid in lieu of the captives (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003">Isa 43:3</a>). Babylon was to be the ransom in this case, that is, was to be destroyed, in order that they might be delivered; so Christ became a curse, doomed to death, that we might be redeemed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>called . . . by . . . name--not merely "called" in general, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006">Isa 42:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012">Isa 48:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002">Isa 51:2</a>, but designated as His own peculiar people (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003">Isa 45:3-4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001">Exo 32:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012">Exo 33:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003">Joh 10:3</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002">Isaiah 43:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">isa 43:2</a></font></span></p>rivers . . . not overflow thee--so in passing Jordan, though at its "overflow," when its "swellings" were especially dangerous (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015">Jos 3:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005">Jer 12:5</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>waters . . . fire--a proverbial phrase for the extremest perils (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012">Psa 66:12</a>; also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#007">Psa 138:7</a>). Literally fulfilled at the Red Sea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021">Exo 14:21-22</a>), and in the case of the three youths cast into the fiery furnace for conscience' sake (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025">Dan 3:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027">Dan 3:27</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003">Isaiah 43:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">isa 43:3</a></font></span></p>Egypt for thy ransom--Either Egypt or Israel must perish; God chose that Egypt, though so much more mighty, should be destroyed, in order that His people might be delivered; thus Egypt stood, instead of Israel, as a kind of "ransom." The Hebrew, kopher, means properly "that with which anything is overlaid," as the pitch with which the ark was overlaid; hence that which covers over sins, an atonement. Nebuchadnezzar had subdued Egypt, Ethiopia (Hebrew, Cush), and Saba (descended from Cush, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007">Gen 10:7</a>, probably Meroe of Ethiopia, a great island formed by the Astaboras and the Nile, conquered by Cambyses, successor of Cyrus). Cyrus received these from God with the rest of the Babylonian dominions, in consideration of his being about to deliver Israel. However, the reference may be to the three years' war in which Sargon overcame these countries, and so had his attention diverted from Israel (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isa 20:1</a>) [VITRINGA]. But the reference is probably more general, namely, to all the instances in which Jehovah sacrificed mighty heathen nations, when the safety of Israel required it.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004">Isaiah 43:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">isa 43:4</a></font></span></p>Since--All along from the beginning; for there was never a time when Israel was not Jehovah's people. The apodosis should be at, "I will give." "Since ever thou wast precious in My sight, honorable, and that I loved thee, I will give," &amp;c. [MAURER]. GESENIUS, as English Version, takes "Since" to mean, "Inasmuch as." If the apodosis be as in English Version, "Since thou wast precious" will refer to the time when God called His people out of Egypt, manifesting then first the love which He had from everlasting towards them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003">Jer 31:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</a>); "honorable" and "loved," refer to outward marks of honor and love from God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>men . . . people--other nations for thee (so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003">Isa 43:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>thy life--thy person.
 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>seed--descendants scattered in all lands. VITRINGA understands it of the spiritual "seed" of the Church produced by mystical regeneration: for the expression is, "bring," not "bring back." This sense is perhaps included, but not to the exclusion of the literal Israel's restoration (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010">Jer 30:10-11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009">Amo 9:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006">Zac 2:6-13</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006">Isaiah 43:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">isa 43:6</a></font></span></p>Give up--namely, My people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>sons . . . daughters--The feminine joined to the masculine expresses the complete totality of anything (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017">Zac 9:17</a>).
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">isa 43:7</a></font></span></p>called by my name--belong to Israel, whose people, as sons of God, bear the name of their Father (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005">Isa 44:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001">Isa 48:1</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>for my glory-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021">Isa 43:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023">Isa 29:23</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008">Isaiah 43:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 43:8</a></font></span></p>Solemn challenge given by God to the nations to argue with Him the question of His superiority to their idols, and His power to deliver Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001">Isa 41:1</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>blind people--the Gentiles, who also, like Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019">Isa 42:19</a>), are blind (spiritually), though having eyes; that is, natural faculties, whereby they might know God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020">Rom 1:20-21</a>) [LOWTH]. Or else, the Jews [VITRINGA].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009">Isaiah 43:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 43:9</a></font></span></p>who . . . can declare this--who among the idolatrous soothsayers hath predicted this; that is, as to Cyrus being the deliverer of Israel? 
 <p>
 </p><p>former--predictions, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009">Isa 42:9</a> [MAURER]. Or, things that shall first come to pass (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021">Isa 41:21-22</a>) [BARNES]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>let them bring forth their witnesses--as I do mine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010">Isa 43:10</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>justified--declared veracious in their pretended prophecies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>or--rather, "and"; let men hear their prediction and say, from the event, It is verified (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026">Isa 41:26</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010">Isaiah 43:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 43:10</a></font></span></p>Ye--the Jews, to whom I have given predictions, verified by the event; and in delivering whom I have so often manifested MY power (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003">Isa 43:3-4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008">Isa 44:8</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>and my servant--that is, the whole Jewish people (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008">Isa 41:8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>believe--trust in. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>formed--before I existed none of the false gods were formed. "Formed" applies to the idols, not to God. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011">Rev 1:11</a> uses the same language to prove the Godhead of Jesus, as Isaiah here to prove the Godhead of Jehovah.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#011">Isaiah 43:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 43:11</a></font></span></p>Lord--Jehovah.

 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012">Isaiah 43:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">isa 43:12</a></font></span></p>declared--predicted the future (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022">Isa 41:22-23</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>saved--the nation, in past times of danger. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>showed--namely, that I was God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>when . . . no strange god, &amp;c.--to whom the predictions uttered by Me could be assigned. "Strange" means foreign, introduced from abroad.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013">Isaiah 43:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">isa 43:13</a></font></span></p>before--literally, from the time of the first existence of day. 
 <p>
 </p><p>let--Old English for "hinder" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027">Isa 14:27</a>). Rather, translate, "undo it" [HORSLEY].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014">Isaiah 43:14</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>brought down--"made to go down" to the sea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010">Isa 42:10</a>), in order to escape the impending destruction of Babylon. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>nobles--rather, "fugitives," namely, the foreigners who sojourned in populous Babylon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014">Isa 13:14</a>), distinct from the Chaldeans [MAURER]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>whose cry is in the ships--exulting in their ships with the joyous sailors--cry, boastingly; their joy heretofore in their ships contrasts sadly with their present panic in fleeing to them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002">Isa 22:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015">Zep 2:15</a>). Babylon was on the Euphrates, which was joined to the Tigris by a canal, and flowed into the Persian Gulf. Thus it was famed for ships and commerce until the Persian monarchs, to prevent revolt or invasion, obstructed navigation by dams across the Tigris and Euphrates.
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">isa 43:16</a></font></span></p>Allusion to the deliverance of Israel and overthrow of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, the standing illustration of God's unchanging character towards His people (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021">Exo 14:21-22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027">Exo 14:27-28</a>).
 <p>

Plainly the future restoration of Israel is the event ultimately meant. Thus the "former things" are such events as the destruction of Sennacherib and the return from Babylon. "Things of old" are events still more ancient, the deliverance from Egypt and at the Red Sea, and entry into Canaan [VITRINGA].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019">Isaiah 43:19</a></p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>way in . . . wilderness--just as Israel in the wilderness, between the Red Sea and Canaan, was guided, and supplied with water by Jehovah; but the "new" deliverance shall be attended with manifestations of God's power and love, eclipsing the old (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017">Isa 41:17-19</a>). "I will open a way, not merely in the Red Sea, but in the wilderness of the whole world; and not merely one river shall gush out of the rock, but many, which shall refresh, not the bodies as formerly, but the souls of the thirsty, so that the prophecy shall be fulfilled: 'With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation'" [JEROME]. "A way" often stands for the true religion (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002">Act 9:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026">Act 18:26</a>). "Rivers" express the influences of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037">Joh 7:37-39</a>). Israel's literal restoration hereafter is included, as appears by comparing <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isa 11:15-16</a>.

 </p><p>made me to serve--though "I have not caused thee to serve" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023">Isa 43:23</a>). Our sin made the Son of God to become "a servant." He served to save us from servile bondage (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014">Heb 2:14-15</a>).

How abominable a thing sin is, since it is against such a God of grace! "Blotted out" is an image from an account-book, in which, when a debt is paid, the charge is cancelled or blotted out.

 </p><p>not remember . . . sins-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034">Jer 31:34</a>). When God forgives, He forgets; that is, treats the sinner as if He had forgotten his sins.

So Jacob did at Mahanaim and Peniel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009">Gen 32:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012">Gen 32:12</a>). God, then, instead of "pleading against us with His great power," "will put His strength" in us (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</a>); we thus become "the Lord's remembrancers" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006">Isa 62:6</a>, Margin). "Declare God's righteousness" vindicated in Jesus Christ "that thou mayest be justified" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026">Rom 3:26</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001">Isa 20:1-6</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002">Psa 143:2</a>).

Or, thy chief religious ministers or priests [GESENIUS]. Adam, the common father of all nations, can hardly be meant here, as it would have been irrelevant to mention his sin in an address to the Jews specially. Abraham is equally out of place here, as he is everywhere cited as an example of faithfulness, not of "sin." However, taking the passage in its ultimate application to the Church at large, Adam may be meant.
