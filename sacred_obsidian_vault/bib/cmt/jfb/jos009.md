 <p>
 </p><p>all the kings which were on this side--that is, the western side of Jordan. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the hills, and in ther valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea--This threefold distinction marks out very clearly a large portion of Canaan. The first designates the hill country, which belonged afterwards to the tribes of Judah and Ephraim: the second, all the low country from Carmel to Gaza; and the third, the shores of the Mediterranean, from the Isthmus of Tyre to the plain of Joppa. (As for the tribes mentioned, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#029">Num 13:29</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>heard thereof--that is, of the sacking of Jericho and Ai, as well as the rapid advance of the Israelites into the interior of the country.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#002">Joshua 9:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 9:2</a></font></span></p>they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord--Although divided by separate interests and often at war with each other, a sense of common danger prompted them to suspend their mutual animosities, that by their united forces they might prevent the land from falling into the hands of foreign masters.

 <p>
 </p><p>when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard--This town, as its name imports, was situated on a rocky eminence, about six miles northwest from Jerusalem, where the modern village of El Jib now stands. It was the capital of the Hivites, and a large important city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002">Jos 10:2</a>). It seems to have formed, in union with a few other towns in the neighborhood, a free independent state (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017">Jos 9:17</a>) and to have enjoyed a republican government (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011">Jos 9:11</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004">Joshua 9:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jos 9:4</a></font></span></p>They did work wilily--They acted with dexterous policy, seeking the means of self-preservation, not by force, which they were convinced would be unavailing, but by artful diplomacy. 
 <p>
 </p><p>took old sacks upon their asses--Travellers in the East transport their luggage on beasts of burden; the poorer sort stow all their necessaries, food, clothes, utensils together, in a woollen or hair-cloth sack, laid across the shoulders of the beast they ride upon. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up--Goat-skins, which are better adapted for carrying liquor of any kind fresh and good, than either earthenware, which is porous, or metallic vessels, which are soon heated by the sun. These skin bottles are liable to be rent when old and much used; and there are various ways of mending them--by inserting a new piece of leather, or by gathering together the edges of the rent and sewing them in the form of a purse, or by putting a round flat splinter of wood into the hole.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#005">Joshua 9:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jos 9:5</a></font></span></p>old shoes and clouted--Those who have but one ass or mule for themselves and baggage frequently dismount and walk--a circumstance which may account for the worn shoes of the pretended travellers. 
 <p>
 </p><p>bread . . . dry and mouldy--This must have been that commonly used by travellers--a sort of biscuit made in the form of large rings, about an inch thick, and four or five inches in diameter. Not being so well baked as our biscuits, it becomes hard and mouldy from the moisture left in the dough. It is usually soaked in water previous to being used.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jos 9:6</a></font></span></p>they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal--Arrived at the Israelitish headquarters, the strangers obtained an interview with Joshua and the elders, to whom they opened their business.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007">Joshua 9:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jos 9:7</a></font></span></p>the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us--The answer of the Israelites implied that they had no discretion, that their orders were imperative, and that if the strangers belonged to any of the native tribes, the idea of an alliance with them was unlawful since God had forbidden it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032">Exo 23:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#012">Exo 34:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002">Deu 7:2</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009">Joshua 9:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jos 9:9</a></font></span></p>From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the Lord thy God--They pretended to be actuated by religious motives in seeking to be allied with His people. But their studied address is worthy of notice in appealing to instances of God's miraculous doings at a distance, while they pass by those done in Canaan, as if the report of these had not yet reached their ears.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014">Joshua 9:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jos 9:14</a></font></span></p>the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord--The mouldy appearance of their bread was, after examination, accepted as guaranteeing the truth of the story. In this precipitate conclusion the Israelites were guilty of excessive credulity and culpable negligence, in not asking by the high priest's Urim and Thummim the mind of God, before entering into the alliance. It is not clear, however, that had they applied for divine direction they would have been forbidden to spare and connect themselves with any of the Canaanite tribes who renounced idolatry and embraced and worshipped the true God. At least, no fault was found with them for making a covenant with the Gibeonites; while, on the other hand, the violation of it was severely punished (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001">Sa2 21:1</a>; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019">Jos 11:19-20</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#016">Joshua 9:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jos 9:16</a></font></span></p>at the end of three days . . . they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them--This information was obtained in their further progress through the country; for as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017">Jos 9:17</a> should be rendered, "when the children of Israel journeyed, they came to their cities." Gibeon was about eighteen or twenty miles from Gilgal.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017">Joshua 9:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 9:17</a></font></span></p>Chephirah-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#026">Jos 18:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#025">Ezr 2:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#029">Neh 7:29</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>Beeroth-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#002">Sa2 4:2</a>), now El Berich, about twenty minutes' distance from El Jib (Gibeon). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Kirjath-jearim--"the city of forests," now Kuryet-el-Enab [ROBINSON].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018">Joshua 9:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jos 9:18</a></font></span></p>the children of Israel smote them not--The moral character of the Gibeonites' stratagem was bad. The princes of the congregation did not vindicate either the expediency or the lawfulness of the connection they had formed; but they felt the solemn obligations of their oath; and, although the popular clamor was loud against them, caused either by disappointment at losing the spoils of Gibeon, or by displeasure at the apparent breach of the divine commandment, they determined to adhere to their pledge, "because they had sworn by the Lord God of Israel." The Israelitish princes acted conscientiously; they felt themselves bound by their solemn promise; but to prevent the disastrous consequences of their imprudent haste, they resolved to degrade the Gibeonites to a servile condition as a means of preventing their people from being ensnared into idolatry, and thus acted up, as they thought, to the true spirit and end of the law.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027">Joshua 9:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">jos 9:27</a></font></span></p>hewers of wood and drawers of water--The menials who performed the lowest offices and drudgery in the sanctuary; whence they were called Nethinims (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002">Ch1 9:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043">Ezr 2:43</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#020">Ezr 8:20</a>); that is, given, appropriated. Their chastisement thus brought them into the possession of great religious privileges (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010">Psa 84:10</a>).
