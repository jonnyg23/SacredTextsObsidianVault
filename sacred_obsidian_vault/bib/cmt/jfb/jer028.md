HANANIAH BREAKS THE YOKES TO SIGNIFY THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S YOKE SHALL BE BROKEN. JEREMIAH FORETELLS THAT YOKES OF IRON ARE TO SUCCEED THOSE OF WOOD, AND THAT HANANIAH SHALL DIE. (Jer. 28:1-17)
 <p>
 </p><p>in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah--The Jews often divided any period into two halves, the beginning and the end. As Zedekiah reigned eleven years, the fourth year would be called the beginning of his reign, especially as during the first three years affairs were in such a disturbed state that he had little power or dignity, being a tributary; but in the fourth year he became strong in power. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Hananiah--Another of this name was one of the three godly youths who braved Nebuchadnezzar's wrath in the fear of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#006">Dan 1:6-7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012">Dan 3:12</a>). Probably a near relation, for Azariah is associated with him; as Azur with the Hananiah here. The godly and ungodly are often in the same family (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014">Eze 18:14-20</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Gibeon--one of the cities of the priests, to which order he must have belonged. 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002">Jeremiah 28:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 28:2</a></font></span></p>broken the yoke--I have determined to break: referring to Jeremiah's prophecy (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012">Jer 27:12</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003">Jeremiah 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jer 28:3</a></font></span></p>two full years--literally, "years of days." So "a month of days," that is, all its days complete (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014">Gen 29:14</a>, Margin; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001">Gen 41:1</a>). It was marvellous presumption to speak so definitely without having any divine revelation.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004">Jeremiah 28:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jer 28:4</a></font></span></p>bring again . . . Jeconiah--not necessarily implying that Hananiah wished Zedekiah to be superseded by Jeconiah. The main point intended was that the restoration from Babylon should be complete. But, doubtless, the false prophet foretold Jeconiah's return (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012">Kg2 24:12-15</a>), to ingratiate himself with the populace, with whom Jeconiah was a favorite (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024">Jer 22:24</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#005">Jeremiah 28:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 28:5</a></font></span></p>the prophet Jeremiah--the epithet, "the prophet," is prefixed to "Jeremiah" throughout this chapter, to correspond to the same epithet before "Hananiah"; except in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012">Jer 28:12</a>, where "the prophet" has been inserted in English Version. The rival claims of the true and the false prophet are thus put in the more prominent contrast.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006">Jeremiah 28:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 28:6</a></font></span></p>Amen--Jeremiah prays for the people, though constrained to prophesy against them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#036">Kg1 1:36</a>). The event was the appointed test between contradictory predictions (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#021">Deu 18:21-22</a>). "Would that what you say were true!" I prefer the safety of my country even to my own estimation. The prophets had no pleasure in announcing God's judgment, but did so as a matter of stern duty, not thereby divesting themselves of their natural feelings of sorrow for their country's woe. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Exo 32:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Rom 9:3</a>, as instances of how God's servants, intent only on the glory of God and the salvation of the country, forgot self and uttered wishes in a state of feeling transported out of themselves. So Jeremiah wished not to diminish aught from the word of God, though as a Jew he uttered the wish for his people [CALVIN].
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008">Jeremiah 28:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 28:8</a></font></span></p>prophets . . . before me--Hosea, Joel, Amos, and others. 
 <p>
 </p><p>evil--a few manuscripts, read "famine," which is more usually associated with the specification of war and pestilence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002">Jer 15:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021">Jer 18:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008">Jer 27:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013">Jer 27:13</a>). But evil here includes all the calamities flowing from war, not merely famine, but also desolation, &amp;c. Evil, being the more difficult reading, is less likely to be the interpolated one than famine, which probably originated in copying the parallel passages.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009">Jeremiah 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 28:9</a></font></span></p>peace--Hananiah had given no warning as to the need of conversion, but had foretold prosperity unconditionally. Jeremiah does not say that all are true prophets who foretell truths in any instance (which <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001">Deu 13:1-2</a>, disproves); but asserts only the converse, namely, that whoever, as Hananiah, predicts what the event does not confirm, is a false prophet. There are two tests of prophets: (1) The event, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022">Deu 18:22</a>. (2) The word of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020">Isa 8:20</a>.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010">Jeremiah 28:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 28:10</a></font></span></p>the yoke-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002">Jer 27:2</a>). Impious audacity to break what God had appointed as a solemn pledge of the fulfilment of His word. Hence Jeremiah deigns no reply (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011">Jer 28:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006">Mat 7:6</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011">Jeremiah 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 28:11</a></font></span></p>neck of all nations--opposed to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007">Jer 27:7</a>.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013">Jeremiah 28:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jer 28:13</a></font></span></p>Thou hast broken . . . wood . . . thou shalt make . . . iron--Not here, "Thou hast broken . . . wood," and "I will make . . . iron" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016">Jer 28:16</a>). The same false prophets who, by urging the Jews to rebel, had caused them to throw off the then comparatively easy yoke of Babylon, thereby brought on them a more severe yoke imposed by that city. "Yokes of iron," alluding to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048">Deu 28:48</a>. It is better to take up a light cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. We may escape destroying providences by submitting to humbling providences. So, spiritually, contrast the "easy yoke" of Christ with the "yoke of bondage" of the law (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010">Act 15:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001">Gal 5:1</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014">Jeremiah 28:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jer 28:14</a></font></span></p>I have put--Though Hananiah and those like him were secondary instruments in bringing the iron yoke on Judea, God was the great First Cause (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#004">Jer 27:4-7</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015">Jeremiah 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jer 28:15</a></font></span></p>makest . . . trust in a lie-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031">Jer 29:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022">Eze 13:22</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016">Jeremiah 28:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jer 28:16</a></font></span></p>this year . . . die--The prediction was uttered in the fifth month (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001">Jer 28:1</a>); Hananiah's death took place in the seventh month, that is, within two months after the prediction, answering with awful significance to the two years in which Hananiah had foretold that the yoke imposed by Babylon would end. 
 <p>
 </p><p>rebellion--opposition to God's plain direction, that all should submit to Babylon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032">Jer 29:32</a>).
