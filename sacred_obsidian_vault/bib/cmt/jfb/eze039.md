 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 39:9</a></font></span></p>The burning of the foe's weapons implies that nothing belonging to them should be left to pollute the land. The seven years (seven being the sacred number) spent on this work, implies the completeness of the cleansing, and the people's zeal for purity. How different from the ancient Israelites, who left not merely the arms, but the heathen themselves, to remain among them [FAIRBAIRN], (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027">Jdg 1:27-28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#002">Jdg 2:2-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034">Psa 106:34-36</a>). The desolation by Antiochus began in the one hundred and forty-first year of the SeleucidÃ&amp;brvbr;. From this date to 148, a period of six years and four months ("2300 days," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014">Dan 8:14</a>), when the temple-worship was restored (1 Maccabees 4:52), God vouchsafed many triumphs to His people; from this time to the death of Antiochus, early in 149, a period of seven months, the Jews had rest from Antiochus, and purified their land, and on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month celebrated the EncÃ&amp;brvbr;nia, or feast of dedication (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022">Joh 10:22</a>) and purification of the temple. The whole period, in round numbers, was seven years. Mattathias was the patriotic Jewish leader, and his third son, Judas, the military commander under whom the Syrian generals were defeated. He retook Jerusalem and purified the temple. Simon and Jonathan, his brothers, succeeded him: the independence of the Jews was secured, and the crown vested in the Asmonean family, in which it continued till Herod the Great.

The publicity of the road would cause many to observe God's judgments, as the stench (as English Version translates) or the multitude of graves (as HENDERSON translates, "it shall stop the passengers") would arrest the attention of passers-by. Their grave would be close to that of their ancient prototypes, Sodom and Gomorrah in the Dead Sea, both alike being signal instances of God's judgments.

Here this sacrifice holds only a subordinate place in the picture, and so is put last.

 <p>
 </p><p>The arrangements as to the land and the temple are, in many particulars, different from those subsisting before the captivity. There are things in it so improbable physically as to preclude a purely literal interpretation. The general truth seems to hold good that, as Israel served the nations for his rejection of Messiah, so shall they serve him in the person of Messiah, when he shall acknowledge Messiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012">Isa 60:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017">Zac 14:17-19</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011">Psa 72:11</a>). The ideal temple exhibits, under Old Testament forms (used as being those then familiar to the men whom Ezekiel, a priest himself, and one who delighted in sacrificial images, addresses), not the precise literal outline, but the essential character of the worship of Messiah as it shall be when He shall exercise sway in Jerusalem among His own people, the Jews, and thence to the ends of the earth. The very fact that the whole is a vision (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002">Eze 40:2</a>), not an oral face-to-face communication such as that granted to Moses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006">Num 12:6-8</a>), implies that the directions are not to be understood so precisely literally as those given to the Jewish lawgiver. The description involves things which, taken literally, almost involve natural impossibilities. The square of the temple, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020">Eze 42:20</a>, is six times as large as the circuit of the wall enclosing the old temple, and larger than all the earthly Jerusalem. Ezekiel gives three and a half miles and one hundred forty yards to his temple square. The boundaries of the ancient city were about two and a half miles. Again, the city in Ezekiel has an area between three or four thousand square miles, including the holy ground set apart for the prince, priests, and Levites. This is nearly as large as the whole of Judea west of the Jordan. As Zion lay in the center of the ideal city, the one-half of the sacred portion extended to nearly thirty miles south of Jerusalem, that is, covered nearly the whole southern territory, which reached only to the Dead Sea (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019">Eze 47:19</a>), and yet five tribes were to have their inheritance on that side of Jerusalem, beyond the sacred portion (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#023">Eze 48:23-28</a>). Where was land to be found for them there? A breadth of but four or five miles apiece would be left. As the boundaries of the land are given the same as under Moses, these incongruities cannot be explained away by supposing physical changes about to be effected in the land such as will meet the difficulties of the purely literal interpretation. The distribution of the land is in equal portions among the twelve tribes, without respect to their relative numbers, and the parallel sections running from east to west. There is a difficulty also in the supposed separate existence of the twelve tribes, such separate tribeships no longer existing, and it being hard to imagine how they could be restored as distinct tribes, mingled as they now are. So the stream that issued from the east threshold of the temple and flowed into the Dead Sea, in the rapidity of its increase and the quality of its waters, is unlike anything ever known in Judea or elsewhere in the world. Lastly, the catholicity of the Christian dispensation, and the spirituality of its worship, seem incompatible with a return to the local narrowness and "beggarly elements" of the Jewish ritual and carnal ordinances, disannulled "because of the unprofitableness thereof" [FAIRBAIRN], (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003">Gal 4:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Gal 4:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001">Gal 5:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010">Heb 9:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018">Heb 10:18</a>). "A temple with sacrifices now would be a denial of the all-sufficiency of the sacrifice of Christ. He who sacrificed before confessed the Messiah. He who should sacrifice now would solemnly deny Him" [DOUGLAS]. These difficulties, however, may be all seeming, not real. Faith accepts God's Word as it is, waits for the event, sure that it will clear up all such difficulties. Perhaps, as some think, the beau ideal of a sacred commonwealth is given according to the then existing pattern of temple services, which would be the imagery most familiar to the prophet and his hearers at the time. The minute particularizing of details is in accordance with Ezekiel's style, even in describing purely ideal scenes. The old temple embodied in visible forms and rites spiritual truths affecting the people even when absent from it. So this ideal temple is made in the absence of the outward temple to serve by description the same purpose of symbolical instruction as the old literal temple did by forms and acts. As in the beginning God promised to be a "sanctuary" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016">Eze 11:16</a>) to the captives at the Chebar, so now at the close is promised a complete restoration and realization of the theocratic worship and polity under Messiah in its noblest ideal (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038">Jer 31:38-40</a>). In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022">Rev 21:22</a> "no temple" is seen, as in the perfection of the new dispensation the accidents of place and form are no longer needed to realize to Christians what Ezekiel imparts to Jewish minds by the imagery familiar to them. In Ezekiel's temple holiness stretches over the entire temple, so that in this there is no longer a distinction between the different parts, as in the old temple: parts left undeterminate in the latter obtain now a divine sanction, so that all arbitrariness is excluded. So that it is be a perfect manifestation of the love of God to His covenant-people (Eze. 40:1-43:12); and from it, as from a new center of religious life, there gushes forth the fulness of blessings to them, and so to all people (Eze. 47:1-23) [FAIRBAIRN and HAVERNICK]. The temple built at the return from Babylon can only very partially have realized the model here given. The law is seemingly opposed to the gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021">Mat 5:21-22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027">Mat 5:27-28</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033">Mat 5:33-34</a>). It is not really so (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017">Mat 5:17-18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031">Rom 3:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021">Gal 3:21-22</a>). It is true Christ's sacrifice superseded the law sacrifices (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012">Heb 10:12-18</a>). Israel's province may hereafter be to show the essential identity, even in the minute details of the temple sacrifices, between the law and gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008">Rom 10:8</a>). The ideal of the theocratic temple will then first be realized.
