 <p>
 </p><p>Son of man--often applied to Ezekiel; once only to Daniel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017">Dan 8:17</a>), and not to any other prophet. The phrase was no doubt taken from Chaldean usage during the sojourn of Daniel and Ezekiel in Chaldea. But the spirit who sanctioned the words of the prophet implied by it the lowliness and frailty of the prophet as man "lower than the angels," though now admitted to the vision of angels and of God Himself, "lest he should be exalted through the abundance of the revelations" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007">Co2 12:7</a>). He is appropriately so called as being type of the divine "Son of man" here revealed as "man" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026">Eze 1:26</a>). That title, as applied to Messiah, implies at once His lowliness and His exaltation, in His manifestations as the Representative man, at His first and second comings respectively (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004">Psa 8:4-8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013">Mat 16:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018">Mat 20:18</a>; and on the other hand, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013">Dan 7:13-14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064">Mat 26:64</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027">Joh 5:27</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002">Ezekiel 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">eze 2:2</a></font></span></p>spirit entered . . . when he spake--The divine word is ever accompanied by the Spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002">Gen 1:2-3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>set . . . upon . . . feet--He had been "upon his face" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028">Eze 1:28</a>). Humiliation on our part is followed by exaltation on God's part (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023">Eze 3:23-24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029">Job 22:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006">Jam 4:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005">Pe1 5:5</a>). "On the feet" was the fitting attitude when he was called on to walk and work for God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008">Eph 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015">Eph 6:15</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>that I heard--rather, "then I heard."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003">Ezekiel 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 2:3</a></font></span></p>nation--rather, "nations"; the word usually applied to the heathen or Gentiles; here to the Jews, as being altogether heathenized with idolatries. So in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010">Isa 1:10</a>, they are named "Sodom" and "Gomorrah." They were now become "Lo-ammi," not the people of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009">Hos 1:9</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004">Ezekiel 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">eze 2:4</a></font></span></p>impudent--literally, "hard-faced" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007">Eze 3:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009">Eze 3:9</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>children--resumptive of "they" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003">Eze 2:3</a>); the "children" walk in their "fathers'" steps. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I . . . send thee--God opposes His command to all obstacles. Duties are ours; events are God's. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Thus saith the Lord God--God opposes His name to the obstinacy of the people.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005">Ezekiel 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 2:5</a></font></span></p>forbear--namely, to hear. 
 <p>
 </p><p>yet shall know--Even if they will not hear, at least they will not have ignorance to plead as the cause of their perversity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#033">Eze 33:33</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006">Ezekiel 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eze 2:6</a></font></span></p>briers--not as the Margin and GESENIUS, "rebels," which would not correspond so well to "thorns." The Hebrew is from a root meaning "to sting" as nettles do. The wicked are often so called (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006">Sa2 23:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002">Sol 2:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018">Isa 9:18</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>scorpions--a reptile about six inches long with a deadly sting at the end of the tail. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>be not afraid-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004">Luk 12:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014">Pe1 3:14</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007">Ezekiel 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">eze 2:7</a></font></span></p>most rebellious--literally, "rebellion" itself: its very essence.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008">Ezekiel 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eze 2:8</a></font></span></p>eat--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016">Jer 15:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009">Rev 10:9-10</a>). The idea is to possess himself fully of the message and digest it in the mind; not literal eating, but such an appropriation of its unsavory contents that they should become, as it were, part of himself, so as to impart them the more vividly to his hearers.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009">Ezekiel 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 2:9</a></font></span></p>roll--the form in which ancient books were made.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010">Ezekiel 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 2:10</a></font></span></p>within and without--on the face and the back. Usually the parchment was written only on its inside when rolled up; but so full was God's message of impending woes that it was written also on the back.
