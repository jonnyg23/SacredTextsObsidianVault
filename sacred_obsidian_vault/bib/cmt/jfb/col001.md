 <p>
 </p><p>by the will of God--Greek, "through," &amp;c. (compare Note, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001">Co1 1:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Timothy--(Compare Notes, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001">Co2 1:1</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001">Phi 1:1</a>). He was with Paul at the time of writing in Rome. He had been companion of Paul in his first tour through Phrygia, in which Colosse was. Hence the Colossians seem to have associated him with Paul in their affections, and the apostle joins him with himself in the address. Neither, probably, had seen the Colossian Church (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001">Col 2:1</a>); but had seen, during their tour through Phrygia, individual Colossians, as Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus, and Apphia (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002">Plm 1:2</a>), who when converted brought the Gospel to their native city.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002">Colossians 1:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">col 1:2</a></font></span></p>Colosse--written in the oldest manuscripts, "Colasse." As "saints" implies union with God, so "the faithful brethren" union with Christian men [BENGEL]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the Lord Jesus Christ--supported by some oldest manuscripts omitted by others of equal antiquity.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003">Colossians 1:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">col 1:3</a></font></span></p>Thanksgiving for the "faith, hope, and love" of the Colossians. So in the twin Epistle sent at the same time and by the same bearer, Tychicus (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015">Eph 1:15-16</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>We--I and Timothy. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the Father--So some of the oldest manuscripts read. But others better omit the "and," which probably crept in from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003">Eph 1:3</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>praying always for you--with thanksgiving (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">Phi 4:6</a>). See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004">Col 1:4</a>.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004">Colossians 1:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">col 1:4</a></font></span></p>Since we heard--literally, "Having heard." The language implies that he had only heard of, and not seen, them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001">Col 2:1</a>). Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008">Rom 1:8</a>, where like language is used of a Church which he had not at the time visited. 
 <p>
 </p><p>love . . . to all--the absent, as well as those present [BENGEL].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005">Colossians 1:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">col 1:5</a></font></span></p>For--to be joined with the words immediately preceding: "The love which ye have to all the saints because of (literally, 'on account of') the hope," &amp;c. The hope of eternal life will never be in us an inactive principle but will always produce "love." This passage is abused by Romanists, as if the hope of salvation depended upon works. A false argument. It does not follow that our hope is founded on our works because we are strongly stimulated to live well; since nothing is more effectual for this purpose than the sense of God's free grace [CALVIN]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>laid up--a treasure laid up so as to be out of danger of being lost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008">Ti2 4:8</a>). Faith, love, and hope (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004">Col 1:4-5</a>), comprise the sum of Christianity. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023">Col 1:23</a>, "the hope of the Gospel." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in heaven--Greek, "in the heavens." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>whereof ye heard before--namely, at the time when it was preached to you. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in the word, &amp;c.--That "hope" formed part of "the word of the truth of the Gospel" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013">Eph 1:13</a>), that is, part of the Gospel truth preached unto you.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006">Colossians 1:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">col 1:6</a></font></span></p>Which is come unto you--Greek, "Which is present among you," that is, which has come to, and remains with, you. He speaks of the word as a living person present among them. 
 <p>
 </p><p>as it is in all the world--virtually, as it was by this time preached in the leading parts of the then known world; potentially, as Christ's command was that the Gospel should be preached to all nations, and not be limited, as the law was, to the Jews (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038">Mat 13:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014">Mat 24:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019">Mat 28:19</a>). However, the true reading, and that of the oldest manuscripts, is that which omits the following "and," thus (the "it is" of English Version is not in the original Greek): "As in all the world it is bringing forth fruit and growing (so the oldest manuscripts read; English Version omits 'and growing,' without good authority), even as it doth in you also." Then what is asserted is not that the Gospel has been preached in all the world, but that it is bearing fruits of righteousness, and (like a tree growing at the same time that it is bearing fruit) growing in numbers of its converts in, or throughout, all the world. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>heard of it--rather, "heard it." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and knew--rather, "came to know"; became fully experimentally acquainted with. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the grace of God in truth--that is, in its truth, and with true knowledge [ALFORD].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007">Colossians 1:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">col 1:7</a></font></span></p>As ye also learned--"Also" is omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The insertion implied that those inserting it thought that Paul had preached the Gospel to the Colossians as well as Epaphras, Whereas the omission in the oldest manuscripts implies that Epaphras alone was the founder of the Church at Colosse. 
 <p>
 </p><p>of--"from Epaphras." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>dear--Greek, "beloved." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>fellow servant--namely, of Christ. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023">Plm 1:23</a> he calls him "my fellow prisoner." It is possible that Epaphras may have been apprehended for his zealous labors in Asia Minor; but more probable that Paul gave him the title; as his faithful companion in his imprisonment (compare Note, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010">Col 4:10</a>, as to MEYER'S conjecture). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>who is for you, &amp;c.--Translate, "who is faithful in your behalf as a minister of Christ"; hinting that he is one not to be set aside for the new and erroneous teachers (Col. 2:1-23). Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "for (or 'in behalf of') US." Vulgate, however, with one of the oldest manuscripts, supports English Version.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008">Colossians 1:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">col 1:8</a></font></span></p>your love-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004">Col 1:4</a>); "to all the saints." 
 <p>
 </p><p>in the Spirit--the sphere or element IN which alone true love is found; as distinguished from the state of those "in the flesh" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009">Rom 8:9</a>). Yet even they needed to be stirred up to greater love (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012">Col 3:12-14</a>). Love is the first and chief fruit of the Spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022">Gal 5:22</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009">Colossians 1:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">col 1:9</a></font></span></p>we also--on our part. 
 <p>
 </p><p>heard it-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004">Col 1:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>pray--Here he states what in particular he prays for; as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003">Col 1:3</a> he stated generally the fact of his praying for them. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to desire--"to make request." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>might be filled--rather, "may be filled"; a verb, often found in this Epistle (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012">Col 4:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017">Col 4:17</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>knowledge--Greek, "full and accurate knowledge." Akin to the Greek for "knew" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006">Col 1:6</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>of his will--as to how ye ought to walk (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017">Eph 5:17</a>); as well as chiefly that "mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself; that in the fulness of times He might gather together in one all things in Christ" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009">Eph 1:9-10</a>); God's "will," whereby He eternally purposed to reconcile to Himself, and save men by Christ, not by angels, as the false teachers in some degree taught (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18</a>) [ESTIUS]. There seems to have been a want of knowledge among the Colossians; notwithstanding their general excellencies; hence he so often dwells on this subject (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028">Col 1:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002">Col 2:2-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010">Col 3:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013">Col 3:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005">Col 4:5-6</a>). On the contrary he less extols wisdom to the Corinthians, who were puffed up with the conceit of knowledge. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wisdom--often mentioned in this Epistle, as opposed to the (false) "philosophy" and "show of wisdom" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008">Col 2:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023">Col 2:23</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008">Eph 1:8</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>understanding--sagacity to discern what on each occasion is suited to the place and the time; its seat is "the understanding" or intellect; wisdom is more general and has its seat in the whole compass of the faculties of the soul [BENGEL]. "Wouldst thou know that the matters in the word of Christ are real things? Then never read them for mere knowledge sake" [Quoted by GAUSSEN.] Knowledge is desirable only when seasoned by "spiritual understanding."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010">Colossians 1:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">col 1:10</a></font></span></p>Greek, "So as to walk"; so that ye may walk. True knowledge of God's will is inseparable from walking conformably to it. 
 <p>
 </p><p>worthy of the Lord-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001">Eph 4:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto--so as in every way to be well-pleasing to God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>pleasing--literally, "desire of pleasing." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>being fruitful--Greek, "bearing fruit." This is the first manifestation of their "walking worthy of the Lord." The second is, "increasing (growing) in the knowledge of God (or as the oldest manuscripts read, 'growing BY the full knowledge of God')"; thus, as the Gospel word (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006">Col 1:6</a>) was said to "bring forth fruit," and to "grow" in all the world, even as it did in the Colossians, ever since the day they knew the grace of God, so here it is Paul's prayer that they might continue to "bring forth fruit," and "grow" more and more by the full knowledge of God, the more that "knowledge" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009">Col 1:9</a>) was imparted to them. The full knowledge of God is the real instrument of enlargement in soul and life of the believer [ALFORD]. The third manifestation of their walk is (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011">Col 1:11</a>), "Being strengthened with all might," &amp;c. The fourth is (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012">Col 1:12</a>), "Giving thanks unto the Father," &amp;c.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011">Colossians 1:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">col 1:11</a></font></span></p>Greek, "Being made mighty with (literally, 'in') all might." 
 <p>
 </p><p>according to his glorious power--rather, "according to the power (the characteristic of 'His glory,' here appropriate to Paul's argument, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019">Eph 1:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010">Eph 6:10</a>; as its exuberant 'riches,' in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016">Eph 3:16</a>) of His glory." His power is inseparable from His glory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004">Rom 6:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto all patience--so as to attain to all patient endurance; persevering, enduring continuance in the faith, in spite of trials of persecutors, and seductions of false teachers. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>long-suffering--towards those whom one could repel. "Patience," or "endurance," is exercised in respect to those whom one cannot repel [CHRYSOSTOM]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>with joyfulness--joyful endurance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025">Act 16:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Rom 5:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011">Rom 5:11</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012">Colossians 1:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">col 1:12</a></font></span></p>You "giving thanks unto the Father." See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010">Col 1:10</a>; this clause is connected with "that ye may be filled" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009">Col 1:9</a>), and "that ye may walk" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010">Col 1:10</a>). The connection is not, "We do not cease to pray for you (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009">Col 1:9</a>) giving thanks." 
 <p>
 </p><p>unto the Father--of Jesus Christ, and so our Father by adoption (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026">Gal 3:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Gal 4:4-6</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which hath made us meet--Greek, "who made us meet." Not "is making us meet" by progressive growth in holiness; but once for all made us meet. It is not primarily the Spirit's work that is meant here, as the text is often used; but the Father's work in putting us by adoption, once for all, in a new standing, namely, that of children. The believers meant here were in different stages of progressive sanctification; but in respect to the meetness specified here, they all alike had it from the Father, in Christ His Son, being "complete in Him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010">Col 2:10</a>). Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017">Joh 17:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001">Jde 1:1</a>, "sanctified by God the Father"; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</a>. Still, secondarily, this once-for-all meetness contains in it the germ of sanctification, afterwards developed progressively in the life by the Father's Spirit in the believer. The Christian life of heavenliness is the first stage of heaven itself. There must, and will be, a personal meetness for heaven, where there is a judicial meetness. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to be partakers, &amp;c.--Greek, "for the (or 'our') portion of the inheritance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032">Act 20:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018">Act 26:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011">Eph 1:11</a>) of the saints in light." "Light" begins in the believer here, descending from "the Father of lights" by Jesus, "the true light," and is perfected in the kingdom of light, which includes knowledge, purity, love, and joy. It is contrasted here with the "darkness" of the unconverted state (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013">Col 1:13</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013">Colossians 1:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">col 1:13</a></font></span></p>from--Greek, "out of the power," out of the sphere in which his power is exercised. 
 <p>
 </p><p>darkness--blindness, hatred, misery [BENGEL]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>translated--Those thus translated as to state, are also transformed as to character. Satan has an organized dominion with various orders of powers of evil (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012">Eph 6:12</a>). But the term "kingdom" is rarely applied to his usurped rule (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026">Mat 12:26</a>); it is generally restricted to the kingdom of God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>his dear Son--rather as Greek, "the Son of His love": the Son on whom His love rests (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026">Joh 17:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006">Eph 1:6</a>): contrasted with the "darkness" where all is hatred and hateful.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014">Colossians 1:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">col 1:14</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007">Eph 1:7</a>.) 
 <p>
 </p><p>redemption--rather as Greek, "our redemption." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>through his blood--omitted in the oldest manuscripts; probably inserted from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007">Eph 1:7</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>sins--Translate as Greek, "our sins." The more general term: for which <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007">Eph 1:7</a>, Greek, has, "our transgressions," the more special term.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Colossians 1:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">col 1:15</a></font></span></p>They who have experienced in themselves "redemption" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014">Col 1:14</a>), know Christ in the glorious character here described, as above the highest angels to whom the false teachers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18</a>) taught worship was to be paid. Paul describes Him: (1) in relation to God and creation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15-17</a>); (2) in relation to the Church (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18-20</a>). As the former regards Him as the Creator (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15-16</a>) and the Sustainer (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017">Col 1:17</a>) of the natural world; so the latter, as the source and stay of the new moral creation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>image--exact likeness and perfect Representative. Adam was made "in the image of God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027">Gen 1:27</a>). But Christ, the second Adam, perfectly reflected visibly "the invisible God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017">Ti1 1:17</a>), whose glories the first Adam only in part represented. "Image" (eicon) involves "likeness" (homoiosis); but "likeness" does not involve "image." "Image" always supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the living image of the parent. "Likeness" implies mere resemblance, not the exact counterpart and derivation as "image" expresses; hence it is nowhere applied to the Son, while "image" is here, compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007">Co1 11:7</a> [TRENCH]. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018">Joh 1:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009">Joh 14:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004">Co2 4:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">Ti1 3:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3</a>). Even before His incarnation He was the image of the invisible God, as the Word (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001">Joh 1:1-3</a>) by whom God created the worlds, and by whom God appeared to the patriarchs. Thus His essential character as always "the image of God," (1) before the incarnation, (2) in the days of His flesh, and (3) now in His glorified state, is, I think, contemplated here by the verb "is." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>first-born of every creature-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006">Heb 1:6</a>), "the first-begotten": "begotten of His Father before all worlds" [Nicene Creed]. Priority and superlative dignity is implied (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027">Psa 89:27</a>). English Version might seem to favor Arianism, as if Christ were a creature. Translate, "Begotten (literally, 'born') before every creature," as the context shows, which gives the reason why He is so designated. "For," &amp;c. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016">Col 1:16-17</a>) [TRENCH]. This expression is understood by ORIGEN (so far is the Greek from favoring Socinian or Arian views) as declaring the Godhead of Christ, and is used by Him as a phrase to mark that Godhead, in contrast with His manhood [Book 2, sec. Against Celsus]. The Greek does not strictly admit ALFORD'S translation, "the first-born of all creation."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">col 1:16</a></font></span></p>For--Greek, "Because." This gives the proof that He is not included in the things created, but is the "first-begotten" before "every creature" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>), begotten as "the Son of God's love" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013">Col 1:13</a>), antecedently to all other emanations: "for" all these other emanations came from Him, and whatever was created, was created by Him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>by him--rather as Greek, "in Him": as the conditional element, pre-existent and all-including: the creation of all things BY Him is expressed afterwards, and is a different fact from the present one, though implied in it [ALFORD]. God revealed Himself in the Son, the Word of the Father, before all created existence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>). That Divine Word carries IN Himself the archetypes of all existences, so that "IN Him all things that are in heaven and earth have been created." The "in Him" indicates that the Word is the ideal ground of all existence; the "by Him," below, that He is the instrument of actually realizing the divine idea [NEANDER]. His essential nature as the Word of the Father is not a mere appendage of His incarnation, but is the ground of it. The original relation of the Eternal Word to men "made in His image" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027">Gen 1:27</a>), is the source of the new relation to them by redemption, formed in His incarnation, whereby He restores them to His lost image. "In Him" implies something prior to "by" and "for Him" presently after: the three prepositions mark in succession the beginning, the progress, and the end [BENGEL]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>all things--Greek, "the universe of things." That the new creation is not meant in this verse (as Socinians interpret), is plain; for angels, who are included in the catalogue, were not new created by Christ; and he does not speak of the new creation till <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18</a>. The creation "of the things that are in the heavens" (so Greek) includes the creation of the heavens themselves: the former are rather named, since the inhabitants are more noble than their dwellings. Heaven and earth and all that is m them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011">Ch1 29:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006">Neh 9:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006">Rev 10:6</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>thrones, or dominions--lordships: the thrones are the greater of the two. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>principalities, or powers--rather, "rules, or authorities": the former are stronger than the latter (compare Note, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021">Eph 1:21</a>). The latter pair refer to offices in respect to God's creatures: "thrones and dominions" express exalted relation to God, they being the chariots on which He rides displaying His glory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017">Psa 68:17</a>). The existence of various orders of angels is established by this passage. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>all things--Greek, "the whole universe of things." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>were--rather, to distinguish the Greek aorist, which precedes from the perfect tense here, "have been created." In the former case the creation was viewed as a past act at a point of time, or as done once for all; here it is viewed, not merely as one historic act of creation in the past, but as the permanent result now and eternally continuing.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>for him--as the grand End of creation; containing in Himself the reason why creation is at all, and why it is as it is [ALFORD]. He is the final cause as well as the efficient cause. LACHMANN'S punctuation of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15-18</a> is best, whereby "the first-born of every creature" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>) answers to "the first-born from the dead" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18</a>), the whole forming one sentence with the words ("All things were created by Him and for Him, and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist, and He is the Head of the body, the Church") intervening as a parenthesis. Thus Paul puts first, the origination by Him of the natural creation; secondly, of the new creation. The parenthesis falls into four clauses, two and two: the former two support the first assertion, "the first-born of every creature"; the latter two prepare us for "the first-born from the dead"'; the former two correspond to the latter two in their form--"All things by Him . . . and He is," and "By Him all things . . . and He is."

Translate as Greek, "And He Himself (the great HE) is (implying divine essential being) before all things," in time, as well as in dignity. Since He is before all things, He is before even time, that is, from eternity. Compare "the first-born of every creature" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>).

The same One who is the Head of all things and beings by creation, is also, by virtue of being "the first-born from the dead," and so "the first-fruits" of the new creation among men, the Head of the Church. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>who is--that is, in that He is the Beginning [ALFORD]. Rather, this is the beginning of a new paragraph. As the former paragraph, which related to His originating the physical creation, began with "Who is" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>); so this, which treats of His originating the new creation, begins with "who is"; a parenthesis preceding, which closes the former paragraph, that parenthesis (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016">Col 1:16</a>), including from "all things were created by Him," to "Head of the body, the Church." The head of kings and high priests was anointed, as the seat of the faculties, the fountain of dignity, and original of all the members (according to Hebrew etymology). So Jesus by His unction was designated as the Head of the body, the Church. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the beginning--namely, of the new creation, as of the old (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Pro 8:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001">Joh 1:1</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008">Rev 1:8</a>): the beginning of the Church of the first-born (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023">Heb 12:23</a>), as being Himself the "first-born from the dead" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023">Act 26:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020">Co1 15:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023">Co1 15:23</a>). Christ's primogeniture is threefold: (1) From eternity the "first-begotten" of the Father (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>); (2) As the first-born of His mother (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025">Mat 1:25</a>); (3) As the Head of the Church, mystically begotten of the Father, as it were to a new life, on the day of His resurrection, which is His "regeneration," even as His people's coming resurrection will be their "regeneration" (that is, the resurrection which was begun in the soul, extended to the body and to the whole creation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021">Rom 8:21-22</a>) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028">Mat 19:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033">Act 13:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005">Rev 1:5</a>). Sonship and resurrection are similarly connected (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036">Luk 20:36</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Rom 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023">Rom 8:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002">Jo1 3:2</a>). Christ by rising from the dead is the efficient cause (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022">Co1 15:22</a>), as having obtained the power, and the exemplary cause, as being the pattern (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013">Mic 2:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005">Rom 6:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021">Phi 3:21</a>), of our resurrection: the resurrection of "the Head" involves consequentially that of the members.

The Gnostics used the term "fulness," for the assemblage of emanations, or angelic powers, coming from God. The Spirit presciently by Paul warns the Church, that the true "fulness" dwells in Christ alone. This assigns the reason why Christ takes precedence of every creature (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a>). For two reasons Christ is Lord of the Church: (1) Because the fulness of the divine attributes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019">Col 1:19</a>) dwells in Him, and so He has the power to govern the universe; (2) Because (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</a>) what He has done for the Church gives Him the right to preside over it. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>should . . . dwell--as in a temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021">Joh 2:21</a>). This indwelling of the Godhead in Christ is the foundation of the reconciliation by Him [BENGEL]. Hence the "and" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</a>) connects as cause and effect the two things, the Godhead in Christ, and the reconciliation by Christ.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">col 1:20</a></font></span></p>The Greek order is, "And through Him (Christ) to reconcile again completely (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016">Eph 2:16</a>) all things (Greek, 'the whole universe of things') unto Himself (unto God the Father, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">Co2 5:19</a>), having made peace (God the Father having made peace) through the blood of His (Christ's) cross," that is, shed by Christ on the cross: the price and pledge of our reconciliation with God. The Scripture phrase, "God reconciles man to Himself," implies that He takes away by the blood of Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against man's being in union with God (compare Note, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018">Co2 5:18</a>). So the Septuagint, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004">Sa1 29:4</a>, "Wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master," that is, reconcile his master unto him by appeasing his wrath.

 <p>
 </p><p>by him--"through Him" (the instrumental agent in the new creation, as in the original creation): emphatically repeated, to bring the person of Christ, as the Head of both creations alike, into prominence. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>things in earth . . . in heaven--Good angels, in one sense, do not need reconciliation to God; fallen angels are excluded from it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006">Jde 1:6</a>). But probably redemption has effects on the world of spirits unknown to us. Of course, His reconciling us, and His reconciling them, must be by a different process, as He took not on Him the nature of angels, so as to offer a propitiation for them. But the effect of redemption on them, as He is their Head as well as ours, is that they are thereby brought nearer God, and so gain an increase of blessedness [ALFORD], and larger views of the love and wisdom of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010">Eph 3:10</a>). All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly "reconciled" from its enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018">Job 4:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015">Job 15:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005">Job 25:5</a>), is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled. Doubtless, too, man's fall, following on Satan's fall, is a segment of a larger circle of evil, so that the remedy of the former affects the standing of angels, from among whom Satan and his host fell. Angels thereby having seen the magnitude of sin, and the infinite cost of redemption, and the exclusion of the fallen angels from it, and the inability of any creature to stand morally in his own strength, are now put beyond the reach of falling. Thus BACON'S definition of Christ's Headship holds good: "The Head of redemption to man; the Head of preservation to angels." Some conjecture that Satan, when unfallen, ruled this earth and the pre-Adamic animal kingdom: hence his malice against man who succeeded to the lordship of this earth and its animals, and hence, too, his assumption of the form of a serpent, the subtlest of the animal tribes. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038">Luk 19:38</a> states expressly "peace in heaven" as the result of finished redemption, as "peace on earth" was the result of its beginning at Jesus' birth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014">Luk 2:14</a>). BENGEL explains the reconciliation to be that of not only God, but also angels, estranged from men because of man's enmity against God. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010">Eph 1:10</a> accords with this: This is true, but only part of the truth: so ALFORD'S view also is but part of the truth. An actual reconciliation or restoration of peace in heaven, as well as on earth, is expressed by Paul. As long as that blood of reconciliation was not actually shed, which is opposed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8-9</a>) to the accusations of Satan, but was only in promise, Satan could plead his right against men before God day and night (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010">Rev 12:10</a>); hence he was in heaven till the ban on man was broken (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018">Luk 10:18</a>). So here; the world of earth and heaven owe to Christ alone the restoration of harmony after the conflict and the subjugation of all things under one Head (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023">Heb 11:23</a>). Sin introduced discord not only on earth, but also in heaven, by the fall of demons; it brought into the abodes of holy angels, though not positive, yet privative loss, a retardation of their highest and most perfect development, harmonious gradation, and perfect consummation. Angels were no more able than men by themselves to overcome the peace disturbers, and cast out the devils; it is only "by," or "through HIM," and "the blood of HIS cross," that peace was restored even in heaven; it is only after Christ has obtained the victory fully and legally, that Michael (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007">Rev 12:7-10</a>) and his angels can cast out of heaven Satan and his demons (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015">Col 2:15</a>). Thus the point of Paul's argument against angel-worship is, that angels themselves, like men, wholly depend on Christ, the sole and true object of worship [AUBERLEN].

 </p><p>not moved away--by the false teachers. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the hope of the gospel-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018">Eph 1:18</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which ye have heard . . . which was preached to every creature . . . whereof I . . . am . . . a minister--Three arguments against their being "moved away from the Gospel": (1) Their having heard it; (2) The universality of the preaching of it; (3) Paul's ministry in it. For "to (Greek, 'in') every creature," the oldest manuscripts read, "in all creation." Compare "in all the world," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006">Col 1:6</a>; "all things . . . in earth," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</a> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015">Mar 16:15</a>): thus he implies that the Gospel from which he urges them not to be moved, has this mark of truth, namely, the universality of its announcement, which accords with the command and prophecy of Christ Himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014">Mat 24:14</a>). By "was preached," he means not merely "is being preached," but has been actually, as an accomplished fact, preached. PLINY, not many years subsequently, in his famous letter to the Emperor Trajan [Epistles, Book X., Epistle 97], writes, "Many of every age, rank, and sex, are being brought to trial. For the contagion of that superstition [Christianity] has spread over not only cities, but villages and the country." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>whereof I Paul am--rather as Greek, "was made a minister." Respect for me, the minister of this world-wide Gospel, should lead you not to be moved from it. Moreover (he implies), the Gospel which ye heard from Epaphras, your "minister" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007">Col 1:7</a>), is the same of which "I was made a minister" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025">Col 1:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007">Eph 3:7</a>): if you be moved from it, ye will desert the teaching of the recognized ministers of the Gospel for unauthorized false teachers.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">col 1:24</a></font></span></p>Who--The oldest manuscripts omit "who"; then translate, "Now I rejoice." Some very old manuscripts, and the best of the Latin versions, and Vulgate, read as English Version. To enhance the glory of Christ as paramount to all, he mentions his own sufferings for the Church of Christ. "Now" stands in contrast to "I was made," in the past time (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023">Col 1:23</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>for you--"on your behalf," that ye may be confirmed in resting solely on Christ (to the exclusion of angel-worship) by the glorification of Christ in my sufferings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001">Eph 3:1</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>fill up that which is behind--literally, "the deficiencies"--all that are lacking of the afflictions of Christ (compare Note, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005">Co2 1:5</a>). Christ is "afflicted in all His people's afflictions" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009">Isa 63:9</a>). "The Church is His body in which He is, dwells, lives, and therefore also suffers" [VITRINGA]. Christ was destined to endure certain afflictions in this figurative body, as well as in His literal; these were "that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ," which Paul "filled up." His own meritorious sufferings in expiation for sin were once for all completely filled up on the Cross. But His Church (His second Self) has her whole measure of afflictions fixed. The more Paul, a member, endured, the less remain for the rest of the Church to endure; the communion of saints thus giving them an interest in his sufferings. It is in reference to the Church's afflictions, which are "Christ's afflictions, that Paul here saith, "I fill up the deficiencies," or "what remain behind of the afflictions of Christ." She is afflicted to promote her growth in holiness, and her completeness in Christ. Not one suffering is lost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008">Psa 56:8</a>). All her members have thus a mutual interest in one another's sufferings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026">Co1 12:26</a>). But Rome's inference hence, is utterly false that the Church has a stock treasury of the merits and satisfactions of Christ and His apostles, out of which she may dispense indulgences; the context has no reference to sufferings in expiation of sin and productive of merit. Believers should regard their sufferings less in relation to themselves as individuals, and more as parts of a grand whole, carrying out God's perfect plan.

The mystery, once hidden, now revealed, is redemption for the whole Gentile world, as well as for the Jews, "Christ in you (Gentiles) the hope of glory" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027">Col 1:27</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>from ages--"from," according to ALFORD, refers to time, not "hidden from": from the time of the ages; still what is meant is that the mystery was hidden from the beings living in those "ages." The "ages" are the vast successive periods marked by successive orders of beings and stages of creation. Greek, "Ãons," a word used by the Gnostics for angelic beings emanating from God. The Spirit by Paul presciently, in opposition to Gnostic error already beginning (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18</a>), teaches, that the mystery of redemption was hidden in God's purposes in Christ, alike from the angelic beings (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010">Eph 3:10</a>) of the pre-Adamic "ages," and from the subsequent human "generations." Translate as Greek, "the ages . . . the generations."

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">col 1:27</a></font></span></p>would--rather as Greek, "willed," or "was pleased to make known." He resolves all into God's good pleasure and will, that man should not glory save in God's grace. 
 <p>
 </p><p>what--How full and inexhaustible! 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the riches of the glory of this mystery--He accumulates phrase on phrase to enhance the greatness of the blessing in Christ bestowed by God on the Gentiles. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</a>, "all the treasures" of wisdom; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008">Eph 3:8</a>, "the unsearchable riches of Christ"; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007">Eph 1:7</a>, "riches of His grace." "The glory of this mystery" must be the glory which this once hidden, and now revealed, truth makes you Gentiles partakers of, partly now, but mainly when Christ shall come (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004">Col 3:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017">Rom 8:17-18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018">Eph 1:18</a>). This sense is proved by the following: "Christ in you the hope of the (so Greek) glory." The lower was the degradation of you Gentiles, the higher is the richness of the glory to which the mystery revealed now raises you. You were "without Christ, and having no hope" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</a>). Now you have "Christ in you the hope of the glory" just mentioned. ALFORD translates, "Christ among you," to answer to "this mystery among the Gentiles." But the whole clause, "Christ IN you (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017">Eph 3:17</a>) the hope of glory," answers to "this mystery," and not to the whole sentence, "this mystery among the Gentiles." What is made known "among you Gentiles" is, "Christ in you (now by faith as your hidden life, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003">Col 3:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020">Gal 2:20</a>) the hope of glory" (your manifested life). The contrast (antithesis) between "CHRIST IN YOU" now as your hidden life, and "the hope of glory" hereafter to be manifested, requires this translation.

The same Greek word is used of Epaphras (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012">Col 4:12</a>), "laboring fervently for you in prayers": literally, "agonizing," "striving as in the agony of a contest." So Jesus in Gethsemane when praying (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044">Luk 22:44</a>): so "strive" (the same Greek word, "agonize"), <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024">Luk 13:24</a>. So Jacob "wrestled" in prayer (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024">Gen 32:24-29</a>).
