Continuation of the longing for the dawn of the Messiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017">Sol 2:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006">Psa 130:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002">Mal 4:2</a>). The spiritual desertion here (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017">Sol 2:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005">Sol 3:5</a>) is not due to indifference, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002">Sol 5:2-8</a>. "As nights and dews are better for flowers than a continual sun, so Christ's absence (at times) giveth sap to humility, and putteth an edge on hunger, and furnisheth a fair field to faith to put forth itself" [RUTHERFORD]. Contrast <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013">Sol 1:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006">Psa 30:6-7</a>.

Four times (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001">Sol 3:1-4</a>) she calls Jesus Christ, "Him whom my soul loveth," designating Him as absent; language of desire: "He loved me," would be language of present fruition (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005">Rev 1:5</a>). In questioning the watchmen (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003">Sol 3:3</a>), she does not even name Him, so full is her heart of Him. Having found Him at dawn (for throughout He is the morning), she charges the daughters not to abridge by intrusion the period of His stay. Compare as to the thoughtful seeking for Jesus Christ in the time of John the Baptist, in vain at first, but presently after successful (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015">Luk 3:15-22</a>; John 1:19-34).

"An honest resolution is often to (the doing of) duty, like a needle that draws the thread after it" [DURHAM]. Not a mere wish, that counts not the cost--to leave her easy bed, and wander in the dark night seeking Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#004">Pro 13:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#030">Mat 21:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027">Luk 14:27-33</a>).

So, the assemblies of worshippers (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002">Sol 8:2-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#020">Pro 1:20-23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025">Heb 10:25</a>). She had in her first awakening shrunk from them, seeking Jesus Christ alone; but she was desired to seek the footsteps of the flock (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008">Sol 1:8</a>), so now in her second trial she goes forth to them of herself. "The more the soul grows in grace, and the less it leans on ordinances, the more it prizes and profits by them" [MOODY STUART] (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016">Psa 73:16-17</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">sol 3:4</a></font></span></p>Jesus Christ is generally "found" near the watchmen and means of grace; but they are not Himself; the star that points to Beth-lehem is not the Sun that has risen there; she hastens past the guideposts to the goal [MOODY STUART]. Not even angels could satisfy Mary, instead of Jesus Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011">Joh 20:11-16</a>).

"As a little weeping child will hold its mother fast, not because it is stronger than she, but because her bowels constrain her not to leave it; so Jesus Christ yearning over the believer cannot go, because He will not" [DURHAM]. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004">Sol 1:4</a> it is He who leads the bride into His chambers; here it is she who leads Him into her mother's. There are times when the grace of Jesus Christ seems to draw us to Him; and others, when we with strong cries draw Him to us and ours. In the East one large apartment often serves for the whole family; so the bride here speaks of her mother's apartment and her own together. The mention of the "mother" excludes impropriety, and imparts the idea of heavenly love, pure as a sister's, while ardent as a bride's; hence the frequent title, "my sister--spouse." Our mother after the Spirit, is the Church, the new Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005">Joh 3:5-8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019">Gal 4:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026">Gal 4:26</a>); for her we ought to pray continually (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014">Eph 3:14-19</a>), also for the national Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006">Isa 62:6-7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001">Rom 10:1</a>), also for the human family, which is our mother and kindred after the flesh; these our mother's children have evilly treated us (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006">Sol 1:6</a>); but, like our Father, we are to return good for evil (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44-45</a>), and so bring Jesus Christ home to them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012">Pe1 2:12</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>pillars of smoke--from the perfumes burned around Him and His bride. Image from Israel and the tabernacle (answering to "bed," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007">Sol 3:7</a>) marching through the desert with the pillar of smoke by day and fire by night (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020">Exo 14:20</a>), and the pillars of smoke ascending from the altars of incense and of atonement; so Jesus Christ's righteousness, atonement, and ever-living intercession. Balaam, the last representative of patriarchism, was required to curse the Jewish Church, just as it afterwards would not succumb to Christianity without a struggle (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041">Num 22:41</a>), but he had to bless in language like that here (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005">Num 24:5-6</a>). Angels too joyfully ask the same question, when Jesus Christ with the tabernacle of His body (answering to "His bed," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007">Sol 3:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a>, "dwelt," Greek "tabernacled," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021">Joh 2:21</a>) ascends into heaven (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008">Psa 24:8-10</a>); also when they see His glorious bride with Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psa 68:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013">Rev 7:13-17</a>). Encouragement to her; amid the darkest trials (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001">Sol 3:1</a>), she is still on the road to glory (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011">Sol 3:11</a>) in a palanquin "paved with love" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010">Sol 3:10</a>); she is now in soul spiritually "coming," exhaling the sweet graces, faith, love, joy, peace, prayer, and praise; (the fire is lighted within, the "smoke" is seen without, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013">Act 4:13</a>); it is in the desert of trial (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001">Sol 3:1-3</a>) she gets them; she is the "merchant" buying from Jesus Christ without money or price (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018">Rev 3:18</a>); just as myrrh and frankincense are got, not in Egypt, but in the Arabian sands and the mountains of Palestine. Hereafter she shall "come" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006">Sol 3:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011">Sol 3:11</a>) in a glorified body, too (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021">Phi 3:21</a>). Historically, Jesus Christ returning from the wilderness, full of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001">Luk 4:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014">Luk 4:14</a>). The same, "Who is this," &amp;c. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005">Isa 63:5</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>bottom--rather, "the back for resting or reclining on" (Vulgate and Septuagint) [MAURER]. So the floor and mercy seat, the resting-place of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Psa 132:14</a>) in the temple, was gold (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#030">Kg1 6:30</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>covering--rather, "seat," as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#009">Lev 15:9</a>. Hereafter the saints shall share His seat (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021">Rev 3:21</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>purple--the veil of the holiest, partly purple, and the purple robe put on Jesus Christ, accord with English Version, "covering." "Purple" (including scarlet and crimson) is the emblem of royalty, and of His blood; typified by the passover lamb's blood, and the wine when the twelve sat or reclined at the Lord's table. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>paved--translated, like mosaic pavement, with the various acts and promises of love of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017">Zep 3:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008">Jo1 4:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016">Jo1 4:16</a>), in contrast with the tables of stone in the "midst" of the ark, covered with writings of stern command (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013">Joh 19:13</a>); this is all grace and love to believers, who answer to "the daughters of Jerusalem" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017">Joh 1:17</a>). The exterior silver and gold, cedar, purple, and guards, may deter, but when the bride enters within, she rests on a pavement of love.

"His mother," that so crowned Him, is the human race, for He is "the Son of man," not merely the son of Mary. The same mother reconciled to Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#050">Mat 12:50</a>), as the Church, travails in birth for souls, which she presents to Him as a crown (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001">Phi 4:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010">Rev 4:10</a>).

MOODY STUART observes as to this Canticle (Son. 3:6-5:1), the center of the Book, these characteristics: (1) The bridegroom takes the chief part, whereas elsewhere the bride is the chief speaker. (2) Elsewhere He is either "King" or "Solomon"; here He is twice called "King Solomon." The bride is six times here called the "spouse"; never so before or after; also "sister" four times, and, except in the first verse of the next Canticle [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002">Sol 5:2</a>], nowhere else. (3) He and she are never separate; no absence, no complaint, which abound elsewhere, are in this Canticle.
