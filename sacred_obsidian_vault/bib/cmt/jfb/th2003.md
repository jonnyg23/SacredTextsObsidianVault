 <p>
 </p><p>Finally--literally, "As to what remains." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>may have free course--literally, "may run"; spread rapidly without a drag on the wheels of its course. That the new-creating word may "run," as "swiftly" as the creative word at the first (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015">Psa 147:15</a>). The opposite is the word of God being "bound" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009">Ti2 2:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>glorified--by sinners accepting it (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048">Act 13:48</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023">Gal 1:23-24</a>). Contrast "evil spoken of" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014">Pe1 4:14</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as it is with you-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006">Th1 1:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010">Th1 4:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011">Th1 5:11</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">th2 3:2</a></font></span></p>that we . . . be delivered from unreasonable . . . men--literally, men out of place, inept, unseemly: out of the way bad: more than ordinarily bad. An undesigned coincidence with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005">Act 18:5-9</a>. Paul was now at Corinth, where the JEWS "opposed themselves" to his preaching: in answer to his prayers and those of his converts at Thessalonica and elsewhere, "the Lord, in vision," assured him of exemption from "the hurt," and of success in bringing in "much people." On the unreasonable, out-of-the way perversity of the Jews, as known to the Thessalonians, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015">Th1 2:15-16</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>have not faith--or as Greek, "the faith" of the Christian: the only antidote to what is "unreasonable and wicked." The Thessalonians, from their ready acceptance of the Gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005">Th1 1:5-6</a>), might think "all" would similarly receive it; but the Jews were far from having such a readiness to believe the truth.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">th2 3:3</a></font></span></p>faithful--alluding to "faith" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002">Th2 3:2</a>) : though many will not believe, the Lord (other very old manuscripts read "God") is still to be believed in as faithful to His promises (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024">Th1 5:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013">Ti2 2:13</a>). Faith on the part of man answers to faithfulness on the part of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>stablish you--as he had prayed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017">Th2 2:17</a>). Though it was on himself that wicked men were making their onset, he turns away from asking the Thessalonians' prayers for HIS deliverance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002">Th2 3:2</a> : so unselfish was he, even in religion), to express his assurance of THEIR establishment in the faith, and preservation from evil. This assurance thus exactly answers to his prayer for them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017">Th2 2:17</a>), "Our Lord . . . stablish you in every good word and work." He has before his mind the Lord's Prayer, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"; where, as here, the translation may be, "from the evil one"; the great hinderer of "every good word and work." Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019">Mat 13:19</a>, "the wicked one."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">th2 3:4</a></font></span></p>we have confidence in the Lord--as "faithful" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003">Th2 3:3</a>). Have confidence in no man when left to himself [BENGEL]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>that ye both do--Some of the oldest manuscripts insert a clause, "that ye both have done" before, "and are doing, and will do." He means the majority by "ye," not all of them (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011">Th2 3:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003">Th2 1:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006">Th1 3:6</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">th2 3:5</a></font></span></p>If "the Lord" be here the Holy Ghost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017">Co2 3:17</a>), the three Persons of the Trinity will occur in this verse. 
 <p>
 </p><p>love of God--love to God. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>patient waiting for Christ--rather as Greek, "the patience (endurance) of Christ," namely, which Christ showed [ALFORD] (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">Th2 2:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</a>). ESTIUS, however, supports English Version (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009">Rev 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010">Rev 3:10</a>). At all events, this grace, "patience," or persevering endurance, is connected with the "hope" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010">Th1 1:10</a>) of Christ's coming. In ALFORD'S translation we may compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001">Heb 12:1-2</a>, "Run with patience (endurance) . . . looking to JESUS . . . who, for the joy that was before Him, endured the cross"; so WE are to endure, as looking for the hope to be realized at His coming (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036">Heb 10:36-37</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">th2 3:6</a></font></span></p>we command you--Hereby he puts to a particular test their obedience in general to his commands, which obedience he had recognized in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004">Th2 3:4</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>withdraw--literally, "to furl the sails"; as we say, to steer clear of (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014">Th2 3:14</a>). Some had given up labor as though the Lord's day was immediately coming. He had enjoined mild censure of such in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014">Th1 5:14</a>, "Warn . . . the unruly"; but now that the mischief had become more confirmed, he enjoins stricter discipline, namely, withdrawal from their company (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011">Co1 5:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010">Jo2 1:10-11</a>): not a formal sentence of excommunication, such as was subsequently passed on more heinous offenders (as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005">Co1 5:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020">Ti1 1:20</a>). He says "brother," that is, professing Christian; for in the case of unprofessing heathen, believers needed not be so strict (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010">Co1 5:10-13</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>disorderly--Paul plainly would not have sanctioned the order of Mendicant Friars, who reduce such a "disorderly" and lazy life to a system. Call it not an order, but a burden to the community (BENGEL, alluding to the Greek, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008">Th2 3:8</a>, for "be chargeable," literally, "be a burden"). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the tradition--the oral instruction which he had given to them when present (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010">Th2 3:10</a>), and subsequently committed to writing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011">Th1 4:11-12</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which he received of us--Some oldest manuscripts read, "ye received"; others, "they received." The English Version reading has no very old authority.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007">2 Thessalonians 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">th2 3:7</a></font></span></p>how ye ought to follow us--how ye ought to live so as to "imitate (so the Greek for 'follow') us" (compare Notes, see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001">Co1 11:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006">Th1 1:6</a>).
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">th2 3:8</a></font></span></p>eat any man's bread--Greek, "eat bread from any man," that is, live at anyone's expense. Contrast <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012">Th2 3:12</a>, "eat THEIR OWN bread." 
 <p>
 </p><p>wrought-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034">Act 20:34</a>). In both Epistles they state they maintained themselves by labor; but in this second Epistle they do so in order to offer themselves herein as an example to the idle; whereas, in the first, their object in doing so is to vindicate themselves from all imputation of mercenary motives in preaching the Gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005">Th1 2:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009">Th1 2:9</a>) [EDMUNDS]. They preached gratuitously though they might have claimed maintenance from their converts. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>labour and travail--"toil and hardship" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009">Th1 2:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>night and day--scarcely allowing time for repose. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>chargeable--Greek, "a burden," or "burdensome." The Philippians did not regard it as a burden to contribute to his support (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015">Phi 4:15-16</a>), sending to him while he was in this very Thessalonica (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#015">Act 16:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#034">Act 16:34</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#040">Act 16:40</a>). Many Thessalonians, doubtless, would have felt it a privilege to contribute, but as he saw some idlers among them who would have made a pretext of his example to justify themselves, he waived his right. His reason for the same course at Corinth was to mark how different were his aims from those of the false teachers who sought their own lucre (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009">Co2 11:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012">Co2 11:12-13</a>). It is at the very time and place of writing these Epistles that Paul is expressly said to have wrought at tent-making with Aquila (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003">Act 18:3</a>); an undesigned coincidence.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#009">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">th2 3:9</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004">Co1 9:4-6</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006">Gal 6:6</a>.)
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">th2 3:10</a></font></span></p>For even--Translate, "For also." We not only set you the example, but gave a positive "command." 
 <p>
 </p><p>commanded--Greek imperfect, "We were commanding"; we kept charge of you. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>would not work--Greek, "is unwilling to work." BENGEL makes this to be the argument: not that such a one is to have his food withdrawn from him by others; but he proves from the necessity of eating the necessity of working; using this pleasantry, Let him who will not work show himself an angel, that is, do without food as the angels do (but since he cannot do without food, then he ought to be not unwilling to work). It seems to me simpler to take it as a punishment of the idle. Paul often quotes good adages current among the people, stamping them with inspired approval. In the Hebrew, "Bereshith Rabba," the same saying is found; and in the book Zeror, "He who will not work before the sabbath, must not eat on the sabbath."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">th2 3:11</a></font></span></p>busy bodies--In the Greek the similarity of sound marks the antithesis, "Doing none of their own business, yet overdoing in the business of others." Busy about everyone's business but their own. "Nature abhors a vacuum"; so if not doing one's own business, one is apt to meddle with his neighbor's business. Idleness is the parent of busybodies (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013">Ti1 5:13</a>). Contrast <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011">Th1 4:11</a>.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">th2 3:12</a></font></span></p>by--The oldest manuscripts read, "IN the Lord Jesus." So the Greek, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001">Th1 4:1</a>, implying the sphere wherein such conduct is appropriate and consistent. "We exhort you thus, as ministers IN Christ, exhorting our people IN Christ." 
 <p>
 </p><p>with quietness--quiet industry; laying aside restless, bustling, intermeddling officiousness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011">Th2 3:11</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>their own--bread earned by themselves, not another's bread (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008">Th2 3:8</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#013">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">th2 3:13</a></font></span></p>be not weary--The oldest manuscripts read, "Be not cowardly in"; do not be wanting in strenuousness in doing well. EDMUNDS explains it: Do not culpably neglect to do well, namely, with patient industry do your duty in your several callings. In contrast to the "disorderly, not-working busybodies" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011">Th2 3:11</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009">Gal 6:9</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">th2 3:14</a></font></span></p>note that man--mark him in your own mind as one to be avoided (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">Th2 3:6</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>that he may be ashamed--Greek, "made to turn and look into himself, and so be put to shame." Feeling himself shunned by godly brethren, he may become ashamed of his course.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">th2 3:15</a></font></span></p>admonish him as a brother--not yet excommunicated (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017">Lev 19:17</a>). Do not shun him in contemptuous silence, but tell him why he is so avoided (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015">Mat 18:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014">Th1 5:14</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">th2 3:16</a></font></span></p>Lord of peace--Jesus Christ. The same title is given to Him as to the Father, "the GOD of peace" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033">Rom 15:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020">Rom 16:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011">Co2 13:11</a>). An appropriate title in the prayer here, where the harmony of the Christian community was liable to interruption from the "disorderly." The Greek article requires the translation, "Give you the peace" which it is "His to give." "Peace" outward and inward, here and hereafter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017">Rom 14:17</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>always--unbroken, not changing with outward circumstances. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>by all means--Greek, "in every way." Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "in every place"; thus he prays for their peace in all times ("always") and places. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Lord be with you all--May He bless you not only with peace, but also with His presence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mat 28:20</a>). Even the disorderly brethren (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015">Th2 3:15</a>, "a brother") are included in this prayer.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">th2 3:17</a></font></span></p>The Epistle was written by an amanuensis (perhaps Silas or Timothy), and only the closing salutation written by Paul's "own hand" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022">Rom 16:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021">Co1 16:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018">Col 4:18</a>). Wherever Paul does not subjoin this autograph salutation, we may presume he wrote the whole Epistle himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011">Gal 6:11</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>which--which autograph salutation. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the token--to distinguish genuine Epistles from spurious ones put forth in my name (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002">Th2 2:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in every epistle--Some think he signed his name to every Epistle with his own hand; but as there is no trace of this in any manuscripts of all the Epistles, it is more likely that he alludes to his writing with his own hand in closing every Epistle, even in those Epistles (Romans, Second Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, First Thessalonians) wherein he does not specify his having done so. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>so I write--so I sign my name: this is a specimen of my handwriting, by which to distinguish my geniune letters from forgeries.

 <p>
 </p><p>Amen--omitted in the oldest manuscripts It was doubtless the response of the congregation after hearing the Epistle read publicly; hence it crept into copies.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>The Subscription is spurious, as the Epistle was written not "from Athens," but from Corinth.
