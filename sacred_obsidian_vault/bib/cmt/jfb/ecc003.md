 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ecc 3:1</a></font></span></p>(Ecc. 3:1-22)
 <p>
 </p><p>Man has his appointed cycle of seasons and vicissitudes, as the sun, wind, and water (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#005">Ecc 1:5-7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>purpose--as there is a fixed "season" in God's "purposes" (for example, He has fixed the "time" when man is "to be born," and "to die," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002">Ecc 3:2</a>), so there is a lawful "time" for man to carry out his "purposes" and inclinations. God does not condemn, but approves of, the use of earthly blessings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012">Ecc 3:12</a>); it is the abuse that He condemns, the making them the chief end (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031">Co1 7:31</a>). The earth, without human desires, love, taste, joy, sorrow, would be a dreary waste, without water; but, on the other hand, the misplacing and excess of them, as of a flood, need control. Reason and revelation are given to control them.

 <p>
 </p><p>plant--A man can no more reverse the times and order of "planting," and of "digging up," and transplanting, than he can alter the times fixed for his "birth" and "death." To try to "plant" out of season is vanity, however good in season; so to make earthly things the chief end is vanity, however good they be in order and season. GILL takes it, not so well, figuratively (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007">Jer 18:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#009">Jer 18:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015">Amo 9:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013">Mat 15:13</a>).

To heal spiritually, before the sinner feels his wound, would be "out of time," and so injurious. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p>

To be careful is right in its place, but not when it comes between us and Jesus Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040">Luk 10:40-42</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ecc 3:9</a></font></span></p>But these earthly pursuits, while lawful in their season, are "unprofitable" when made by man, what God never intended them to be, the chief good. Solomon had tried to create an artificial forced joy, at times when he ought rather to have been serious; the result, therefore, of his labor to be happy, out of God's order, was disappointment. "A time to plant" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002">Ecc 3:2</a>) refers to his planting (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005">Ecc 2:5</a>); "laugh" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#004">Ecc 3:4</a>), to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001">Ecc 2:1-2</a>; "his mirth," "laughter"; "build up," "gather stones" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#003">Ecc 3:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005">Ecc 3:5</a>), to his "building" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004">Ecc 2:4</a>); "embrace," "love," to his "princess" (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008">Ecc 2:8</a>); "get" (perhaps also "gather," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005">Ecc 3:5-6</a>), to his "gathering" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008">Ecc 2:8</a>). All these were of "no profit," because not in God's time and order of bestowing happiness.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010">Ecclesiastes 3:10</a></p>

 </p><p>
 </p><p>so that--that is, but in such a manner that man only sees a portion, not the whole "from beginning to end" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017">Ecc 8:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014">Job 26:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033">Rom 11:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004">Rev 15:4</a>). PARKHURST, for "world," translates: "Yet He hath put obscurity in the midst of them," literally, "a secret," so man's mental dimness of sight as to the full mystery of God's works. So HOLDEN and WEISS. This incapacity for "finding out" (comprehending) God's work is chiefly the fruit of the fall. The worldling ever since, not knowing God's time and order, labors in vain, because out of time and place.

Man cannot fully comprehend them, but he ought joyfully to receive ("rejoice in") God's gifts, and "do good" with them to himself and to others. This is never out of season (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009">Gal 6:9-10</a>). Not sensual joy and self-indulgence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004">Phi 4:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016">Jam 4:16-17</a>).

The event of man's labors depends wholly on God's immutable purpose. Man's part, therefore, is to do and enjoy every earthly thing in its proper season (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012">Ecc 3:12-13</a>), not setting aside God's order, but observing deep reverence towards God; for the mysteriousness and unchangeableness of God's purposes are designed to lead "man to fear before Him." Man knows not the event of each act: otherwise he would think himself independent of God.

 <p>
 </p><p>requireth that . . . past--After many changes, God's law requires the return of the same cycle of events, as in the past, literally, "that which is driven on." The Septuagint and Syriac translate: "God requireth (that is, avengeth) the persecuted man"; a transition to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016">Ecc 3:16-17</a>. The parallel clauses of the verse support English Version.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">ecc 3:16</a></font></span></p>Here a difficulty is suggested. If God "requires" events to move in their perpetual cycle, why are the wicked allowed to deal unrighteously in the place where injustice ought least of all to be; namely, "the place of judgment" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001">Jer 12:1</a>)?
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">ecc 3:17</a></font></span></p>Solution of it. There is a coming judgment in which God will vindicate His righteous ways. The sinner's "time" of his unrighteous "work" is short. God also has His "time" and "work" of judgment; and, meanwhile, is overruling, for good at last, what seems now dark. Man cannot now "find out" the plan of God's ways (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011">Ecc 3:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002">Psa 97:2</a>). If judgment instantly followed every sin, there would be no scope for free will, faith, and perseverance of saints in spite of difficulties. The previous darkness will make the light at last the more glorious. 
 <p>
 </p><p>there-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017">Job 3:17-19</a>) in eternity, in the presence of the Divine Judge, opposed to the "there," in the human place of judgment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016">Ecc 3:16</a>): so "from thence" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024">Gen 49:24</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">ecc 3:18</a></font></span></p>estate--The estate of fallen man is so ordered (these wrongs are permitted), that God might "manifest," that is, thereby prove them, and that they might themselves see their mortal frailty, like that of the beasts. 
 <p>
 </p><p>sons of men--rather, "sons of Adam," a phrase used for "fallen men." The toleration of injustice until the judgment is designed to "manifest" men's characters in their fallen state, to see whether the oppressed will bear themselves aright amidst their wrongs, knowing that the time is short, and there is a coming judgment. The oppressed share in death, but the comparison to "beasts" applies especially to the ungodly oppressors (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012">Psa 49:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020">Psa 49:20</a>). They too need to be "manifested" ("proved"), whether, considering that they must soon die as the "beasts," and fearing the judgment to come, they will repent (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027">Dan 4:27</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">ecc 3:19</a></font></span></p>Literally, "For the sons of men (Adam) are a mere chance, as also the beast is a mere chance." These words can only be the sentiments of the skeptical oppressors. God's delay in judgment gives scope for the "manifestation" of their infidelity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011">Ecc 8:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019">Psa 55:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003">Pe2 3:3</a>,4). They are "brute beasts," morally (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018">Ecc 3:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010">Jde 1:10</a>); and they end by maintaining that man, physically, has no pre-eminence over the beast, both alike being "fortuities." Probably this was the language of Solomon himself in his apostasy. He answers it in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021">Ecc 3:21</a>. If <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019">Ecc 3:19-20</a> be his words, they express only that as regards liability to death, excluding the future judgment, as the skeptic oppressors do, man is on a level with the beast. Life is "vanity," if regarded independently of religion. But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021">Ecc 3:21</a> points out the vast difference between them in respect to the future destiny; also (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017">Ecc 3:17</a>) beasts have no "judgment" to come.

The Hebrew expresses the difference strongly, "The spirit of man that ascends, it belongeth to on high; but the spirit of the beast that descends, it belongeth to below, even to the earth." Their destinations and proper element differ utterly [WEISS].
