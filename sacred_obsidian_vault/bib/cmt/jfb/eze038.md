 <p>
 </p><p>Gog--the prince of the land of Magog. The title was probably a common one of the kings of the country, as "Pharaoh" in Egypt. Chakan was the name given by the Northern Asiatics to their king, and is still a title of the Turkish sultan: "Gog" may be a contraction of this. In Ezekiel's time a horde of northern Asiatics, termed by the Greeks "Scythians," and probably including the Moschi and Tibareni, near the Caucasus, here ("Meshech . . . Tubal") undertook an expedition against Egypt [HERODOTUS, 1.103-106]. These names might be adopted by Ezekiel from the historical fact familiar to men at the time, as ideal titles for the great last anti-Christian confederacy. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Magog-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002">Gen 10:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005">Ch1 1:5</a>). The name of a land belonging to Japheth's posterity. Maha, in Sanskrit, means "land." Gog is the ideal political head of the region. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008">Rev 20:8</a>, Gog and Magog are two peoples. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the chief prince--rather, "prince of Rosh," or "Rhos" [Septuagint]. The Scythian Tauri in the Crimea were so called. The Araxes also was called "Rhos." The modern Russians may have hence assumed their name, as Moscow and Tobolsk from Meshech and Tubal, though their proper ancient name was Slavi, or Wends. HENGSTENBERG supports English Version, as "Rosh" is not found in the Bible. "Magog was Gog's original kingdom, though he acquired also Meshech and Tubal, so as to be called their chief prince."

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008">Ezekiel 38:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">eze 38:8</a></font></span></p>thou shall be visited--in wrath, by God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006">Isa 29:6</a>). Probably there is allusion to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021">Isa 24:21-22</a>, "The host of the high ones . . . shall be gathered . . . as prisoners . . . in me pit . . . and after many days shall they be visited." I therefore prefer English Version to GROTIUS rendering, "Thou shalt get the command" of the expedition. The "after many days" is defined by "in the latter years," that is, in the times just before the coming of Messiah, namely, under Antiochus, before His first coming; under Antichrist, before His second coming. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the mountains of Israel . . . always waste--that is, waste during the long period of the captivity, the earnest of the much longer period of Judea's present desolation (to which the language "always waste" more fully applies). This marks the impious atrocity of the act, to assail God's people, who had only begun to recover from their protracted calamities. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but it is brought . . . and they shall dwell--rather, "And they (the Israelites) were brought . . . dwelt safely" [FAIRBAIRN]. English Version means, "Against Israel, which has been waste, but which (that is, whose people) is now (at the time of the invasion) brought forth out of the nations where they were dispersed, and shall be found by the invader dwelling securely, so as to seem an easy prey to him."

So, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005">Eze 5:5</a>, Israel is said to be set "in the midst of the nations"; not physically, but morally, a central position for being a blessing to the world: so (as the favored or "beloved city," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009">Rev 20:9</a>) an object of envy. GROTIUS translates, "In the height of the land" (so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008">Eze 38:8</a>), "the mountains of Israel," Israel being morally elevated above the rest of the world.

God is represented as addressing Gog at the time of his assault; therefore, the "old time" is the time long prior, when Ezekiel uttered these prophecies; so, he also, as well as Daniel (Dan. 11:1-45) and Zechariah (Zec. 14:1-21) are included among "the prophets of Israel" here.
