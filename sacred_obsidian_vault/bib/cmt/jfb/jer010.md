 <p>
 </p><p>Israel--the Jews, the surviving representatives of the nation.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002">Jeremiah 10:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jer 10:2</a></font></span></p>EICHORN thinks the reference here to be to some celestial portent which had appeared at that time, causing the Jews' dismay. Probably the reference is general, namely, to the Chaldeans, famed as astrologers, through contact with whom the Jews were likely to fall into the same superstition. 
 <p>
 </p><p>way--the precepts or ordinances (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003">Lev 18:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002">Act 9:2</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>signs of heaven--The Gentiles did not acknowledge a Great First Cause: many thought events depended on the power of the stars, which some, as PLATO, thought to be endued with spirit and reason. All heavenly phenomena, eclipses, comets, &amp;c., are included. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>one cutteth a tree, &amp;c.--rather, "It (that which they busy themselves about: a sample of their 'customs') is a tree cut out of the forest" [MAURER].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004">Jeremiah 10:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jer 10:4</a></font></span></p>fasten . . . move not--that is, that it may stand upright without risk of falling, which the god (!) would do, if left to itself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007">Isa 41:7</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005">Jeremiah 10:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jer 10:5</a></font></span></p>upright--or, "They are of turned work, resembling a palm tree" [MAURER]. The point of comparison between the idol and the palm is in the pillar-like uprightness of the latter, it having no branches except at the top. 
 <p>
 </p><p>speak not-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#005">Psa 115:5</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cannot go--that is, walk (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007">Psa 115:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001">Isa 46:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007">Isa 46:7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>neither . . . do good-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023">Isa 41:23</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006">Jeremiah 10:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jer 10:6</a></font></span></p>none--literally, "no particle of nothing": nothing whatever; the strongest possible denial (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011">Exo 15:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008">Psa 86:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010">Psa 86:10</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007">Jeremiah 10:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jer 10:7</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004">Rev 15:4</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>to thee doth it appertain--to Thee it properly belongs, namely, that Thou shouldest be "feared" (taken out of the previous "fear Thee") (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027">Eze 21:27</a>). He alone is the becoming object of worship. To worship any other is unseemly and an infringement of His inalienable prerogative. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>none--nothing whatever (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006">Jer 10:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006">Psa 89:6</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008">Jeremiah 10:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jer 10:8</a></font></span></p>altogether--rather, "all alike" [MAURER]. Even the so-called "wise" men (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007">Jer 10:7</a>) of the Gentiles are on a level with the brutes and "foolish," namely, because they connive at the popular idolatry (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021">Rom 1:21-28</a>). Therefore, in Daniel and Revelation, the world power is represented under a bestial form. Man divests himself of his true humanity, and sinks to the level of the brute, when he severs his connection with God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008">Psa 115:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008">Jon 2:8</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>stock is a doctrine of vanities--The stock (put for the worship of all idols whatever, made out of a stock) speaks for itself that the whole theory of idolatry is vanity (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009">Isa 44:9-11</a>). CASTALIO translates, "the very wood itself confuting the vanity" (of the idol).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#009">Jeremiah 10:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jer 10:9</a></font></span></p>Everything connected with idols is the result of human effort. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Silver spread--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022">Isa 30:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019">Isa 40:19</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Tarshish--Tartessus, in Spain, famed for precious metals. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Uphaz-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005">Dan 10:5</a>). As the Septuagint in the Syrian Hexapla in the Margin, THEODOTUS, the Syrian and Chaldee versions have "Ophir," GESENIUS thinks "Uphaz" a colloquial corruption (one letter only being changed) for "Ophir." Ophir, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#029">Gen 10:29</a>, is mentioned among Arabian countries. Perhaps Malacca is the country meant, the natives of which still call their gold mines Ophirs. HEEREN thinks Ophir the general name for the rich countries of the south, on the Arabian, African, and Indian coasts; just as our term, East Indies. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>cunning--skilful.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010">Jeremiah 10:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jer 10:10</a></font></span></p>true God--literally, "God Jehovah is truth"; not merely true, that is, veracious, but truth in the reality of His essence, as opposed to the "vanity" or emptiness which all idols are (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003">Jer 10:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008">Jer 10:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015">Jer 10:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003">Ch2 15:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005">Psa 31:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020">Jo1 5:20</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>living God-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026">Joh 5:26</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017">Ti1 6:17</a>). He hath life in Himself which no creature has. All else "live in Him" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Act 17:28</a>). In contrast to dead idols. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>everlasting-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016">Psa 10:16</a>). In contrast to the temporary existence of all other objects of worship.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#011">Jeremiah 10:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jer 10:11</a></font></span></p>This verse is in Chaldee, Jeremiah supplying his countrymen with a formula of reply to Chaldee idolaters in the tongue most intelligible to the latter. There may be also derision intended in imitating their barbarous dialect. ROSENMULLER objects to this view, that not merely the words put in the mouths of the Israelites, but Jeremiah's own introductory words, "Thus shall ye say to them," are in Chaldee, and thinks it to be a marginal gloss. But it is found in all the oldest versions. It was an old Greek saying: "Whoever thinks himself a god besides the one God, let him make another world" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005">Psa 96:5</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>shall perish-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018">Isa 2:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002">Zac 13:2</a>).

Thus the parallel, "confounded by the graven image," corresponds (so <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#017">Jer 51:17</a>). Others not so well translate, "without knowledge," namely, of God (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017">Isa 42:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#016">Isa 45:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006">Hos 4:6</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>rod of his inheritance--The portion marked off as His inheritance by the measuring rod (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021">Eze 48:21</a>). As He is their portion, so are they His portion (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009">Deu 32:9</a>). A reciprocal tie (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#019">Jer 51:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002">Psa 74:2</a>, Margin).

Prepare for migrating as captives to Babylon. The address is to Jerusalem, as representative of the whole people. 
 <p>
 </p><p>inhabitant of the fortress--rather, "inhabitress of the fortress." Though thou now seemest to inhabit an impregnable fortress, thou shalt have to remove. "The land" is the champaign region opposed to the "fortified" cities. The "fortress" being taken, the whole "land" will share the disaster. HENDERSON translates, "Gather up thy packages from the ground." ROSENMULLER, for "fortress," translates, "siege," that is, the besieged city. The various articles, in this view, are supposed to be lying about in confusion on the ground during the siege.

MICHAELIS translates, "I will bind them together (as in a sling) that they may reach the goal" (Babylon). English Version is best: "that they may find it so as I have said" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019">Num 23:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010">Eze 6:10</a>).

Accordingly, the Jews were restored after correction; the Babylonians were utterly extinguished.
