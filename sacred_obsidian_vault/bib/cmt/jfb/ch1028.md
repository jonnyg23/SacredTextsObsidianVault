 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch1 28:1</a></font></span></p>DAVID EXHORTS THE PEOPLE TO FEAR GOD. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001">Ch1 28:1-8</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>David assembled all the princes of Israel--that is, the representatives of the people, the leading men of the kingdom, who are enumerated in this verse according to their respective rank or degree of authority. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>princes of the tribes-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016">Ch1 27:16-22</a>). Those patriarchal chiefs are mentioned first as being the highest in rank--a sort of hereditary noblesse. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the captains of the companies--the twelve generals mentioned (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001">Ch1 27:1-15</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the stewards, &amp;c.-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025">Ch1 27:25-31</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the officers--Hebrew, "eunuchs," or attendants on the court (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015">Sa1 8:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#009">Kg1 22:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#018">Kg2 22:18</a>); and besides Joab, the commander-in-chief of the army, the heroes who had no particular office (1Ch. 11:10-12:40; 2Sa. 23:8-39). This assembly, a very mixed and general one, as appears from the parties invited, was more numerous and entirely different from that mentioned (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002">Ch1 23:2</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002">1 Chronicles 28:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch1 28:2</a></font></span></p>Hear me, my brethren, and my people--This was the style of address becoming a constitutional king of Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020">Deu 17:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#023">Sa1 30:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001">Sa2 5:1</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>I had in mine heart--I proposed, or designed. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to build an house of rest--a solid and permanent temple. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for the footstool of our God--God seated between the cherubim, at the two extremities of the ark, might be said to be enthroned in His glory, and the coverlet of the ark to be His footstool. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and had made ready for the building--The immense treasures which David had amassed and the elaborate preparations he had made, would have been amply sufficient for the erection of the temple of which he presented the model to Solomon.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#003">1 Chronicles 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">ch1 28:3</a></font></span></p>thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood--The church or spiritual state of the world, of which the temple at Jerusalem was to be a type, would be presided over by One who was to be pre-eminently the Prince of Peace, and therefore would be represented not so fitly by David, whose mission had been a preparatory one of battle and conquest, as by his son, who should reign in unbroken peace.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004">1 Chronicles 28:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch1 28:4</a></font></span></p>he hath chosen Solomon--The spirit of David's statement is this:--It was not my ambition, my valor, or my merit that led to the enthronement of myself and family; it was the grace of God which chose the tribe, the family, the person--myself in the first instance, and now Solomon, to whom, as the Lord's anointed, you are all bound to submit. Like that of Christ, of whom he was a type, the appointment of Solomon to the kingdom above all his brethren was frequently pre-intimated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#012">Ch1 17:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009">Ch1 22:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012">Sa2 7:12-14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024">Sa2 12:24-25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#013">Kg1 1:13</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#007">1 Chronicles 28:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ch1 28:7</a></font></span></p>I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments--The same condition is set before Solomon by God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014">Kg1 3:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004">Kg1 9:4</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008">1 Chronicles 28:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">ch1 28:8</a></font></span></p>Now . . . in the sight of all Israel, . . . keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord, &amp;c.--This solemn and earnest exhortation to those present, and to all Israel through their representatives, to continue faithful in observing the divine law as essential to their national prosperity and permanence, is similar to that of Moses (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015">Deu 30:15-20</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009">1 Chronicles 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">ch1 28:9</a></font></span></p>HE ENCOURAGES SOLOMON TO BUILD THE TEMPLE. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009">Ch1 28:9-20</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>And thou, Solomon my son--The royal speaker now turns to Solomon, and in a most impressive manner presses upon him the importance of sincere and practical piety. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>know thou--He did not mean head knowledge, for Solomon possessed that already, but that experimental acquaintance with God which is only to be obtained by loving and serving Him.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011">1 Chronicles 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">ch1 28:11</a></font></span></p>Then David gave to Solomon . . . the pattern--He now put into the hands of his son and successor the plan or model of the temple, with the elevations, measurements, apartments, and chief articles of furniture, all of which were designed according to the pattern given him by divine revelation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019">Ch1 28:19</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012">1 Chronicles 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">ch1 28:12</a></font></span></p>the pattern of all that he had by the spirit--rather, "with him in spirit"; that is, was floating in his mind.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015">1 Chronicles 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">ch1 28:15</a></font></span></p>the candlesticks of silver--Solomon made them all of gold--in this and a few minor particulars departing from the letter of his father's instructions, where he had the means of executing them in a more splendid style. There was only one candlestick and one table in the tabernacle, but ten in the temple.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018">1 Chronicles 28:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">ch1 28:18</a></font></span></p>the chariot of the cherubim--The expanded wings of the cherubim formed what was figuratively styled the throne of God, and as they were emblematical of rapid motion, the throne or seat was spoken of as a chariot (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010">Psa 18:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001">Psa 99:1</a>). It is quite clear that in all these directions David was not guided by his own taste, or by a desire for taking any existing model of architecture, but solely by a regard to the express revelation of the divine will. In a vision, or trance, the whole edifice, with its appurtenances, had been placed before his eyes so vividly and permanently, that he had been able to take a sketch of them in the models delivered to Solomon.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020">1 Chronicles 28:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">ch1 28:20</a></font></span></p>Be strong and of good courage--The address begun in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009">Ch1 28:9</a> is resumed and concluded in the same strain.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#021">1 Chronicles 28:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">ch1 28:21</a></font></span></p>behold, the courses of the priests and Levites--They were, most probably, represented in this assembly though they are not named. 
 <p>
 </p><p>also the princes and all the people--that is, as well the skilful, expert, and zealous artisan, as the workman who needs to be directed in all his labors.
