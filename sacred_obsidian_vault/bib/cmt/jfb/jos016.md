 <p>
 </p><p>the lot of the children of Joseph fell--Hebrew, "went forth," referring either to the lot as drawn out of the urn, or to the tract of land thereby assigned. The first four verses describe the territory allotted to the family of Joseph in the rich domains of central Palestine. It was drawn in one lot, that the brethren might be contiguously situated; but it was afterwards divided. The southern boundary only is described here; that on the north being irregular and less defined (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010">Jos 17:10-11</a>), is not mentioned.

 <p>
 </p><p>the border of their inheritance . . . was Ataroth-addar--Ataroth-addar (now Atara), four miles south of Jetta [ROBINSON], is fixed on as a center, through which a line is drawn from Upper Beth-horon to Michmethah, showing the western limit of their actual possessions. The tract beyond that to the sea was still unconquered.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jos 16:6</a></font></span></p>Michmethah on the north side--The northern boundary is traced from this point eastward to the Jordan.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jos 16:8</a></font></span></p>from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah--It is retraced from east to west, to describe the prospective and intended boundary, which was to reach to the sea. Kanah ("reedy") flows into the Mediterranean.
