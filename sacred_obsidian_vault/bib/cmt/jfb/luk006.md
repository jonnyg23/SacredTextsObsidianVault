 </p><p>second sabbath after the first--an obscure expression, occurring here only, generally understood to mean, the first sabbath after the second day of unleavened bread. The reasons cannot be stated here, nor is the opinion itself quite free from difficulty.

(See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028">Mar 2:28</a>.)

(See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004">Mar 3:4</a>.)

 </p><p>
 </p><p>all night in prayer . . . and when . . . day, he called, &amp;c.--The work with which the next day began shows what had been the burden of this night's devotions. As He directed His disciples to pray for "laborers" just before sending themselves forth (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037">Mat 9:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001">Mat 10:1</a>), so here we find the Lord Himself in prolonged communion with His Father in preparation for the solemn appointment of those men who were to give birth to His Church, and from whom the world in all time was to take a new mould. How instructive is this!

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">luk 6:17</a></font></span></p>in the plain--by some rendered "on a level place," that is, a piece of high tableland, by which they understand the same thing, as "on the mountain," where our Lord delivered the sermon recorded by Matthew (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001">Mat 5:1</a>), of which they take this following discourse of Luke to be but an abridged form. But as the sense given in our version is the more accurate, so there are weighty reasons for considering the discourses different. This one contains little more than a fourth of the other; it has woes of its own, as well as the beatitudes common to both; but above all, that of Matthew was plainly delivered a good while before, while this was spoken after the choice of the twelve; and as we know that our Lord delivered some of His weightiest sayings more than once, there is no difficulty in supposing this to be one of His more extended repetitions; nor could anything be more worthy of it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">luk 6:19</a></font></span></p>healed--kept healing, denoting successive acts of mercy till it went over "all" that needed. There is something unusually grand and pictorial in this touch of description.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020">Luke 6:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">luk 6:20</a></font></span></p>In the Sermon on the Mount the benediction is pronounced upon the "poor in spirit" and those who "hunger and thirst after righteousness" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003">Mat 5:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006">Mat 5:6</a>). Here it is simply on the "poor" and the "hungry now." In this form of the discourse, then, our Lord seems to have had in view "the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him," as these very beatitudes are paraphrased by James (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005">Jam 2:5</a>).

Christ thus binds up the cause of righteousness in the world with the reception of Himself.
