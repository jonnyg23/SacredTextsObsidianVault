 <p>
 </p><p>eyes to see, and see not, . . . ears to hear, and hear not--fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004">Deu 29:4</a>, here quoted by Ezekiel (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009">Isa 6:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021">Jer 5:21</a>). Ezekiel needed often to be reminded of the people's perversity, lest he should be discouraged by the little effect produced by his prophecies. Their "not seeing" is the result of perversity, not incapacity. They are wilfully blind. The persons most interested in this prophecy were those dwelling at Jerusalem; and it is among them that Ezekiel was transported in spirit, and performed in vision, not outwardly, the typical acts. At the same time, the symbolical prophecy was designed to warn the exiles at Chebar against cherishing hopes, as many did in opposition to God's revealed word, of returning to Jerusalem, as if that city was to stand; externally living afar off, their hearts dwelt in that corrupt and doomed capital.

His simple announcements having failed, he is symbolically to give them an ocular demonstration conveyed by a word-painting of actions performed in vision.

 <p>
 </p><p>at even--not contradicting the words "by day." The baggage was to be sent before by day, and Ezekiel was to follow at nightfall [GROTIUS]; or, the preparations were to be made by day, the actual departure was to be effected at night [HENDERSON]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as they that go forth into captivity--literally, "as the goings forth of the captivity," that is, of the captive band of exiles, namely, amid the silent darkness: typifying Zedekiah's flight by night on the taking of the city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004">Jer 39:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007">Jer 52:7</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">eze 12:5</a></font></span></p>Dig--as Zedekiah was to escape like one digging through a wall, furtively to effect an escape (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012">Eze 12:12</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>carry out--namely, "thy stuff" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#004">Eze 12:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>thereby--by the opening in the wall. Zedekiah escaped "by the gate betwixt the two walls" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004">Jer 39:4</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">eze 12:6</a></font></span></p>in . . . twilight--rather, "in the dark." So in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017">Gen 15:17</a>, "it" refers to "thy stuff." 
 <p>
 </p><p>cover thy face--as one who muffles his face, afraid of being recognized by anyone meeting him. So the Jews and Zedekiah should make their exit stealthily and afraid to look around, so hurried should be their fight [CALVIN]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>sign--rather, "a portent," namely, for evil.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#009">Ezekiel 12:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">eze 12:9</a></font></span></p>What doest thou?--They ask not in a docile spirit, but making a jest of his proceedings.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">eze 12:10</a></font></span></p>burden--that is, weighty oracle. 
 <p>
 </p><p>the prince--The very man Zedekiah, in whom they trust for safety, is to be the chief sufferer. JOSEPHUS [Antiquities, 10.7] reports that Ezekiel sent a copy of this prophecy to Zedekiah. As Jeremiah had sent a letter to the captives at the Chebar, which was the means of calling forth at first the agency of Ezekiel, so it was natural for Ezekiel to send a message to Jerusalem confirming the warnings of Jeremiah. The prince, however, fancying a contradiction between <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013">Eze 12:13</a>; "he shall not see Babylon," and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008">Jer 24:8-9</a>, declaring he should be carried to Babylon, believed neither. Seeming discrepancies in Scripture on deeper search prove to be hidden harmonies.

 <p>
 </p><p>shall bear--namely, his "stuff for removing"; his equipments for his journey.

He shall be inextricably entangled in it, as in the meshes of a net. It is God's net (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006">Job 19:6</a>). Babylon was God's instrument (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005">Isa 10:5</a>). Called "a net" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014">Hab 1:14-16</a>).

 </p><p>bring him to Babylon . . . ; yet shall he not see it--because he should be deprived of sight before he arrived there (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011">Jer 52:11</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eze 12:16</a></font></span></p>I will leave a few . . . that they may declare . . . abominations--God's purpose in scattering a remnant of Jews among the Gentiles; namely, not only that they themselves should be weaned from idolatry (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015">Eze 12:15</a>), but that by their own word, as also by their whole state as exiles, they should make God's righteousness manifest among the Gentiles, as vindicated in their punishment for their sins (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010">Isa 43:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013">Zac 8:13</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>land of Israel--contrasted with "the people in the land" of Chaldea. So far from being fortunate as the exiles in Chaldea regarded them, the Jews in Jerusalem are truly miserable, for the worst is before them, whereas the exiles have escaped the miseries of the coming siege. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>land . . . desolate from all that is therein--literally "that the land (namely, Judea) may be despoiled of the fulness thereof"; emptied of the inhabitants and abundance of flocks and corn with which it was filled. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>because of . . . violence-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034">Psa 107:34</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">eze 12:20</a></font></span></p>the cities--left in Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022">Ezekiel 12:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">eze 12:22</a></font></span></p>proverb--The infidel scoff, that the threatened judgment was so long in coming, it would not come at all, had by frequent repetition come to be a "proverb" with them. This skeptical habit contemporary prophets testify to (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015">Jer 17:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007">Jer 20:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012">Zep 1:12</a>). Ezekiel, at the Chebar, thus sympathizes with Jeremiah and strengthens his testimony at Jerusalem. The tendency to the same scoff showed itself in earlier times, but had not then developed into a settled "proverb" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019">Isa 5:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018">Amo 5:18</a>). It shall again be the characteristic of the last times, when "faith" shall be regarded as an antiquated thing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008">Luk 18:8</a>), seeing that it remains stationary, whereas worldly arts and sciences progress, and when the "continuance of all things from creation" will be the argument against the possibility of their being suddenly brought to a standstill by the coming of the Lord (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005">Isa 66:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003">Pe2 3:3-4</a>). The very long-suffering of God, which ought to lead men to repentance, is made an argument against His word (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011">Ecc 8:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003">Amo 6:3</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>days . . . prolonged . . . vision faileth--their twofold argument: (1) The predictions shall not come to pass till long after our time. (2) They shall fail and prove vain shadows. God answers both in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023">Eze 12:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#025">Eze 12:25</a>.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023">Ezekiel 12:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">eze 12:23</a></font></span></p>effect--literally, "the word," namely, fulfilled; that is, the effective fulfilment of whatever the prophets have spoken is at hand.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#024">Ezekiel 12:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">eze 12:24</a></font></span></p>no more . . . vain vision . . . flattering divination--All those false prophets (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014">Lam 2:14</a>), who "flattered" the people with promises of peace and safety, shall be detected and confounded by the event itself.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#025">Ezekiel 12:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">eze 12:25</a></font></span></p>word . . . shall come to pass--in opposition to their scoff "the vision faileth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022">Eze 12:22</a>). The repetition, "I will speak . . . speak," &amp;c. (or as FAIRBAIRN, "For I, Jehovah, will speak whatever word I shall speak, and it shall be done") implies that whenever God speaks, the effect must follow; for God, who speaks, is not divided in Himself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#028">Eze 12:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011">Isa 55:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012">Dan 9:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#033">Luk 21:33</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>no more prolonged--in opposition to the scoff (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022">Eze 12:22</a>), "The days are prolonged." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>in your days--while you are living (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034">Mat 24:34</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027">Ezekiel 12:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">eze 12:27</a></font></span></p>Not a mere repetition of the scoff (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022">Eze 12:22</a>); there the scoffers asserted that the evil was so often threatened and postponed, it must have no reality; here formalists do not go so far as to deny that a day of evil is coming, but assert it is still far off (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003">Amo 6:3</a>). The transition is easy from this carnal security to the gross infidelity of the former class.
