(Psa. 104:1-35)
 <p>
 </p><p>God's essential glory, and also that displayed by His mighty works, afford ground for praise.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">psa 104:6</a></font></span></p>These verses rather describe the wonders of the flood than the creation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#019">Gen 7:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005">Pe2 3:5-6</a>). God's method of arresting the flood and making its waters subside is poetically called a "rebuke" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006">Psa 76:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002">Isa 50:2</a>), and the process of the flood's subsiding by undulations among the hills and valleys is vividly described.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 104:10</a></font></span></p>Once destructive, these waters are subjected to the service of God's creatures. In rain and dew from His chambers (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003">Psa 104:3</a>), and fountains and streams, they give drink to thirsting animals and fertilize the soil. Trees thus nourished supply homes to singing birds, and the earth teems with the productions of God's wise agencies,

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">psa 104:24</a></font></span></p>From a view of the earth thus full of God's blessings, the writer passes to the sea, which, in its immensity, and as a scene and means of man's activity in commerce, and the home of countless multitudes of creatures, also displays divine power and beneficence.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">psa 104:27</a></font></span></p>The entire dependence of this immense family on God is set forth. With Him, to kill or make alive is equally easy. To hide His face is to withdraw favor (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001">Psa 13:1</a>). By His spirit, or breath, or mere word, He gives life. It is His constant providence which repairs the wastes of time and disease.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#031">Psalms 104:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">psa 104:31</a></font></span></p>While God could equally glorify His power in destruction, that He does it in preservation is of His rich goodness and mercy, so that we may well spend our lives in grateful praise, honoring to Him, and delightful to pious hearts (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001">Psa 147:1</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035">Psalms 104:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">psa 104:35</a></font></span></p>Those who refuse such a protector and withhold such a service mar the beauty of His works, and must perish from His presence. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Praise ye the Lord--The Psalm closes with an invocation of praise, the translation of a Hebrew phrase, which is used as an English word, "Hallelujah," and may have served the purpose of a chorus, as often in our psalmody, or to give fuller expression to the writer's emotions. It is peculiar to Psalms composed after the captivity, as "Selah" is to those of an earlier date.
