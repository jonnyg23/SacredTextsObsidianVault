(Zep. 3:1-20)
 <p>
 </p><p>filthy--MAURER translates from a different root, "rebellious," "contumacious." But the following term, "polluted," refers rather to her inward moral filth, in spite of her outward ceremonial purity [CALVIN]. GROTIUS says, the Hebrew is used of women who have prostituted their virtue. There is in the Hebrew Moreah; a play on the name Moriah, the hill on which the temple was built; implying the glaring contrast between their filthiness and the holiness of the worship on Moriah in which they professed to have a share. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005">Zephaniah 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">zep 3:5</a></font></span></p>The Jews regard not God's justice manifested in the midst of them, nor His judgments on the guilty nations around. 
 <p>
 </p><p>The just Lord--Why then are ye so unjust? 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>is in the midst thereof--He retorts on them their own boast, "Is not the Lord among us" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011">Mic 3:11</a>)? True He is, but it is for another end from what ye think [CALVIN]; namely, to lead you by the example of His righteousness to be righteous. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002">Lev 19:2</a>, "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy" [MAURER]. But CALVIN, "That ye may feel His hand to be the nearer for taking vengeance for your crimes: 'He will not do iniquity' by suffering your sins to go unpunished" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004">Deu 32:4</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>every morning--literally, "morning by morning." The time in the sultry East for dispensing justice. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>bring . . . to light--publicly and manifestly by the teaching of His prophets, which aggravates their guilt; also by samples of His judgments on the guilty. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he faileth not--He is continually setting before you samples of His justice, sparing no pains. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004">Isa 5:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004">Isa 50:4</a>, "he wakeneth morning by morning." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>knoweth no shame--The unjust Jews are not shamed by His justice into repentance.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006">Zephaniah 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">zep 3:6</a></font></span></p>I had hoped that My people by My judgments on other nations would be led to amendment; but they are not, so blinded by sin are they. 
 <p>
 </p><p>towers--literally, "angles" or "corners"; hence the towers built at the angles of their city walls. Under Josiah's long and peaceful reign the Jews were undisturbed, while the great incursion of Scythians into Western Asia took place. The judgment on the ten tribes in a former reign also is here alluded to.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007">Zephaniah 3:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">zep 3:7</a></font></span></p>I said, Surely, &amp;c.--God speaks after the manner of men in condescension to man's infirmity; not as though God was ignorant of the future contingency, but in their sense, Surely one might have expected ye would under such circumstances repent: but no! 
 <p>
 </p><p>thou--at least, O Jerusalem! Compare "thou, even thou, at least in this thy day" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042">Luk 19:42</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>their dwelling--the sanctuary [BUXTORF]. Or, the city. Compare Jesus' words (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035">Luk 13:35</a>), "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031">Lev 26:31-32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025">Psa 69:25</a>); and used as to the temple (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012">Mic 3:12</a>). "Their" is used instead of "thy"; this change of person implies that God puts them to a greater distance. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>howsoever I punished them--Howsoever I might have punished them, I would not have cut off their dwelling. CALVIN, "Howsoever I had marked them out for punishment" because of their provocations, still, if even then they had repented, taught by My corrections, I was ready to have pardoned them. MAURER, "Altogether in accordance with what I had long ago decreed (ordained) concerning you" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001">Deu 28:1-14</a>, and, on the other hand, Deu. 28:15-68; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015">Deu 27:15-26</a>). English Version, or CALVIN'S view, is better. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>rose early, and corrupted, &amp;c.--Early morning is in the East the best time for transacting serious business, before the relaxing heat of midday comes on. Thus it means, With the greatest earnestness they set themselves to "corrupt all their doings" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012">Gen 6:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011">Isa 5:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007">Jer 11:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003">Jer 25:3</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008">Zephaniah 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">zep 3:8</a></font></span></p>wait ye upon me--Here Jehovah turns to the pious Jews. Amidst all these judgments on the Jewish nation, look forward to the glorious time of restoration to be ushered in by God's precious outpouring of wrath on all nations, Isa. 30:18-33; where the same phrase, "blessed are all they that wait for Him," is used as to the same great event. CALVIN erroneously makes this verse an address to the ungodly; and so MAURER, "Ye shall not have to wait for Me in vain"; I will presently come armed with indignation: I will no longer contend with you by My prophets. 
 <p>
 </p><p>until the day--that is, waiting for the day (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003">Hab 2:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>rise up to the prey--like a savage beast rising from his lair, greedy for the prey (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028">Mat 24:28</a>). Or rather, as a warrior leading Israel to certain victory, which is expressed by "the prey," or booty, which is the reward of victory. The Septuagint and Syriac versions read the Hebrew, "I rise up as a witness" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008">Job 16:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005">Mal 3:5</a>). Jehovah being in this view witness, accuser, and judge. English Version is better (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023">Isa 33:23</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>gather the nations--against Jerusalem (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2</a>), to pour out His indignation upon them there (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002">Joe 3:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002">Zac 12:2-3</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009">Zephaniah 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">zep 3:9</a></font></span></p>For--The blessed things promised in this and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010">Zep 3:10</a> are the immediate results of the punishment inflicted on the nations, mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008">Zep 3:8</a> (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019">Zep 3:19</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>turn to the people a pure language--that is, changing their impure language I will give to them again a pure language (literally, "lip"). Compare for this Hebrew idiom, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009">Sa1 10:9</a>, Margin. The confusion of languages was of the penalty sin, probably idolatry at Babel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001">Gen 11:1-6</a>, Margin, where also "lip" expresses language, and perhaps also religion; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004">Zep 3:4</a>, "a tower whose top may reach unto heaven," or rather, points to heaven, namely, dedicated to the heavens idolized, or Bel); certainly, of rebellion against God's will. An earnest of the removal of this penalty was the gift of tongues on pentecost (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006">Act 2:6-13</a>). The full restoration of the earth's unity of language and of worship is yet future, and is connected with the restoration of the Jews, to be followed by the conversion of the world. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018">Isa 19:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009">Zac 14:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006">Rom 15:6</a>, "with one mind and one mouth glorify God." The Gentiles' lips have been rendered impure through being the instruments of calling on idols and dishonoring God (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004">Psa 16:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017">Hos 2:17</a>). Whether Hebrew shall be the one universal language or not, the God of the Hebrews shall be the one only object of worship. Until the Holy Ghost purify the lips, we cannot rightly call upon God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005">Isa 6:5-7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>serve him with one consent--literally, "shoulder" or "back"; metaphor from a yoke, or burden, borne between two (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023">Num 13:23</a>); helping one another with conjoint effort. If one of the two bearers of a burden, laid on both conjointly, give way, the burden must fall to the earth [CALVIN]. Christ's rule is called a burden (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030">Mat 11:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028">Act 15:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024">Rev 2:24</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014">Co2 6:14</a> for the same image).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010">Zephaniah 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">zep 3:10</a></font></span></p>From beyond . . . Ethiopia my suppliants--literally, "burners of incense" (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002">Psa 141:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008">Rev 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003">Rev 8:3-4</a>). The Israelites are meant, called "the daughter of My dispersed," a Hebrew idiom for My dispersed people. "The rivers of Ethiopia" are those which enclose it on the north. In the west of Abyssinia there has long existed a people called Falashas, or "emigrants" (akin to the synonym "Philistine"). These trace their origin to Palestine and profess the Jewish religion. In physical traits they resemble the Arabs. When Bruce was there, they had a Jewish king, Gideon, and his queen, Judith. Probably the Abyssinian Christians were originally in part converted Jews. They are here made the representatives of all Israel which is to be restored. 
 <p>
 </p><p>shall bring mine offering--that is, the offering that is My right. I prefer, with DE WETTE and Chaldee Version, making "suppliants" the objective case, not the nominative. The peoples: (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008">Zep 3:8-9</a>), brought to fear Me by My judgments, "shall bring as Mine offering My suppliants (an appropriate term for the Jews, on whom then there shall have been poured the spirit of supplications, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010">Zac 12:10</a>), the daughter of My dispersed." So <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020">Isa 66:20</a>, "they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord." Compare HORSLEY'S view of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001">Isa 18:1-2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007">Isa 18:7</a>. England in this view may be the naval power to restore Israel to Palestine (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009">Isa 60:9</a>). The Hebrew for "Ethiopia" is Cush, which may include not only Ethiopia, but also the region of the Tigris and Babylon, where Nimrod, Cush's son (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008">Gen 10:8-12</a>), founded Nineveh and acquired Babylon, and where the ten tribes are mentioned as being scattered (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001">Pe1 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013">Pe1 5:13</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11</a>). The restoration under Cyrus of the Jews transported under Pharaoh-necho to Egypt and Ethiopia, was an earnest of the future restoration under Christ.

I prefer explaining it of that calm silent joy in the possession of the object of one's love, too great for words to express: just as God after the six days of creation rested with silent satisfaction in His work, for "behold it was very good" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031">Gen 1:31</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002">Gen 2:2</a>).
