Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001">Isaiah Chapter 50</a></h3>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">isa 50:1</a></font></span></p>THE JUDGMENTS ON ISRAEL WERE PROVOKED BY THEIR CRIMES, YET THEY ARE NOT FINALLY CAST OFF BY GOD. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001">Isa 50:1-11</a>)
 <p>
 </p><p>Where . . . mothers divorcement--Zion is "the mother"; the Jews are the children; and God the Husband and Father (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005">Isa 54:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005">Isa 62:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014">Jer 3:14</a>). GESENIUS thinks that God means by the question to deny that He had given "a bill of divorcement" to her, as was often done on slight pretexts by a husband (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001">Deu 24:1</a>), or that He had "sold" His and her "children," as a poor parent sometimes did (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007">Exo 21:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001">Kg2 4:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005">Neh 5:5</a>) under pressure of his "creditors"; that it was they who sold themselves through their own sins. MAURER explains, "Show the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom . . . ; produce the creditors to whom ye have been sold; so it will be seen that it was not from any caprice of Mine, but through your own fault, your mother has been put away, and you sold" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003">Isa 52:3</a>). HORSLEY best explains (as the antithesis between "I" and "yourselves" shows, though LOWTH translates, "Ye are sold") I have never given your mother a regular bill of divorcement; I have merely "put her away" for a time, and can, therefore, by right as her husband still take her back on her submission; I have not made you, the children, over to any "creditor" to satisfy a debt; I therefore still have the right of a father over you, and can take you back on repentance, though as rebellious children you have sold yourselves to sin and its penalty (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025">Kg1 21:25</a>).

The same Divine Person had "come" by His prophets in the Old Testament (appealing to them, but in vain, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025">Jer 7:25-26</a>), who was about to come under the New Testament. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>hand shortened--the Oriental emblem of weakness, as the long stretched-out hand is of power (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001">Isa 59:1</a>). Notwithstanding your sins, I can still "redeem" you from your bondage and dispersion. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>dry up . . . sea-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021">Exo 14:21</a>). The second exodus shall exceed, while it resembles in wonders, the first (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isa 11:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015">Isa 51:15</a>).

 </p><p>

 <p>
 </p><p>learned--not in mere human learning, but in divinely taught modes of instruction and eloquence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002">Isa 49:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011">Exo 4:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028">Mat 7:28-29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054">Mat 13:54</a>). 
 </p><p>

Literally, "to succor by words," namely, in their season of need, the "weary" dispersed ones of Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065">Deu 28:65-67</a>). Also, the spiritual "weary" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">Isa 42:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wakeneth morning by morning, &amp;c.--Compare "daily rising up early" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025">Jer 7:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035">Mar 1:35</a>). The image is drawn from a master wakening his pupils early for instruction. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wakeneth . . . ear--prepares me for receiving His divine instructions. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as the learned--as one taught by Him. He "learned obedience," experimentally, "by the things which He suffered"; thus gaining that practical learning which adapted Him for "speaking a word in season" to suffering men (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008">Heb 5:8</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005">Isaiah 50:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">isa 50:5</a></font></span></p>opened . . . ear--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020">Isa 42:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008">Isa 48:8</a>); that is, hath made me obediently attentive (but MAURER, "hath informed me of my duty"), as a servant to his master (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6-8</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007">Phi 2:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013">Isa 52:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isa 53:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028">Mat 20:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027">Luk 22:27</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>not rebellious--but, on the contrary, most willing to do the Father's will in proclaiming and procuring salvation for man, at the cost of His own sufferings (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5-10</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006">Isaiah 50:6</a></p>

To "pluck the hair" is the highest insult that can be offered an Oriental (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004">Sa2 10:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030">Lam 3:30</a>). "I gave" implies the voluntary nature of His sufferings; His example corresponds to His precept (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039">Mat 5:39</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>spitting--To spit in another's presence is an insult in the East, much more on one; most of all in the face (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010">Job 30:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#030">Mat 27:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032">Luk 18:32</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>set . . . face like . . . flint--set Myself resolutely, not to be daunted from My work of love by shame or suffering (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008">Eze 3:8-9</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008">Isaiah 50:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">isa 50:8</a></font></span></p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isa 49:4</a>). The believer, by virtue of his oneness with Christ, uses the same language (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008">Psa 138:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032">Rom 8:32-34</a>). But "justify" in His case, is God's judicial acceptance and vindication of Him on the ground of His own righteousness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044">Luk 23:44-47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Rom 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">Ti1 3:16</a>, with which compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018">Pe1 3:18</a>); in their case, on the ground of His righteousness and meritorious death imputed to them (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019">Rom 5:19</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>stand together--in judgment, to try the issue. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>adversary--literally, "master of my cause," that is, who has real ground of accusation against me, so that he can demand judgment to be given in his favor (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001">Zac 3:1</a>, &amp;c. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010">Rev 12:10</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009">Isaiah 50:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">isa 50:9</a></font></span></p>(Compare "deal," or "proper," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013">Isa 52:13</a>, Margin; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010">Isa 53:10</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006">Psa 118:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>as a garment-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006">Isa 51:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008">Isa 51:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026">Psa 102:26</a>). A leading constituent of wealth in the East is change of raiment, which is always liable to the inroads of the moth; hence the frequency of the image in Scripture.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010">Isaiah 50:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">isa 50:10</a></font></span></p>Messiah exhorts the godly after His example (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004">Isa 49:4-5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004">Isa 42:4</a>) when in circumstances of trial ("darkness," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005">Isa 47:5</a>), to trust in the arm of Jehovah alone. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Who is, &amp;c.--that is, Whosoever (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003">Jdg 7:3</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>obeyeth . . . servant--namely, Messiah. The godly "honor the Son, even as they honor the Father" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023">Joh 5:23</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>darkness-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008">Mic 7:8-9</a>). God never had a son who was not sometimes in the dark. For even Christ, His only Son, cried out, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>light--rather, "splendor"; bright sunshine; for the servant of God is never wholly without "light" [VITRINGA]. A godly man's way may be dark, but his end shall be peace and light. A wicked man's way may be bright, but his end shall be utter darkness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004">Psa 112:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011">Psa 97:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024">Psa 37:24</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>let him trust in the name of the Lord--as Messiah did (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008">Isa 50:8-9</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011">Isaiah 50:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">isa 50:11</a></font></span></p>In contrast to the godly (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010">Isa 50:10</a>), the wicked, in times of darkness, instead of trusting in God, trust in themselves (kindle a light for themselves to walk by) (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009">Ecc 11:9</a>). The image is continued from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010">Isa 50:10</a>, "darkness"; human devices for salvation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021">Pro 19:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009">Pro 16:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025">Pro 16:25</a>) are like the spark that goes out in an instant in darkness (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006">Job 18:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017">Job 21:17</a>, with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028">Psa 18:28</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>sparks--not a steady light, but blazing sparks extinguished in a moment. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>walk--not a command, but implying that as surely as they would do so, they should lie down in sorrow (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025">Jer 3:25</a>). In exact proportion to mystic Babylon's previous "glorifying" of herself shall be her sorrow (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030">Mat 25:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012">Mat 8:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007">Rev 18:7</a>).
