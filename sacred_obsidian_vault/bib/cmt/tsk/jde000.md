 <p>St. Jude, says Origen, has written an Epistle in a few lines indeed, but full of vigorous expressions of heavenly grace  -  Ιουδας [Strong's G2455], μεν [Strong's G3303], εγραψεν επιστολην ολιγοστιχον μεν [Strong's G3303], πεπληρωμενην δε [Strong's G1161], ουρανιου χαριτος ερρωμενων λογων. 
 </p><p>He briefly and forcibly represents the detestable doctrines and practices of certain false teachers, generally supposed to be the impure Gnostics, Nicolaitans and followers of Simon Magus; and reproves these profligate perverters of sound principles, and patrons of lewdness, with a holy indignation and just severity; while at the same time he exhorts all sound Christians, with genuine apostolic charity, to have tender compassion on these deluded wretches, and to endeavour vigorously to reclaim them from the ways of hell, and pluck them as brands out of the fire.  There is a great similarity in sentiment and style between this Epistle and the second chapter of the second Epistle of Peter.  Both writers are nearly alike in vehemence and holy indignation against impudence and lewdness, and against those who insidiously undermine chastity, purity, and sound principles.
