 <p>The Church at Philippi in Macedonia was planted by the Apostle Paul about ad 53 (Acts 16:9-40); and it appears he visited them again, ad 60, though no particulars are recorded concerning that visit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006">Act 20:6</a>).  The Philippians were greatly attached to St. Paul, and testified their affection by sending him supplies, even when labouring for other churches (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015">Phi 4:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016">Phi 4:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009">Co2 11:9</a>); and when they heard that he was under confinement at Rome, they sent Epaphroditus, one of their pastors, to him with a present, lest he should want necessaries during his imprisonment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025">Phi 2:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010">Phi 4:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014">Phi 4:14-18</a>).  The more immediate occasion of the Epistle was the return of Epaphroditus, by whom the apostle sent it as a grateful acknowledgment of their kindness; which occurred towards the close of his first imprisonment, about the end of ad 62, or the commencement of 63.
