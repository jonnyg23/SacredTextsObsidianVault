 <p>Matthew, being one of the twelve apostles, and early called to the apostleship, and from the time of his call a constant attendant on our Saviour, was perfectly well qualified to write fully the history of his life.  He relates what he saw and heard.  "He is eminently distinguished for the distinctness and particularity with which he has related many of our Lord's discourses and moral instructions.  Of these his sermon on the mount, his charge to the apostles, his illustrations of the nature of his kingdom, and his prophecy on mount Olivet, are examples.  He has also wonderfully united simplicity and energy in relating the replies of his Master to the cavils of his adversaries."  "There is not," as Dr. A. Clarke justly remarks, "one truth or doctrine, in the whole oracles of God, which is not taught in this Evangelist.  The outlines of the whole spiritual system are here correctly laid down.  even Paul himself has added nothing. He has amplified and illustrated the truths contained in this Gospel  -  under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, neither he, nor any of the other apostles, have brought to light one truth, the prototype of which has not been found in the words and acts of our blessed Lord as related by Matthew.
