 <p>The title of this Book is derived from the Septuagint; in which  it is called ΕΞΟΔΟΣ, "Exodus;" or, as it is in the Codex  Alexandrinus, ΕΞΟΔΟΣ Αιγυπτου, "the Exodus or departure from Egypt;" but it is called in Hebrew Bibles ואלה  שׁמות, Weelleh Shemoth, "these are the names," or merely, שׁמות , Shemoth, "names," from the words with which it commences.
 </p><p>Moses was undoubtedly the author of this Book, which forms a continuation of the preceding, and was evidently written after the promulgation of the law.  it embraces the history of about 145 years.  Moses, having in the Book of Genesis described the creation of the world, the origin of nations, and the peopling of the earth, details in the Book of Exodus the commencement and nature of the Jewish Church and Polity, which has very properly been termed a Theocracy (Θεοκρατια, from Θεος [Strong's G2316], God, and κρατεω [Strong's G2902], to rule), in which Jehovah appears not merely as their Creator and God, but as their King. Hence this and the following books of Moses are not purely historical; but contain not only laws for the regulation of their moral conduct and the rites and ceremonies of their religious worship, but judicial and political laws relating to government and civil life.  The stupendous facts connected with these events, may be clearly perceived by consulting the marginal references; and many of the circumstances are confirmed by the testimony of heathen writers.  Numenius, a Pythagorean philosopher, mentioned by Eusebius, speaks of the opposition of the magicians, whom he calls Jannes and Jambres, to the miracles of Moses.  Though the names of these magicians are not preserved in the Sacred Text, yet tradition had preserved them in the Jewish records, from which St. Paul (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008">Ti2 3:8</a>) undoubtedly quotes.  Add to this that many of the notions of the heathen respecting the appearance of the Deity, and their religious institutions and laws, were borrowed from this book; and many of their fables were nothing more than distorted traditions of those events which are here plainly related by Moses.
