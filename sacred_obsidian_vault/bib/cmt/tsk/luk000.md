 <p>Luke, to whom this Gospel has been uniformly attributed from the earliest ages of the Christian church, is generally allowed to have been "the beloved physician" mentioned by Paul (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014">Col 4:14</a>); and as he was the companion of that apostle, in all his labours and sufferings, for many years (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012">Act 16:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001">Act 20:1-6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001">Act 27:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002">Act 27:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#013">Act 28:13-16</a>.  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011">Ti2 4:11</a>.  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024">Plm 1:24</a>), and wrote "the Acts of the Apostles," which conclude with a brief account of Paul's imprisonment at Rome, we may be assured that he had the Apostle's sanction to what he did; and probably this Gospel was written some time before that event, about ad 63 or 64, as is generally supposed.  He would appear, from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010">Col 4:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011">Col 4:11</a>, and his intimate acquaintance with the Greek language, as well as from his Greek name Λουκας [Strong's G3065], to have been of Gentile extraction; and according to Eusebius and others, he was a native of Antioch.  But, from the Hebraisms occurring in his writings, and especially from his accurate knowledge of the Jewish rites, ceremonies, and custom, it is highly probable that he was a Jewish proselyte, and afterwards converted to Christianity.  Though he may not have been, as some have affirmed, one of the seventy disciples, and an eye-witness of our Saviour's miracles, yet his intercourse with the apostles, and those who were eye-witnesses of the works and ear witnesses of the words of Christ, renders him an unexceptional witness, if considered merely as an historian; and the early and unanimous reception of his Gospel as divinely inspired is sufficient to satisfy every reasonable person.
