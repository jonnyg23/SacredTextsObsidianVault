Still more and more, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005">Ch2 17:5</a>, and which moved Ahab to desire friendship and affinity with him, to which Jehoshaphat agreed: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and joined affinity with Ahab; king of Israel, married his son Joram to Athaliah, a daughter of Ahab by Jezebel of Zidon; which marriage proved of bad consequence to Jehoshaphat and his family.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">ch2 18:2</a></font></span></p>And after certain years,.... Two years, according to the Syriac and Arabic versions, or in the third year after the affinity was contracted, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002">Kg1 22:2</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>he went down to Ahab to Samaria; to pay him a visit upon the alliance, civil and matrimonial, contracted between them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him; entertained him and his retinue in a very grand and liberal manner: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead; from hence, to the end of the chapter, it is the same with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#004">Kg1 22:4</a>.
