 <p>
 </p><p>This chapter relates that David offered sacrifices when the ark was brought into his city, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001">Ch1 16:1</a> who were the singers he appointed to sing before it continually, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004">Ch1 16:4</a> and the song he that day composed and delivered to them to sing, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007">Ch1 16:7</a> and that he appointed not only proper persons to minister before the ark, but also before the tabernacle at Gibeon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037">Ch1 16:37</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001">1 Chronicles 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">ch1 16:1</a></font></span></p>So they brought the ark of God,.... What is contained in these three verses is the same with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017">Sa2 6:17</a>, see the notes there. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017">Sa2 6:17</a>. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018">Sa2 6:18</a>. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019">Sa2 6:19</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004">1 Chronicles 16:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">ch1 16:4</a></font></span></p>And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord,.... By singing the praises of God: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and to record; or bring to remembrance; to commemorate in a song the great and good things God had done for Israel as a people: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel; for all his benefits, and the blessings of his goodness bestowed on them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005">1 Chronicles 16:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">ch1 16:5</a></font></span></p>Asaph the chief,.... Of those that were now appointed: otherwise, of the three principal singers, Heman was the chief, and Asaph next, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033">Ch1 6:33</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, with psalteries, and with harps; to play upon them before the ark at the same time the psalms and songs were vocally sung; the above persons are such as are named before, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018">Ch1 15:18</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; he struck and played upon them, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019">Ch1 15:19</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006">1 Chronicles 16:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">ch1 16:6</a></font></span></p>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests,.... These were appointed to blow 
 <p>
 </p><p>with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; morning and evening. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007">1 Chronicles 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">ch1 16:7</a></font></span></p>Then on that day,.... The ark was brought to Zion, and the above persons appointed to minister before it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren to be sung by them now, and on every proper occasion; and this seems to be the first that was delivered to them; afterwards there were many more, as the titles of the psalms show; the following is composed of part of two others, as they now stand in the book of Psalms. From hence, to the end of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022">Ch1 16:22</a> is the same with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001">Psa 105:1</a>, with a little variation, see the notes there; and from thence to the end of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#033">Ch1 16:33</a> is <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001">Psa 96:1</a> which see; and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034">Ch1 16:34</a> is the same with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001">Psa 106:1</a>, see the notes there. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001">Psa 106:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001">Psa 107:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001">Psa 105:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#002">Psa 105:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003">Psa 105:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004">Psa 105:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005">Psa 105:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006">Psa 105:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007">Psa 105:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008">Psa 105:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009">Psa 105:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010">Psa 105:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011">Psa 105:11</a>,on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012">Psa 105:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013">Psa 105:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014">Psa 105:14</a>,on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015">Psa 105:15</a> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#035">1 Chronicles 16:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">ch1 16:35</a></font></span></p>And say ye, save us, O God of our salvation,.... The author of temporal, spiritual, and eternal salvation; the words are a direction to the singers, and those that sung with them, to express the prayer and doxology in the next verse, which both are the same with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047">Psa 106:47</a>. See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047">Psa 106:47</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048">Psa 106:48</a>; which David directed by a spirit of prophecy, foreseeing the people of Israel would be in captivity among the Heathens; though some think these were added by Ezra; for though there was in his time a return from the captivity, yet many still remained in it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037">1 Chronicles 16:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">ch1 16:37</a></font></span></p>So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren,.... Whom he, that is, David, had appointed for the service of it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>to minister before the ark continually; in singing the praises of God: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as every day's work required; at the time of the morning and evening sacrifice, as Jarchi and Kimchi interpret it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038">1 Chronicles 16:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">ch1 16:38</a></font></span></p>The Levites, the brethren of Asaph and Obededom, these were left before the ark to minister there: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Obededom also the son of Jeduthun; or Ethan, which some take to be another Obededom; but the  "vau" may be explanative, "even Obededom": 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Hosah to be porters; these he left to be doorkeepers of the ark. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039">1 Chronicles 16:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">ch1 16:39</a></font></span></p>And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests,.... These he left, having appointed them 
 <p>
 </p><p>to be before the tabernacle of the Lord, in the high place that was at Gibeon; namely, the tabernacle of Moses, which was removed from Nob thither in the days of Saul, and continued there to the times of Solomon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#028">Ch1 21:28</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#040">1 Chronicles 16:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">ch1 16:40</a></font></span></p>To offer burnt offerings unto the Lord,.... Which was the work of the priests only to do: 
 <p>
 </p><p>upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening; the lambs of the daily sacrifice, which were a burnt offering, and only to be offered on the brasen altar at the tabernacle: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel; with regard to them, and all other sacrifices, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038">Exo 29:38</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041">1 Chronicles 16:41</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_041">ch1 16:41</a></font></span></p>And with them,.... That is, with Zadok, and the priests with him at Gibeon: 
 <p>
 </p><p>he left Heman and Jeduthun: or Ethan, two principal singers: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#018">Ch1 16:18</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to give thanks to the Lord, because his mercy endureth for ever; to praise him for his benefits, flowing from his grace and mercy continually. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042">1 Chronicles 16:42</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_042">ch1 16:42</a></font></span></p>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, with trumpets and cymbals,.... Or with them were the trumpets and cymbals, as Kimchi; or, as Piscator supplies it, with them he "left" the trumpets and cymbals: 
 <p>
 </p><p>for those that should make a sound; by striking upon them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and with musical instruments of God; sacred ones, such as were devoted to his service, as psalteries and harps; the Syriac and Arabic versions carry the sense of the words quite differently, that these men did not sing with those musical instruments, but with a pleasant voice, and with pure and acceptable prayers, in humility and uprightness, glorified God: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the sons of Jeduthun were porters; at the tabernacle in Gibeon. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#043">1 Chronicles 16:43</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_043">ch1 16:43</a></font></span></p>And all the people departed, every man to his house,.... Having accompanied the ark to its place, and having praised the Lord for it, and been refreshed with food, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019">Sa2 6:19</a>. 
 <p>
 </p><p>and David returned to bless his house; his family; the Targum is,"to bless the people;''see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020">Sa2 6:20</a>.
