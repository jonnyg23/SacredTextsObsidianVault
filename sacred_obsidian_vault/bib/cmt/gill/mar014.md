 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001">Mark 14:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mar 14:1</a></font></span></p>After two days was the feast of the passover,.... That is, two days after Christ had delivered the foregoing discourse concerning the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem, was the feast of the passover; which was kept in commemoration of God's passing over the houses of the Israelites, when he destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, and made way for the deliverance of the children of Israel from thence: and which was kept by eating the passover lamb; and which, properly speaking, is the feast of the passover: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and of unleavened bread; which was the same feast with the other, called so from the unleavened bread which was then eaten; though with this difference, the passover lamb was only eaten on the first night, but unleavened bread was eaten for seven days together. The Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions render it, "the passover of unleavened bread", leaving out the copulative "and". 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And the chief priests and Scribes sought how they might take him by craft; that is, Jesus, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and put him to death: for which purpose they assembled together in Caiaphas the high priest's palace, and there took counsel together how to accomplish it; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002">Mat 26:2</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#002">Mark 14:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mar 14:2</a></font></span></p>But they said not on the feast day,.... The feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread, which was nigh at hand, and would be two days hence, when there would be a great concourse of people from all parts to keep it: and therefore they did not choose to seize him, and put him to death at that time, 
 <p>
 </p><p>lest there should be an uproar of the people; or among them, lest they should rise in his favour, and rescue him out of their hands; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#005">Mat 26:5</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003">Mark 14:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mar 14:3</a></font></span></p>And being in Bethany,.... A place about two miles from Jerusalem, whither he retired after he had took his leave of the temple, and had predicted its destruction; a place he often went to, and from, the last week of his life; having some dear friends, and familiar acquaintance there, as Lazarus, and his two sisters, Martha and Mary, and the person next mentioned: 
 <p>
 </p><p>in the house of Simon the leper; so called because he had been one, and to distinguish him from Simon the Pharisee, and Simon Peter the apostle, and others; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006">Mat 26:6</a>; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as he sat at meat there came a woman; generally thought to be Mary Magdalene, or Mary the sister of Lazarus: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard; or "pure nard", unmixed and genuine; or liquid nard, which was drinkable, and so easy to be poured out; or Pistic nard, called so, either from "Pista", the name of a place from whence it was brought, or from "Pistaca", which, with the Rabbins, signifies "maste"; of which, among other things, this ointment was made. Moreover, ointment of nard was made both of the leaves of nard, and called foliate nard, and of the spikes of it, and called, as here, spikenard. Now ointment made of nard was, as Pliny says (w), the principal among ointments. The Syriac is, by him, said to be the best; this here is said to be 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>very precious, costly, and valuable: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and she brake the box. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, "she opened it"; and the Persic version, "she opened the head", or "top of the bottle", or "vial": 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and poured it on his head; on the head of Christ, as the same version presses it; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007">Mat 26:7</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(w) Nat. Hist. l. 12. c. 12. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#004">Mark 14:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mar 14:4</a></font></span></p>And there were some that had indignation within themselves,.... The Syriac version reads, "some of the disciples": agreeably to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008">Mat 26:8</a>, particularly Judas, and others might be incensed by his means: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and said, why was this waste of the ointment made? See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008">Mat 26:8</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005">Mark 14:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mar 14:5</a></font></span></p>For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,.... Which, was to the value of our money nine pounds, seven shillings, and sixpence: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and given to the poor; which was thought to be a better way of expending it, than by pouring it on the head of Christ: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and they murmured against her: that she should lavish so much money away in such an imprudent manner; they reproved her for it, expressed much resentment at it, and were very angry with, her upon the account of it; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008">Mat 26:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#009">Mat 26:9</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#006">Mark 14:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mar 14:6</a></font></span></p>And Jesus said, let her alone,.... Jesus knowing the secret indignation of some of his disciples, and their private murmurings at the woman, and their continual teasings of her, because of the expense of the ointment, said to them, as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions read; or "to the disciples", as the Persic, let the woman alone, cease to chide and reprove her for what she has done; 
 <p>
 </p><p>why trouble ye her? why do you grieve her, by charging her with imprudence and extravagance, as if she had been guilty of a very great crime? she is so far from it, that 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>she hath wrought a good work on me; she has done me an honour; expressed faith in me, and shown love to me, and ought to be commended, and not reproved; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010">Mat 26:10</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#007">Mark 14:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mar 14:7</a></font></span></p>For ye have the poor with you always,.... See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011">Mat 26:11</a>; 
 <p>
 </p><p>and whensoever ye will ye may do them good; by feeding them when hungry, clothing them when naked, and supplying them with the necessaries of life: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but me ye have not always; meaning, with respect to his bodily presence, which, in a short time, would be removed from them, and they would have no opportunity of showing him any such outward respect personally; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011">Mat 26:11</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008">Mark 14:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mar 14:8</a></font></span></p>She hath done what she could,.... What she had in her heart, and in the power of her hands to do; she hath done according to her ability, and her good will; and if she had not done it now, she could not have done it at all. 
 <p>
 </p><p>She is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying; or, "as if it was to bury me", as the Syriac version renders it. Christ signifies by this, that he should shortly die, and that this woman came before hand to anoint him, and, as it were, to perform the funeral rites before he was dead; it being revealed to her by the Spirit, that Jesus would quickly die, and she should not be able to perform this good work when dead, and therefore came to do it before; or, at least, she was directed by the Spirit of God, because she would be prevented doing it afterwards; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#012">Mat 26:12</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#009">Mark 14:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mar 14:9</a></font></span></p>Verily I say unto you,.... And you may assure yourselves of the truth of it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>wheresoever this Gospel, of the death and resurrection of Christ, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>shall be preached throughout the whole world, as it shall be, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her; in remembrance of her, and her work, and in commendation of her faith, love, and duty; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013">Mat 26:13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010">Mark 14:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mar 14:10</a></font></span></p>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve,.... Apostles of Christ; who was the principal person that had indignation at the woman, and murmured against her, for the profusion of the ointment: 
 <p>
 </p><p>went unto the chief priests; as soon as this affair was over, and Christ had defended the woman's conduct to his shame and silence: he immediately went out of the house, where they were, and set out from Bethany to Jerusalem; and understanding the chief priests were in consultation together at Caiaphas's house, how to apprehend Jesus, and put him to death, went directly to them, unsent for, and unthought of by them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>to betray him unto them; which Satan had put into his heart, and what his avarice and revenge for the late action of the woman, and Christ's defence of it, prompted him to; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014">Mat 26:14</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#011">Mark 14:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mar 14:11</a></font></span></p>And when they heard it, they were glad,.... That such an opportunity offered, and from such a quarter, by one of his own disciples; so that it might be done more secretly and effectually, and with less blame to themselves: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and promised to give him money; any sum he should ask; and what was agreed upon were thirty pieces, or shekels of silver; and so the Ethiopic version here, instead of money, reads, "thirty pieces of silver"; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015">Mat 26:15</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And he sought how he might conveniently betray him; after this promise, and upon this agreement: henceforward he sought the most fitting opportunity, and the best season of betraying his master into the hands of these men, when he was alone, and the multitude absent, and there was no danger of a tumult, or a rescue; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#016">Mat 26:16</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012">Mark 14:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mar 14:12</a></font></span></p>And the first day of unleavened bread,.... Being come, which was the fourteenth of Nisan: 
 <p>
 </p><p>when they killed the passover; that is, "the Jews", as the Syriac and Persic versions supply; for any Israelite, that not a priest, might slay it: their canon runs thus (x), 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"an Israelite kills (the passover), and a priest receives (the blood), and gives it to his neighbour, and his neighbour to his neighbour, and he receives (the basin) full, and returns it empty; the priest that is near to the altar sprinkles it, at one sprinkling, over against the bottom of it.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Upon which the commentators (y) observe, that the slaying of the passover by strangers; that is, such as are not priests, lawful. And so Philo the Jew, speaking of the passover, says (z); 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"at which time the common people do not bring their sacrifices to the altar, and the priests slay; but by the command of the law,  , "the whole nation", does the work of a priest; every one particularly bringing the sacrifices for himself, and then slaying them with his own hands.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>But then it was always killed in the court of the temple, and after the middle of the day; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017">Mat 26:17</a>; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>his disciples said unto him, where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayst eat the passover: for it was now Thursday morning, and the passover was to be slain after the middle of the day, between the two evenings, and eaten in Jerusalem at night; and they were now at Bethany, near two miles from the city; and it was usual for servants to get ready the passover for their masters; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017">Mat 26:17</a>. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013">Mark 14:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mar 14:13</a></font></span></p>And he sendeth forth two of his disciples,.... Peter and John, as appears from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#008">Luk 22:8</a>; 
 <p>
 </p><p>and saith unto them, go ye into the city; the city of Jerusalem; for there only the passover might be eaten, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002">Deu 26:2</a>; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; a servant of the master of the house that was sent for water, to mix with the wine, at the passover: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>follow him; into the house to which he goes. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014">Mark 14:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mar 14:14</a></font></span></p>And wheresoever he shall go in,.... Into whatsoever house he shall enter, go in after him: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and say ye to the good man of the house; the owner, and master of it, who might be Nicodemus, or Joseph of Arimathea, or some man of note and wealth in Jerusalem, that might have some knowledge of Christ, and faith in him, though he did not openly profess him; since by only saying what follows, he would at once, as he did, direct them to a suitable and convenient room; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the master saith. The Syriac and Persic versions read, our master saith: he that is yours, and ours, our master Jesus; though that is not expressed, yet it was understood by the master of the family; which confirms the above conjecture, that he was a secret disciple of Christ. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Where is the guest chamber; the chamber provided for guests that might be expected at the passover: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? where it might be done conveniently, and in a proper and comfortable manner; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018">Mat 26:18</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015">Mark 14:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">mar 14:15</a></font></span></p>And he will show you a large upper room,.... A room in the highest part of the house, large enough for such a company, for thirteen persons, which was the number of Christ and his disciples: 
 <p>
 </p><p>furnished and prepared; with a table, and a sufficient number of couches to sit, or lie upon, and with all proper vessels necessary on such an occasion: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>there make ready for us; the passover. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#016">Mark 14:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">mar 14:16</a></font></span></p>And his disciples went forth,.... The two disciples, as the Arabic version has it, Peter and John, set out from Bethany to Jerusalem directly: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and came into the city; the city of Jerusalem: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and found as he had said unto them; a man bearing a pitcher of water, whom they followed to the house he went into, and addressed the master of the house, as Jesus had bid them; when he showed them an upper room, very commodious and fit for the purpose, as Christ had said; and which is a considerable proof of the prescience of Christ: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and they made ready the passover; they bought a lamb; they had it killed in the temple, according to rule; and they brought it to the house, where they were to sup, and got it roasted; and provided unleavened bread, and wine, and bitter herbs, and every thing that was proper for the feast; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#019">Mat 26:19</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017">Mark 14:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">mar 14:17</a></font></span></p>And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. In the afternoon, as it is very reasonable to suppose, Christ set out from Bethany with the rest of the twelve, with the other nine, and came to Jerusalem; where they were joined by Judas, who had covenanted with the chief priests to betray him, and by Peter and John, who had been sent before to prepare the passover; and when it was night, when the second evening had took place, he went with all twelve of them to the house, where the provision to eat the passover together was made for them; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020">Mat 26:20</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#018">Mark 14:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">mar 14:18</a></font></span></p>And as they sat and did eat,.... Or "as they lay along"; for such was their posture at the eating of the passover; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020">Mat 26:20</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>Jesus said, verily I say unto you, one of you which eateth with me shall betray me; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#021">Mat 26:21</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#019">Mark 14:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mar 14:19</a></font></span></p>And they began to be sorrowful,.... And were so, all but Judas, at this saying of Christ's: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and to say unto him, one by one; even till it came to Judas himself, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>is it I? that shall betray thee; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and another said, is it I? This clause is wanting in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and in two of Beza's copies; and indeed seems to be redundant, since the disciples are said before to express themselves in this manner, one by one; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#022">Mat 26:22</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#020">Mark 14:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mar 14:20</a></font></span></p>And he answered and said unto them,.... In order to relieve their minds, and point out the particular person: 
 <p>
 </p><p>it is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish; just at that very instant; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023">Mat 26:23</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mar 14:21</a></font></span></p>The son of man indeed goeth,.... Out of this world by death, 
 <p>
 </p><p>as it is written; both in the book of God's decrees, and in the Scriptures of the Old Testament; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! whose sin will not be excused, nor lessened by fulfilling the decrees of God, and by accomplishing the prophecies of the Bible: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>good were it for that man if he had never been born; so aggravating will be his crime, so dreadful his punishment; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024">Mat 26:24</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mar 14:22</a></font></span></p>And as they did eat,.... The paschal lamb, and the unleavened bread, just at the conclusion of that feast: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; beginning and instituting a new feast, to be kept in aftertimes, in commemoration of his sufferings and death, now near at hand; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and gave to them, the disciples, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and said, take, eat: the word eat is not in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and is wanting in some copies: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>this is body; a figure and representation of it; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026">Mat 26:26</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">mar 14:23</a></font></span></p>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks,.... Over it, and for it, by blessing it, and appropriating it to the present use and service: 
 <p>
 </p><p>he gave it to them; his disciples, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and they all drank of it; Judas, as well as the rest, as he bid them do; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027">Mat 26:27</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mar 14:24</a></font></span></p>And he said unto them,.... Not after they had drank of it, but before, and as he gave it to them: 
 <p>
 </p><p>this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many; in Matthew it is added, "for the remission of sins"; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028">Mat 26:28</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mar 14:25</a></font></span></p>Verily I say unto you,.... This seems, to have been said after the eating of the passover, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#018">Luk 22:18</a>, but was, in reality, not till after the Lord's supper was ended, and the last cup was drank, which was wont to be drank at the passover: 
 <p>
 </p><p>I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine; that is, wine, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>until that day that I drink it new; in a figurative and mystical sense; by which are meant the joys of heaven: 
 </p><p>

Some think this was John, the beloved disciple, and the youngest of the disciples; others, that it was James, the brother of our Lord; but he does not seem to be any of the disciples of Christ, since he is manifestly distinguished from them, who all forsook him and fled: some have thought, that he was a young man of the house, where Christ and his disciples ate their passover; who had followed him to the garden, and still followed him, to see what would be the issue of things: but it seems most likely, that he was one that lived in an house in Gethsemane, or in or near the garden; who being awaked out of sleep with the noise of a band of soldiers, and others with them, leaped out of bed, and ran out in his shirt, and followed after them, to know what was the matter: 
 <p>
 </p><p>having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; which was either his shirt in which he lay, or one of the sheets, which he took and wrapped himself in, not staying to put on his clothes: though the word "Sindon", is used both by the Targumists (d) and Talmudists (e) for a linen garment; and sometimes even for the outer garment, to which the fringes were fastened (f); and he might take up this in haste, and slip it on, without putting on any inner garment: the word "body", is not in the text, and the phrase , may be rendered, "upon his nakedness"; and answers to  in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#023">Gen 9:23</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011">Lev 20:11</a>, and the meaning be, he had only a piece of linen wrapped about his middle, to cover his nakedness; and in this garb ran out, to see what was doing: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the young men laid hold on him. The Roman soldiers, who were commonly so called: so David's soldiers are called "young men", that were with him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004">Sa1 21:4</a>; these attempted to lay hold on this young man, taking him to be a disciple of Christ, or one at least affected to him, and did take hold of his linen cloth. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, leave out the words, "the young men". The design of Mark in relating this incident, is to show the rage and fury of these men; who were for sparing none that appeared to be or were thought to be the followers of Christ; so that the preservation of the disciples was entirely owing to the wonderful power of Christ.

 </p><p>and fled from them naked; to the house from whence he came. The Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the words "from them".

Caiaphas, as is added in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions. This was done, after they had took Jesus and bound, him, and after they had had him to Annas, who sent him bound to Caiaphas; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012">Joh 18:12</a>; 
 <p>
 </p><p>and with him, the high priest Caiaphas, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the Scribes; even the whole sanhedrim, who met at Caiaphas's house, and were waiting there for Jesus; whom Judas with his band of soldiers and others, were gone to secure, and brng before them; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057">Mat 26:57</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_054">mar 14:54</a></font></span></p>And Peter followed him afar off,.... And did another disciple, perhaps John; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015">Joh 18:15</a>, who having somewhat recovered themselves from their fright, turned back, and followed Jesus, and the company that led him away; keeping at some distance, that they might not be observed, and exposed to danger; and proceeded till they came to Jerusalem, and to the place where the sanhedrim were convened; and the other disciple went in along with Jesus; and Peter afterwards, by his means, got in: 
 <p>
 </p><p>even into the palace of the high priest; being let in by her that kept the door, at the motion of the other disciple 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and he sat with the servants; as if he was one of them, and had no concern with Jesus: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and warmed himself at the fire; or "light", as the Greek word signifies, and answers to the Hebrew word  by which both: light and fire are expressed; of which, take an instance or two, in the room of many (g): 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"a murderer that strikes, his neighbour with a stone, or with iron, and plunges him into water, or into  "fire", so that he cannot get out, and dies, is guilty.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Again (h), a 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"book which  "fire", takes hold upon on one side, he puts, water on the other; and if it is quenched, it is quenched; if the "fire" takes hold on both sides, he opens it, and reads in it; and if it is quenched, it is quenched: a cloak which "fire" takes hold upon on one side, he puts water on the other side; and if it is quenched, it is quenched; if the "fire" takes hold on it on both sides, he takes, it and wraps himself in it, and if it is quenched, it is quenched.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>So we read (i) of  , "the fire of hell"; and Ur of the Chaldees has its name from the fire, that was worshipped there, as a symbol of the sun: and fire was the  or "light", created on the first day, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003">Gen 1:3</a>; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#058">Mat 26:58</a>.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>"in pecuniary causes, they begin either for absolution, or condemnation; but in capital causes, they begin for absolution, and do not begin for condemnation.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>That is, they begun with such evidences as tended to acquit a man, and not with such as served to condemn him; whereas this court was only seeking for such evidence to begin with, that they might condemn Jesus to death:

The word "false", is not expressed in the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions: which only signify, that they bore witness against him, accused him of, and laid many things to his charge: 
 <p>
 </p><p>but their witness agreed not together; which showed it to be false, and so not to be admitted; for witnesses were to be as one in their testimony, or not to be received: the, rules concerning them with the Jews, are these (l); 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"the tradition is, for ever let not their testimony be joined together, unless they both see,  "as one": says R. Joshua ben Korcha, even one after another; and their testimony is not ratified in the council, until they both witness "as one".'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Though this is not much the sense of the passage here; it was not the falsehood of their testimony, which this council was unconcerned about, or the contradiction that was in it, which does not appear; but their testimonies were not,  "equal", or answerable to the wishes of the council; they were not sufficient to prove a capital crime upon him, in order to, put him to death, which was what they wanted: they only respected some light and trivial matters, and did not amount to a charge of blasphemy, or sedition.

 <p>
 </p><p>I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands; which was a very false testimony; for Christ did not say be would destroy any temple at all, only put the Jews on doing it; much less did he point at, or design the temple of Jerusalem, but his own body; nor did he use the distinction of a temple, made with and without hands; nor did he affirm that he would build another; only said, he would raise up in three days, that which they should destroy. By this testimony these witnesses would suggest, that Christ had a design upon their temple to demolish it, and that he must be a sorcerer, or a magician, to pretend to build a temple without hands in three days time; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#061">Mat 26:61</a>.

 <p>

The Vulgate Latin adds, "God": in Matthew it is "God" only, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063">Mat 26:63</a>. This is one of the names and epithets of God, with the Jews; nothing is more common in their writings, than this abbreviature,  which is,  , "the holy blessed he"; who is blessed in himself, and the fountain of all blessedness to his creatures, and who is blessed and praised by angels and saints; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063">Mat 26:63</a>.

 </p><p>and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. The Syriac version renders it, "on his cheeks": they gave him slaps on the face. These were the officers of the high priest, that used him in this indecent manner. This clause is omitted in the Ethiopic version.

 <p>
 </p><p>and began to say to them that stood by; the fire, along with Peter, warming themselves:

 </p><p>this is one of them; this man is one of the disciples and followers of Jesus of Nazareth; he is of that sect, he certainly belongs to them, and is come here only as a spy.

 </p><p>
 </p><p>they that stood by, said again to Peter, surely thou art one of them; one confidently affirmed that he was with Jesus, and another challenged him with seeing him in the garden with him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059">Luk 22:59</a>, and in general they were of opinion, that he must be one of that sect, giving this as a reason, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for thou art a Galilean: as they supposed Jesus to be; and knowing that in Galilee he had chiefly preached, and wrought his miracles, and had there a large number of followers: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and thy speech agreeth thereto; he used words and phrases peculiar to the Galileans, and pronounced as they did: See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073">Mat 26:73</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_072">mar 14:72</a></font></span></p>And the second time the cock crew,.... Immediately, as soon as he had so said and swore, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, and as it is read in one of Beza's copies; which was about three of the clock in the morning, and is what is properly called the cock crowing: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and Peter called to mind; upon hearing the cock crow a second time, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the word that Jesus said unto him, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice: as he now had done twice, to the maid or maids, and a third time to the servants that stood by the fire along with him: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and when he thought thereon; on the words of Christ, and on his sin in denying him, and on the aggravated circumstances of it. The Arabic version renders it, "he turned himself to weep"; he turned away from the company, he threw himself out of it, and got out of doors as fast as he could, and broke out into a violent fit of weeping. The Syriac, Persic, and Vulgate Latin versions, render it, "he began to weep"; this phrase is omitted in the Ethiopic version: some choose to render it, "he looked upon him", that is, on Christ: as Christ looked upon him; which produced true evangelical repentance in him, so Peter looked upon his dear Lord with concern, whom he so had shamefully denied; he looked upon him and mourned, he looked upon him with an eye of faith, and sorrowed for his sin after a godly sort: but the true sense of the word is, "he covered himself"; he cast his garment over his head, he veiled himself as mourners did, who covered their heads, and their faces, and even their lips. So Maimonides (o); 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"from whence, says he, is uncovering the head, forbidden a mourner? For, lo! it is said to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017">Eze 24:17</a>, "cover not thy lips" at all, for the rest of mourners are obliged to the covering of the head; the linen cloth, or veil, with which he covers his head, he covers with a part of it, a little over his mouth; as it is said, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045">Lev 13:45</a>, "He shall put a covering upon his upper lip": and Onkelos paraphrases it, , "as a mourner he shall cover himself".'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And so it is said of Haman (p), 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"that he went to his house, and mourned for his daughter,   , "and put a covering on his head as a mourner": for his daughter, and for his reproach.'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And this, it seems, was the custom of the Ishmaelites: hence that saying (q), 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>"all veiling (in mourning) which is not as the veiling of the Ishmaelites (who cover all the face), is no veiling?'' 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And thus Peter, through shame, and as a token of sorrow and mourning for his sin, threw his garment over him: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and he wept; as Matthew says, "bitterly": being fully convinced of his sin, and heartily sorry lot it; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075">Mat 26:75</a>.
