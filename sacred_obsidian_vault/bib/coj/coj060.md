 <p>LVI. (1) When the ten plagues with which the Egyptians were smitten commenced, Ṣiqrops fled from Egypt to the city of Aqtēs, in Greece, which he built as the Metropolis. There he established the throne of the kingdom of the So‘anites, and became the first king of the Atinisim (Athenians)—<i>i.e.</i>, the Ṣo‘anites. After him there reigned seventeen kings and nineteen princes, until the reign of Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, King of Persia.

(5) At that time, in the days of Othniel, Cadmus reigned in Thebes, and the city of Biṭanya (###) was built by Taḥpanḥes. He first introduced the letters of the Greek writing. The city of Epira (###), now called Corinthus, was also then built by Sisipo. Minos, the son of Eoripi (###), reigned then in Crete</p>
