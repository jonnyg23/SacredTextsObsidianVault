 <p><small>1<i> Acknowledges the coming of their bishop. </i>5<i> Commends them for their subjection to their bishop, priests, and deacons; and exhorts them to continue in it: </i>15<i> is afraid even of his over-great desire to suffer, lest it should be prejudicial to him</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>IGNATIUS, who is also called Theophorus, to the holy church which is at Tralles in Asia: beloved of God the Father of Jesus Christ, elect and worthy of God, having peace  <a name="fr_904"></a><a href="#fn_904"><font size="1">12</font></a> through the flesh and blood, and passion of Jesus Christ our hope, in the resurrection which is  <a name="fr_905"></a><a href="#fn_905"><font size="1">13</font></a> by him: which also I salute in its fulness, continuing in the apostolical character, wishing all joy and happiness unto it.</p>  
 <p>2 I have  <a name="fr_906"></a><a href="#fn_906"><font size="1">14</font></a> heard of your blameless and  <a name="fr_907"></a><a href="#fn_907"><font size="1">15</font></a> constant disposition through patience, which  <a name="fr_908"></a><a href="#fn_908"><font size="1">16</font></a> not only appears in your outward</p>

 <p>conversation, but is naturally rooted and grounded in you.</p>  
 <p>3 In like manner as Polybius your bishop has declared unto me, who came to me to Smyrna, by the will of God and Jesus Christ, and so rejoiced together with me  <a name="fr_909"></a><a href="#fn_909"><font size="1">1</font></a> in my bonds for Jesus Christ, that in effect I saw your whole  <a name="fr_910"></a><a href="#fn_910"><font size="1">2</font></a> church in him.</p>  
 <p>4 Having therefore received  <a name="fr_911"></a><a href="#fn_911"><font size="1">3</font></a> testimony of your good will towards me  <a name="fr_912"></a><a href="#fn_912"><font size="1">4</font></a> for God's sake, by him;  <a name="fr_913"></a><a href="#fn_913"><font size="1">5</font></a> I seemed to find you, as also I knew that ye were the  <a name="fr_914"></a><a href="#fn_914"><font size="1">6</font></a> followers of God.</p>  
 <p>5 For  <a name="fr_915"></a><a href="#fn_915"><font size="1">7</font></a> whereas ye are subject to your bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ; who died for us, that so believing in his death, ye might  <a name="fr_916"></a><a href="#fn_916"><font size="1">8</font></a> escape death.</p>  
 <p>6 It is therefore necessary, that as ye do, so without your bishop, you should do nothing: also be ye subject to your presbyters, as to the Apostles of Jesus Christ our hope; in whom if we walk, we shall be found in him.</p>  
 <p>7  <a name="fr_917"></a><a href="#fn_917"><font size="1">9</font></a> The deacons also, as being the ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, must by all means please ye. For they are not the  <a name="fr_918"></a><a href="#fn_918"><font size="1">10</font></a> ministers of meat and drink, but of the church of God. Wherefore they must avoid all offences, as they would do fire.</p>  
 <p>8 In like manner let us reverence the deacons  <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">11</font></a> as Jesus Christ; and the bishop as the father; and the presbyters as the Sanhedrim of God, and college of the Apostles.</p>  
 <p>9 Without these there is no  <a name="fr_920"></a><a href="#fn_920"><font size="1">12</font></a> church. Concerning all which I am persuaded that ye  <a name="fr_921"></a><a href="#fn_921"><font size="1">13</font></a> think after the very same manner: for I have received, and even now have with me, the pattern of your love, in your bishop.</p>  
 <p>10 Whose very  <a name="fr_922"></a><a href="#fn_922"><font size="1">14</font></a> look is instructive; and whose mildness  <a name="fr_923"></a><a href="#fn_923"><font size="1">15</font></a> powerful:  <a name="fr_924"></a><a href="#fn_924"><font size="1">16</font></a> whom I am persuaded, the very Atheists themselves cannot but reverence.</p>  
 <p>11 But because I have a love towards you, I will not write any more sharply unto you about this matter, though I very well might; but now I have done so; lest being a condemned man, I should seem to prescribe to you as an Apostle.</p>  
 <p>12 I have  <a name="fr_925"></a><a href="#fn_925"><font size="1">17</font></a> great knowledge in God; but I  <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">18</font></a> refrain myself, lest I should perish in my boasting.</p>  
 <p>13 For now I ought the more to fear; and not to hearken to those that would puff me up.</p>  
 <p>14 For they that speak to me, in my praise, chasten me.</p>  
 <p>15 For I indeed  <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">19</font></a> desire to suffer, but I cannot tell whether I am worthy so to do.</p>  
 <p>16  <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">20</font></a> And this desire, though to others it does not appear, yet to myself it is for that very reason the more violent. I have, therefore, need of  <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">21</font></a> moderation; by which the prince of this world is destroyed.</p>  
 <p>17 Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things?—But I</p>

 <p>fear lest I should harm you, who are yet but babes in Christ: (excuse me this care;) and lest per chance being not able to receive them, ye should be choken with them.</p>  
 <p>13 For even I myself, although I am in bonds,  <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">1</font></a> yet am not therefore able to understand heavenly things:</p>  
 <p>19 As the places of the angels, and the several companies of them, under their respective princes; things visible and invisible; but in these I am yet a learner.</p>  
 <p>20 For many things are wanting to us, that we come not short of God.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. II.</h4>  
 <p><small>1<i> Warns them against heretics, </i>4<i> exhorts them to humility and unity, </i>10<i> briefly sets before them the true doctrine concerning Christ</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>I EXHORT you therefore, or rather not I, but the love of Jesus Christ; that ye use none but Christian nourishment; abstaining from pasture which is of another kind, I mean heresy.</p>  
 <p>2  <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">2</font></a> For they that are heretics, confound together the doctrine of Jesus Christ, with their own poison:  <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">3</font></a> whilst they seem worthy of belief:</p>  
 <p>3 As men give a deadly potion mixed with sweet wine; which he who drinks of, does with the treacherous pleasure sweetly drink in his own death.</p>  
 <p>4 Wherefore guard yourselves against such persons. And that you will do if you are not puffed up; but continue inseparable from Jesus Christ our God, and from your bishop, and from the commands of the Apostles.</p>  
 <p>5  <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">4</font></a> He that is within the altar is pure; but he that is without, that is, that does anything without the bishop, the presbyters, and deacons, is not pure in his conscience.</p>  
 <p>6 Not that I know there is any thing of this nature among you; but I fore-arm you, as being greatly beloved by me, foreseeing the snares of the devil.</p>  
 <p>7 Wherefore putting on meekness, renew yourselves in faith, that is, the flesh of the Lord; and in charity, that is, the blood of Jesus Christ.</p>  
 <p>8 Let no man have any  <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">5</font></a> grudge against his neighbour. Give no occasion to the Gentiles; lest by means of a few foolish men, the whole congregation of God be evil spoken of.</p>  
 <p>9 For woe to that man  <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">6</font></a> through whose vanity my name is blasphemed by any.</p>  
 <p>10 Stop your ears therefore, as often as any one shall  <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">7</font></a> speak contrary to Jesus Christ; who was of the race of David, of the Virgin Mary.</p>  
 <p>11 Who was truly born and did eat and drink; was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; was truly crucified and dead; both those in heaven and on earth,  <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">8</font></a> being spectators of it.</p>  
 <p>12 Who was also truly raised from the dead  <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">9</font></a> by his Father. after the same manner as  <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">10</font></a> he will also raise up us who believe in him by Christ Jesus; without whom we have no true life.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Atheists, that is to say infidels, pretend, that he only seemed to suffer: (they themselves only seeming to exist) why then am I bound?—Why do I desire to fight with beasts?—Therefore do I die in vain: therefore I will not speak falsely against the Lord.</p>  
 <p>14 Flee therefore these evil  <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_940"><font size="1">1</font></a> sprouts which bring forth deadly fruit; of which if any one taste, he shall presently die.</p>  
 <p>15 For these are not the plants of the Father; seeing if they were, they would appear to be the branches of the cross, and their fruit would be incorruptible; by which he invites you through his passion, who are members of him.</p>  
 <p>16 For the head cannot be without its members, God having promised a union, that is himself.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. III.</h4>  
 <p><small><i>He again exhorts to unity: and desires their prayers for himself and for his church at Antioch</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>I SALUTE you from Smyrna,  <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_941"><font size="1">2</font></a> together with the churches of God that are present with me; who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit.</p>  
 <p>2 My bonds, which I carry about me for the sake of Christ, beseeching him that I may attain unto God) exhort you, that you continue in  <a name="fr_942"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_942"><font size="1">3</font></a> concord among yourselves and in prayer with one another.</p>  
 <p>3 For it becomes every one of you, especially the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the Father of Jesus Christ and of the Apostles.</p>  
 <p>4 I beseech you, that you hearken to me in love; that I may not  <a name="fr_943"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_943"><font size="1">4</font></a> by those things which I write, rise up in witness against you.</p>  
 <p>5 Pray also for me; who through the mercy of God stand in need of your prayers, that I may be worthy of the portion which I am about to obtain that I be not found a reprobate.</p>  
 <p>6 The love of those who are at Smyrna and Ephesus salute you. Remember in your prayers the church of Syria, from which I am not worthy to be called, being one of the least  <a name="fr_944"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_944"><font size="1">5</font></a> of it.</p>  
 <p>7 Fare ye well in Jesus Christ; being subject to your bishop as to the command of God; and so likewise to the presbytery.</p>  
 <p>8 Love every one his brother with an  <a name="fr_945"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_945"><font size="1">6</font></a> unfeigned heart.  <a name="fr_946"></a><a href="lbob21.htm#fn_946"><font size="1">7</font></a> My soul be your expiation, not only now, but when I shall have attained unto God; for I am yet under danger.</p>  
 <p>9 But the Father is faithful in Jesus Christ, to fulfil both mine and your petition; in whom may ye be found unblamable.</p>
