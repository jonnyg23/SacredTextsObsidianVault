 <p><small>1<i> Declares his joy for their firmness in the Gospel. </i>4<i> Enlarges on the person of Christ, against such as pretend that Christ did not really suffer</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>IGNATIUS, who is also called Theophorus, to the church of God the Father, and of the beloved Jesus Christ, which God hath mercifully  <a name="fr_1056"></a><a href="#fn_1056"><font size="1">4</font></a> blessed with every good gift; being filled with faith and charity, so that this is wanting in no gift; most worthy of God, and fruitful in saints: the church which is at Smyrna in Asia; all joy, through his immaculate spirit, and the word of God.</p>  
 <p>2 I glorify God, even Jesus Christ, who has given you such wisdom.</p>  
 <p>3 For I have observed that</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></a></p>  
 <p>you are settled in an immovable faith, as if you were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit; and are confirmed in love through the blood of Christ; being fully persuaded of those things which relate  <a name="fr_1057"></a><a href="#fn_1057"><font size="1">1</font></a> unto our Lord.</p>  
 <p>4 Who truly was of the race of David according to the flesh, but the Son of God according to the will and power of God; truly born of the Virgin, and baptized of John; that so  <a name="fr_1058"></a><a href="#fn_1058"><font size="1">2</font></a> all righteousness might be fulfilled by him.</p>  
 <p>5 He was also truly crucified by Pontius Pilate, and Herod the Tetrarch, being nailed for us in the flesh; by the fruits of which we are, even by his most blessed passion.</p>  
 <p>6 That he might set  <a name="fr_1059"></a><a href="#fn_1059"><font size="1">3</font></a> up a token for all ages through his resurrection, to all his holy and faithful servants, whether they be Jews or Gentiles, in one body of his church.</p>  
 <p>7 Now all these things he suffered for us that we might be saved. And he suffered truly, as he also truly raised up himself: And not, as some unbelievers say, that he only seemed to suffer, they themselves only seeming to be. <a name="fr_1060"></a><a href="#fn_1060"><font size="1">4</font></a></p>  
 <p>8 And as they believe so shall it happen unto them; when being divested of the body they shall become  <a name="fr_1061"></a><a href="#fn_1061"><font size="1">5</font></a> mere spirits.</p>  
 <p>9 But I know that even after his resurrection he was in the flesh; and I believed that he is still so.</p>  
 <p>10 And when he came to those who were with Peter,  <a name="fr_1062"></a><a href="#fn_1062"><font size="1">6</font></a> he said unto them, Take, handle me, and see that I am not an incorporeal dæmon. And straightway they felt and believed; being convinced both by his flesh and spirit.</p>  
 <p>11 For this cause they despised death, and were found to be above  <a name="fr_1063"></a><a href="#fn_1063"><font size="1">7</font></a> it.</p>  
 <p>12 But after his resurrection he did eat and drink with them, as he was flesh; although as to his Spirit he was united to the Father.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. II.</h4>  
 <p><small>1<i> Exhorts them against heretics. </i>8<i> The danger of their doctrine</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>NOW these things, beloved,  <a name="fr_1064"></a><a href="#fn_1064"><font size="1">8</font></a> put you in mind of, not questioning but that you yourselves also  <a name="fr_1065"></a><a href="#fn_1065"><font size="1">9</font></a> believe that they are so.</p>  
 <p>2 But I arm you before-hand against certain beasts in the shape of men whom you must not only not receive, but if it be possible must not meet with.</p>  
 <p>3 Only you must pray for them, that if it be the will of God they may repent; which yet will be very hard. But of this our Lord Jesus Christ has the power, who is our true life.</p>  
 <p>4 For if all these things were done only in shew by our Lord, then do I also seem only to be bound.</p>  
 <p>5 And why have I given up myself to death, to the fire, to the sword, to wild beasts!</p>  
 <p>6 But now the nearer I am to the sword, the nearer I am to God: when I shall come among the wild beasts, I shall come to God.</p>  
 <p>7 Only in the name of Jesus Christ, I undergo all, to suffer</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>together with him; he who was made a perfect man strengthening me.</p>  
 <p>8 Whom some not knowing, do deny; or rather have been denied by him, being the advocates of death, rather than of the truth. Whom neither the prophecies, nor the law of Moses have persuaded; nor the Gospel itself even to this day, nor the sufferings of every one of us.</p>  
 <p>9 For they think also the same things of us. For what does a man profit me, if he shall praise me, and blaspheme my Lord; not confessing that he  <a name="fr_1066"></a><a href="#fn_1066"><font size="1">1</font></a> was truly made man?</p>  
 <p>10 Now he that doth not say this, does in effect deny him, and is in death. But for the names of such as do this, they being unbelievers, I thought it not fitting to write them unto you.</p>  
 <p>11 Yea, God forbid that I should make any mention of them, till they shall repent to a true belief of Christ's passion, which is our resurrection.</p>  
 <p>12 Let no man deceive himself; both the things which are in heaven and the glorious angels, and princes, whether visible or invisible, if they believe not in the blood of Christ,  <a name="fr_1067"></a><a href="#fn_1067"><font size="1">2</font></a> it shall be to them to condemnation.</p>  
 <p>13  <a name="fr_1068"></a><a href="#fn_1068"><font size="1">3</font></a> He that is able to receive this, let him receive it. Let no man's  <a name="fr_1069"></a><a href="#fn_1069"><font size="1">4</font></a> place or state in the world puff him up: that which is worth all his faith and charity, to which nothing is to be preferred.</p>  
 <p>14 But consider those who are of a different opinion from us, as to what concerns the grace of Jesus Christ which is come unto us, how contrary they are to the design of God.</p>  
 <p>15 They have no regard to charity, no care of the widow, the fatherless, and the oppressed; of the bond or free, of the hungry or thirsty.</p>  
 <p>16 They abstain from the eucharist, and from  <a name="fr_1070"></a><a href="#fn_1070"><font size="1">5</font></a> the public offices; because they confess not the eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ; which suffered for our sins, and which the Father of his goodness, raised again from the dead.</p>  
 <p>17 And for this cause contradicting the gift of God, they die in their disputes:  <a name="fr_1071"></a><a href="#fn_1071"><font size="1">6</font></a> but much better would it be for them to  <a name="fr_1072"></a><a href="#fn_1072"><font size="1">7</font></a> receive it, that they might one day rise through it.</p>  
 <p>18 It will therefore become you to abstain from such persons; and not to speak with them neither in private nor in public.</p>  
 <p>19 But to hearken to the prophets, and especially to the Gospel, in which both Christ's passion is manifested unto us, and his resurrection perfectly declared.</p>  
 <p>20 But flee all divisions, as the beginning of evils.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. III.</h4>  
 <p><small>1<i> Exhorts them to follow their bishop and pastors; but especially their bishop. </i>6<i> Thanks them for their kindness, </i>11<i> and acquaints them with the ceasing of the persecution at Antioch</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>SEE that ye all follow your bishop, as Jesus Christ, the Father; and the presbytery, as the Apostles. And reverence the deacons, as the command of God.</p>  
 <p>2 Let no man do anything of what belongs to the church separately from the bishop.</p>  
 <p>3 Let that eucharist be looked upon as well established, which is either offered by the bishop,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>or by him to whom the bishop has given his consent.</p>  
 <p>4 Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the  <a name="fr_1073"></a><a href="#fn_1073"><font size="1">1</font></a> people also be: as where Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic church.</p>  
 <p>5 It is not lawful without the bishop, neither to baptize, nor  <a name="fr_1074"></a><a href="#fn_1074"><font size="1">2</font></a> to celebrate the Holy Communion; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing unto God; that so whatever is done, may be sure and well done.</p>  
 <p>6 For what remains, it is very reasonable that we should  <a name="fr_1075"></a><a href="#fn_1075"><font size="1">3</font></a> repent whilst there is yet time to return unto God.</p>  
 <p>7 It is a good thing to have a due regard both to God, and to the bishop: he that honours the bishop, shall be honoured of God. But he that does anything without his knowledge,  <a name="fr_1076"></a><a href="#fn_1076"><font size="1">4</font></a> ministers unto the devil.</p>  
 <p>8 Let all things therefore abound to you in charity; seeing that ye are worthy.</p>  
 <p>9 Ye have refreshed me in all things; so shall Jesus Christ you. Ye have loved me both when I was present with you, and now being absent, ye cease not to do so.</p>  
 <p>10 May God be your reward, from whom whilst ye undergo all things, ye shall attain unto him.</p>  
 <p>11 Ye have done well in that ye have received Philo, and Rheus  <a name="fr_1077"></a><a href="#fn_1077"><font size="1">5</font></a> Agathopus, who followed me  <a name="fr_1078"></a><a href="#fn_1078"><font size="1">6</font></a> for the word of God, as the deacons of Christ our God.</p>  
 <p>12 Who also gave thanks unto the Lord for you, forasmuch as ye have refreshed them in all  <a name="fr_1079"></a><a href="#fn_1079"><font size="1">7</font></a> things.  <a name="fr_1080"></a><a href="#fn_1080"><font size="1">8</font></a> Nor shall any thing that you have done be lost to you.</p>  
 <p>13 My  <a name="fr_1081"></a><a href="#fn_1081"><font size="1">9</font></a> soul be for yours, and my bonds which ye have not despised, nor been ashamed of. Wherefore neither shall Jesus Christ, our perfect faith, be ashamed of you.</p>  
 <p>14 Your prayer is come to the church of Antioch which is in Syria. From whence being sent bound with chains becoming God, I salute the  <a name="fr_1082"></a><a href="#fn_1082"><font size="1">10</font></a> churches; being not worthy to be called  <a name="fr_1083"></a><a href="#fn_1083"><font size="1">11</font></a> from thence, as being the least among them.</p>  
 <p>15 Nevertheless by the will of God I have been thought worthy of this honour; not for that I think I have deserved it, but by the grace of God.</p>  
 <p>16 Which I wish may be perfectly given unto me, that through your prayers I may attain unto God.</p>  
 <p>17 And therefore that your work may be fully accomplished both upon earth and in heaven; it will be fitting, and for the honour of God,  <a name="fr_1084"></a><a href="#fn_1084"><font size="1">12</font></a> that your church appoint some worthy delegate, who being come as far as Syria, may rejoice together with them that they are in peace; and that they are again restored to their former  <a name="fr_1085"></a><a href="#fn_1085"><font size="1">13</font></a> state, and have again received their proper body.</p>  
 <p>18 Wherefore I should think it a worthy action, to send some one from you with an epistle, to congratulate with them their peace in God; and that through your prayers they have now gotten to their harbor.</p>  
 <p>19 For inasmuch as ye are perfect yourselves, you ought to think those things that are perfect. For when you are desirous to do well, God is ready to  <a name="fr_1086"></a><a href="#fn_1086"><font size="1">14</font></a> enable you thereunto.</p>

 <p>20 The love of the brethren that are at Troas salute you; from whence I write to you by Burrhus whom you sent with me, together with the Ephesians your brethren; and who has in all things refreshed me.</p>  
 <p>21 And I would to God that all would imitate him, as being a pattern of the ministry of God. May his grace fully reward him.</p>  
 <p>22 I salute your very worthy bishop, and your venerable presbytery; and your deacons, my fellow-servants; and all of you in general, and every one in particular, in the name of Jesus Christ, and in his flesh and blood; in his passion and resurrection both fleshly and spiritually; and in  <a name="fr_1087"></a><a href="#fn_1087"><font size="1">1</font></a> the unity of God with you.</p>  
 <p>23 Grace be with you, and mercy, and peace, and patience, for evermore.</p>  
 <p>24 I salute the families of my brethren, with their wives and children; and the  <a name="fr_1088"></a><a href="#fn_1088"><font size="1">2</font></a> virgins that are called widows. Be strong in the power of the Holy Ghost. Philo, who is present with me salutes you.</p>  
 <p>25 I salute the house of Tavias, and pray that it may be strengthened in faith and charity, both of flesh and spirit.</p>  
 <p>26 I salute Alce my well-beloved,  <a name="fr_1089"></a><a href="#fn_1089"><font size="1">3</font></a> together with the incomparable Daphnus, and Eutechnus, and all by name.</p>  
 <p>27 Farewell in the grace of God.</p>
