 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Tobias Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him, </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife. </p>
