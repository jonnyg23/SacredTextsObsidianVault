 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between buying and selling. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of understanding. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and the sinful man shall have them both. </p>
