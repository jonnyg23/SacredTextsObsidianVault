 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Baruch Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ye were sold to the nations, not for [your] destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning; </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But what can I help you? </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall. </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons. </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation. </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning. </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time. </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God. </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God. </p>
