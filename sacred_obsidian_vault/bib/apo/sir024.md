 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in the midst of her people. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> In the congregation of the most High shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in every people and nation, I got a possession. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide? </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established in Sion. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I took root in an honourable people, even in the portion of the Lord's inheritance. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of honour and grace. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritance than the honeycomb. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they that work by me shall not do amiss. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> All these things are the book of the covenant of the most high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you, cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside him there is no other Saviour. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last find her out. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and my river became a sea. </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off. </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom. </p>
