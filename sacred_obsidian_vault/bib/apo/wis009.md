 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word, </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made, </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart: </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children: </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters: </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is? </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out? </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above? </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom. </p>
