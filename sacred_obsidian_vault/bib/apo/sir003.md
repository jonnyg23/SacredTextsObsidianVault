 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins: </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's dishonour is no glory unto thee. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay. </p>
