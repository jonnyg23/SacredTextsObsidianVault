 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain her. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wife married of a virgin. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and give him the water of wisdom to drink. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; and shall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and sinners shall not see her. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For she is far from pride, and men that are liars cannot remember her. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the Lord will prosper it. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of the sinful man. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God love it not. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel; </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shall be given him. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty in power, and beholdeth all things: </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knoweth every work of man. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to sin. </p>
