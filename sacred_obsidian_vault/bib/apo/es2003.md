 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: 2 Esdras Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart: </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said, </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people, </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will: </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David: </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee, </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart: </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion? </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion? </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob? </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments. </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel. </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments? </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen. </p>
