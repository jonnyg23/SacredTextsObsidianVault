 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: 1 Esdras Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia, </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another; </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory: </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck: </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow; </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The second wrote, The king is strongest. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them: </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers; </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine; </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it: </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich: </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt: </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents: </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords: </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace. </p>
