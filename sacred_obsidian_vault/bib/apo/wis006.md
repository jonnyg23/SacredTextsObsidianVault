 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God; </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love; </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption; </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And incorruption maketh us near unto God: </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good. </p>
