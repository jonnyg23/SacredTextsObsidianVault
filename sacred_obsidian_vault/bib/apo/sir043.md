 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 43</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty of heaven, with his glorious shew; </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, the work of the most High: </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof? </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment runneth hastily. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven; </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have bended it. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind bloweth. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers: </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a breastplate. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refresheth. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islands therein. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of all kinds of beasts and whales created. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by his word all things consist. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great above all his works. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is his power. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who can magnify him as he is? </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works. </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath he given wisdom. </p>
