 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Blessed is the man that hath not slipped with his mouth, and is not pricked with the multitude of sins. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Blessed is he whose conscience hath not condemned him, and who is not fallen from his hope in the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should an envious man do with money? </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in his goods. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> There is none worse than he that envieth himself; and this is a recompence of his wickedness. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And if he doeth good, he doeth it unwillingly; and at the last he will declare his wickedness. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The envious man hath a wicked eye; he turneth away his face, and despiseth men. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; and the iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> A wicked eye envieth [his] bread, and he is a niggard at his table. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> My son, according to thy ability do good to thyself, and give the Lord his due offering. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Remember that death will not be long in coming, and that the covenant of the grave is not shewed unto thee. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Do good unto thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability stretch out thy hand and give to him. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire overpass thee. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? and thy labours to be divided by lot? </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the worker thereof shall go withal. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Blessed is the man that doth meditate good things in wisdom, and that reasoneth of holy things by his understanding. ing. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He that considereth her ways in his heart shall also have understanding in her secrets. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Go after her as one that traceth, and lie in wait in her ways. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He that prieth in at her windows shall also hearken at her doors. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He that doth lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin in her walls. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> By her he shall be covered from heat, and in her glory shall he dwell. </p>
