 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him? </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways! </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you? </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight, </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy. </p>
