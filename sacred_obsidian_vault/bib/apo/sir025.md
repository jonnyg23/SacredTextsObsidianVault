 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 25</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age? </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel! </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy: </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself: </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear: </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened? </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> [Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go. </p>
