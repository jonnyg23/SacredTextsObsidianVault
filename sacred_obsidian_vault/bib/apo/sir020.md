 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both? </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom. </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide. </p>
