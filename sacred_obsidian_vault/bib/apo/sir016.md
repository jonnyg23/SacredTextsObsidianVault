 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins: </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be known to the world. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hath separated his light from the darkness with an adamant. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures? </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways? </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagineth follies. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> With all manner of living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again. </p>
