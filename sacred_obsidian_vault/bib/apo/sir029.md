 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his neighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety: </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [in danger] that delivered him. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth other men's business for gain shall fall into suits. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the same. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man's house. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words: </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender. </p>
