 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life? </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty? </p>
