 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Wisdom Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves; </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites; </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury, </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt. </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness. </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly. </p>
