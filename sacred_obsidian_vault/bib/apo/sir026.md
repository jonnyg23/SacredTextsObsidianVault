 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, and she will not cover her own shame. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against thee. </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thy strength to strangers. </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock. </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent. </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her husband. </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband. </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord. </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all. </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies. </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third maketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returneth from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword. </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin. </p>
