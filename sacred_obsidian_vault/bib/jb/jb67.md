 <p align="center"><small><i>Judas Conducts the Officers to Jesus</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>WHEN Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</p>  
 <p>2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</p>  
 <p>3 Judas then, having received a band of <i>men</i> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</p>  
 <p>4 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>  
 <p>5 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>  
 <p>6 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
