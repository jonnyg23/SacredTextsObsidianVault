 <p>2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</p>  
 <p>3 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>  
 <p>4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>  
 <p>5 ¶ Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan;</p>  
 <p>6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
