 <p>THERE came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</p>  
 <p>2 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p>  
 <p>3 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</p>
