 <p align="center"><small><i>He Baptizes, but Retires into Galilee on the Death of John</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>AFTER these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>  
 <p>2 ¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</p>  
 <p>3 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</p>  
 <p>4 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</p>  
 <p>5 Therefore Herodias 'had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</p>  
 <p>6 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</p>  
 <p>7 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief <i>estates</i> of Galilee;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>8 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give <i>it</i> thee.</p>  
 <p>9 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give <i>it</i> thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</p>  
 <p>10 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</p>  
 <p>11 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</p>  
 <p>12 And the king was exceeding sorry; <i>yet</i> for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</p>  
 <p>13 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</p>  
 <p>14 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</p>
