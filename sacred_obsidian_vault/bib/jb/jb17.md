 <p>AND one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</p>  
 <p>2 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at meat in</p>

 <p>the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>  
 <p>3 And stood at his feet behind <i>him</i> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i>them</i> with the ointment.</p>  
 <p>4 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <i>it</i>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <i>this is</i> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>  
 <p>5 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>  
 <p>6 There was a. certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>  
 <p>7 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>  
 <p>8 Simon <a href="errata.htm#1">answered</a> and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>

 <p>9 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head.</p>  
 <p>10 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>  
 <p>11 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>  
 <p>12 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loveth little.</p>  
 <p>13 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>  
 <p>14 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>  
 <p>15 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>
