 <p>AND when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</p>  
 <p>2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose <i>them</i>, and bring <i>them</i> unto me.</p>  
 <p>3 And if any <i>man</i> say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>  
 <p>4 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</p>  
 <p>5 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set <i>him</i> thereon.</p>

 <p>6 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed <i>them</i> in the way.</p>  
 <p>7 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</p>  
 <p>8 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>  
 <p>9 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</p>  
 <p>10 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>  
 <p>11 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</p>  
 <p>12 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>  
 <p>13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>  
 <p>14 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</p>
