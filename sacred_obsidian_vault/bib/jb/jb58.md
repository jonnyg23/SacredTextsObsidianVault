 <p>AND Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p>  
 <p>2 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</p>  
 <p>3 And he called <i>unto him</i> his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p>  
 <p>4 For all <i>they</i> did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <i>even</i> all her living.</p>
