 <p>AND they came again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there came to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,</p>  
 <p>2 And they answered Jesus and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>  
 <p>3 But what think ye? A <i>certain</i> man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.</p>  
 <p>4 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</p>  
 <p>5 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said I <i>go</i>, sir: and went not.</p>  
 <p>6 Whether of them twain did the will of <i>his</i> father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</p>
