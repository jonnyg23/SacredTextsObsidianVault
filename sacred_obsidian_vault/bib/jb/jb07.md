 <p>AND the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</p>  
 <p>2 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</p>  
 <p>3 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not <i>of it</i>.</p>  
 <p>4 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among <i>their</i> kinsfolk and acquaintance.</p>  
 <p>5 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</p>  
 <p>6 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</p>

 <p>7 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</p>  
 <p>8 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</p>  
 <p>9 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</p>  
 <p>10 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</p>
