  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Job</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> A man there hath been in the land of Uz -- Job his name --  and that man hath been perfect and upright -- both fearing God,  and turning aside from evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And there are borne to him seven sons and three daughters,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> and his substance is seven thousand sheep, and three  thousand camels, and five hundred pairs of oxen, and five  hundred she-asses, and a service very abundant; and that man is  greater than any of the sons of the east.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And his sons have gone and made a banquet -- the house of  each [in] his day -- and have sent and called to their three  sisters to eat and to drink with them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and it cometh to pass, when they have gone round the days of  the banquet, that Job doth send and sanctify them, and hath  risen early in the morning, and caused to ascend  burnt-offerings -- the number of them all -- for Job said,  `Perhaps my sons have sinned, yet blessed God in their heart.'  Thus doth Job all the days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And the day is, that sons of God come in to station  themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary  in their midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence comest thou?'  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down on it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy  heart against My servant Job because there is none like him in  the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God, and turning  aside from evil?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `For nought  is Job fearing God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Hast not Thou made a hedge for him, and for his house, and  for all that he hath -- round about?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, and his substance  hath spread in the land, and yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy  hand, and strike against anything that he hath -- if not: to  Thy face he doth bless Thee!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, all that he hath  [is] in thy hand, only unto him put not forth thy hand.' And  the Adversary goeth out from the presence of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And the day is, that his sons and his daughters are eating,  and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the  first-born.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And a messenger hath come in unto Job and saith, `The oxen  have been plowing, and the she-asses feeding by their sides,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> and Sheba doth fall, and take them, and the young men they  have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped --  only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Fire of God hath fallen from the heavens, and burneth  among the flock, and among the young men, and consumeth them,  and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Chaldeans made three heads, and rush on the camels, and  take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of  the sword, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare [it]  to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Thy sons and thy daughters are eating, and drinking  wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And lo, a great wind hath come from over the wilderness,  and striketh against the four corners of the house, and it  falleth on the young men, and they are dead, and I am escaped  -- only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And Job riseth, and rendeth his robe, and shaveth his head,  and falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> and he saith, `Naked came I forth from the womb of my  mother, and naked I turn back thither: Jehovah hath given and  Jehovah hath taken: let the name of Jehovah be blessed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> In all this Job hath not sinned, nor given folly to God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And the day is, that sons of God come in to station  themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary  in their midst to station himself by Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence camest thou?'  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down in it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy  heart unto My servant Job because there is none like him in the  land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God and turning aside  from evil? and still he is keeping hold on his integrity, and  thou dost move Me against him to swallow him up for nought!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `A skin for a  skin, and all that a man hath he doth give for his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike unto his  bone and unto his flesh -- if not: unto Thy face he doth bless  Thee!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, he [is] in thy  hand; only his life take care of.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And the Adversary goeth forth from the presence of Jehovah,  and smiteth Job with a sore ulcer from the sole of his foot  unto his crown.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And he taketh to him a potsherd to scrape himself with it,  and he is sitting in the midst of the ashes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And his wife saith to him, `Still thou art keeping hold on  thine integrity: bless God and die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And he saith unto her, `As one of the foolish women  speaketh, thou speakest; yea, the good we receive from God, and  the evil we do not receive.' In all this Job hath not sinned  with his lips.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And three of the friends of Job hear of all this evil that  hath come upon him, and they come in each from his place --  Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the  Naamathite -- and they are met together to come in to bemoan  him, and to comfort him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and they lift up their eyes from afar and have not  discerned him, and they lift up their voice and weep, and rend  each his robe, and sprinkle dust on their heads -- heavenward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And they sit with him on the earth seven days and seven  nights, and there is none speaking unto him a word when they  have seen that the pain hath been very great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And Job answereth and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that  hath said: `A man-child hath been conceived.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> That day -- let it be darkness, Let not God require it from  above, Nor let light shine upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud  tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of  days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> That night -- let thick darkness take it, Let it not be  united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it  not come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Lo! that night -- let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up  Leviathan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for  light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of  the dawn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was  mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come  forth and gasp!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Wherefore have knees been before me? And what [are] breasts,  that I suck?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept --  then there is rest to me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes  for themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Or with princes -- they have gold, They are filling their  houses [with] silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> (Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants -- they have  not seen light.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do  the wearied in power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard  the voice of an exactor,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Small and great [are] there the same. And a servant [is]  free from his lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the  bitter soul?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it  above hid treasures.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Who are glad -- unto joy, They rejoice when they find a  grave.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut  up?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as  waters [are] my roarings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was  afraid of doth come to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> I was not safe -- nor was I quiet -- Nor was I at rest --  and trouble cometh!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to  keep in words who is able?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest  strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees  thou dost strengthen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It  striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the  perfection of thy ways?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished?  And where have the upright been cut off?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of  misery, reap it!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of  His anger consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And  teeth of young lions have been broken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of  the lioness do separate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth  mine ear a little of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of  deep sleep on men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my  bones caused to fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the  hair of my flesh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude  [is] over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> `Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a  man cleaner?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His  messengers setteth praise.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose  foundation [is] in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any  regarding, for ever they perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die,  and not in wisdom!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of  the holy ones dost thou turn?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to  death the simple,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> I -- I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his  habitation straightway,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the  gate, And there is no deliverer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns  taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the  ground springeth up misery.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Yet I -- I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful,  till there is no numbering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending  waters on the out-places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been  high [in] safety.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not  execute wisdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of  wrestling ones was hastened,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> By day they meet darkness, And as night -- they grope at  noon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a  strong hand the needy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut  her mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And  the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His  hands heal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil  striketh not on thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle  from the hands of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not  afraid of destruction, When it cometh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast  of the earth, Thou art not afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> (For with sons of the field [is] thy covenant, And the  beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And thou hast known that thy tent [is] peace, And inspected  thy habitation, and errest not,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And hast known that numerous [is] Thy seed, And thine  offspring as the herb of the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of  a stalk in its season.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> Lo, this -- we searched it out -- it [is] right, hearken;  And thou, know for thyself!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And Job answereth and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> O that my provocation were thoroughly weighed, And my  calamity in balances They would lift up together!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> For now, than the sands of the sea it is heavier, Therefore  my words have been rash.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> For arrows of the Mighty [are] with me, Whose poison is  drinking up my spirit. Terrors of God array themselves [for]  me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Brayeth a wild ass over tender grass? Loweth an ox over his  provender?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Eaten is an insipid thing without salt? Is there sense in  the drivel of dreams?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> My soul is refusing to touch! They [are] as my sickening  food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> O that my request may come, That God may grant my hope!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> That God would please -- and bruise me, Loose His hand and  cut me off!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And yet it is my comfort, (And I exult in pain -- He doth  not spare,) That I have not hidden The sayings of the Holy One.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> What [is] my power that I should hope? And what mine end  That I should prolong my life?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh brazen?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> Is not my help with me, And substance driven from me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> To a despiser of his friends [is] shame, And the fear of  the Mighty he forsaketh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> My brethren have deceived as a brook, As a stream of brooks  they pass away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> That are black because of ice, By them doth snow hide  itself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> By the time they are warm they have been cut off, By its  being hot they have been Extinguished from their place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> Turn aside do the paths of their way, They ascend into  emptiness, and are lost.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> Passengers of Tema looked expectingly, Travellers of Sheba  hoped for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> They were ashamed that one hath trusted, They have come  unto it and are confounded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Surely now ye have become the same! Ye see a downfall, and  are afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> Is it because I said, Give to me? And, By your power bribe  for me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And, Deliver me from the hand of an adversary? And, From  the hand of terrible ones ransom me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> Shew me, and I -- I keep silent, And what I have erred, let  me understand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> How powerful have been upright sayings, And what doth  reproof from you reprove?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> For reproof -- do you reckon words? And for wind -- sayings  of the desperate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> Anger on the fatherless ye cause to fall, And are strange  to your friend.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> And, now, please, look upon me, Even to your face do I lie?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> Turn back, I pray you, let it not be perverseness, Yea,  turn back again -- my righteousness [is] in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> Is there in my tongue perverseness? Discerneth not my  palate desirable things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of  an hireling his days?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling  expecteth his wage,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And  nights of misery they numbered to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> If I lay down then I said, `When do I rise!' And evening  hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Clothed hath been my flesh [with] worms, And a clod of dust,  My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are  consumed without hope.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Remember Thou that my life [is] a breath, Mine eye turneth  not back to see good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes [are]  upon me -- and I am not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going  down to Sheol cometh not up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place  discern him again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Also I -- I withhold not my mouth -- I speak in the  distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> A sea-[monster] am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over  me a guard?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> When I said, `My bed doth comfort me,' He taketh away in my  talking my couch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions  thou terrifiest me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my  bones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> I have wasted away -- not to the age do I live. Cease from  me, for my days [are] vanity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> What [is] man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou  settest unto him Thy heart?</p>

 <p><a name="an_28:27">28:27</a> Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it,  and also searched it out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:28">28:28</a> And He saith to man: -- `Lo, fear of the Lord, that [is]  wisdom, And to turn from evil [is] understanding.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> Who doth make me as [in] months past, As [in] the days of  God's preserving me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I  walk [through] darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of  God upon my tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> When yet the Mighty One [is] with me. Round about me -- my  young ones,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock [is]  with me rivulets of oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I  prepare my seat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged  have risen -- they stood up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their  mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to  the palate hath cleaved.</p>

 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the  fatherless who hath no helper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart  of the widow I cause to sing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe  and a diadem my justice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame [am]  I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> A father I [am] to the needy, And the cause I have not  known I search out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his  teeth I cast away prey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> And I say, `With my nest I expire, And as the sand I  multiply days.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent  for my counsel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech  drop,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> And they wait as [for] rain for me, And their mouth they  have opened wide [As] for the latter rain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> I laugh unto them -- they give no credence, And the light  of my face cause not to fall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in  a troop, When mourners he doth comfort.</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> Also -- the power of their hands, why [is it] to me? On  them hath old age perished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry  place, Formerly a desolation and waste,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots [is]  their food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them  as a thief),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth  and clefts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered  together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> Sons of folly -- even sons without name, They have been  smitten from the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a  byword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And  from before me have not spared to spit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the  bridle from before me, They have cast away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have  cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of  calamity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit,  `He hath no helper.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have  rolled themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind  mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed  away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do  days of affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids  do not lie down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the  mouth of my coat it doth gird me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have  stood, and Thou dost consider me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of  Thy hand, Thou oppresest me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to  ride, And Thou meltest -- Thou levellest me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And  [to] the house appointed for all living.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand,  Though in its ruin they have safety.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my  soul for the needy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> When good I expected, then cometh evil, And I wait for  light, and darkness cometh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me  have days of affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:28">30:28</a> Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an  assembly I cry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to  daughters of the ostrich.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned  from heat,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound  of weeping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what -- do I attend to  a virgin?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> And what [is] the portion of God from above? And the  inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers  of iniquity?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to  deceit,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know  my integrity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine  eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Let me sow -- and another eat, And my products let be  rooted out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening  of my neighbour I laid wait,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others  bend.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> For it [is] a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> For a fire it [is], to destruction it consumeth, And among  all mine increase doth take root,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my  handmaid, In their contending with me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth  inspect, What do I answer Him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare  us in the womb doth One.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the  widow do consume,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not  eat of it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> (But from my youth He grew up with me as [with] a father,  And from the belly of my mother I am led.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> If I see [any] perishing without clothing, And there is no  covering to the needy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of  my sheep He doth not warm himself,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in  [him] the gate of my court,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the  bone be broken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> For a dread unto me [is] calamity [from] God, And because  of His excellency I am not able.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold  have said, `My trust,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> If I rejoice because great [is] my wealth, And because  abundance hath my hand found,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon  walking,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss  my mouth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> It also [is] a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God  above.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up  myself when evil found him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an  oath his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> If not -- say ye, O men of my tent, `O that we had of his  flesh, we are not satisfied.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:32">31:32</a> In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the  traveller I open.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:33">31:33</a> If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my  bosom mine iniquity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:34">31:34</a> Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of  families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of  the opening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:35">31:35</a> Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One  doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:36">31:36</a> If not -- on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown  on myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:37">31:37</a> The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach  Him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:38">31:38</a> If against me my land doth cry out, And together its  furrows weep,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:39">31:39</a> If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of  its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:40">31:40</a> Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of  barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> And these three men cease from answering Job, for he [is]  righteous in his own eyes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the  Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger  burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> and against his three friends hath his anger burned,  because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for  they are older than he in days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the  three men, and his anger burneth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith:  -- Young I [am] in days, and ye [are] age Therefore I have  feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One  Doth cause them to understand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand  judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion  -- even I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your  reasons, Till ye search out sayings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for  Job, [Or] answerer of his sayings among you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him  away, not man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your  sayings I do not answer him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> (They have broken down, They have not answered again, They  removed from themselves words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have  stood still, They have not answered any more.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> I answer, even I -- my share, I shew my opinion -- even I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the  spirit of my breast,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> Lo, my breast [is] as wine not opened, Like new bottles it  is broken up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips  and answer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto  man give flattering titles,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a  little doth my Maker take me away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and [to] all my  words give ear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath  spoken in the palate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> Of the uprightness of my heart [are] my sayings, And  knowledge have my lips clearly spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the  Mighty doth quicken me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> If thou art able -- answer me, Set in array before me --  station thyself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> Lo, I [am], according to thy word, for God, From the clay I  -- I also, have been formed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee  is not heavy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> Surely -- thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of  words I hear:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> `Pure [am] I, without transgression, Innocent [am] I, and I  have no iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me  for an enemy to Him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my  paths.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Lo, [in] this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee,  that greater is God than man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When [for] all  His matters He answereth not?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold  it.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> In a dream -- a vision of night, In the falling of deep  sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their  instruction sealeth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> To turn aside man [from] doing, And pride from man He  concealeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life  from passing away by a dart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the  strife of his bones [is] enduring.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable  food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his  bones, they were not seen!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to  those causing death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter -- one of a  thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> Then He doth favour him and saith, `Ransom him from going  down to the pit, I have found an atonement.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> Fresher [is] his flesh than a child's, He returneth to the  days of his youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:26">33:26</a> He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him.  And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man  His righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:27">33:27</a> He looketh on men, and saith, `I sinned, And uprightness I  have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:28">33:28</a> He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And  my life on the light looketh.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:29">33:29</a> Lo, all these doth God work, Twice -- thrice with man,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:30">33:30</a> To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened  with the light of the living.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:31">33:31</a> Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I -- I do  speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:32">33:32</a> If there are words -- answer me, Speak, for I have a  desire to justify thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:33">33:33</a> If there are not -- hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I  teach thee wisdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And Elihu answereth and saith:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear  to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among  ourselves what [is] good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> For Job hath said, `I have been righteous, And God hath  turned aside my right,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> Against my right do I lie? Mortal [is] mine arrow --  without transgression.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> Who [is] a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity,  So as to go with men of wickedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> For he hath said, `It doth not profit a man, When he  delighteth himself with God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from  God to do wickedness, And [from] the Mighty to do perverseness:</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth  not pervert judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath  placed all the habitable world?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath  unto Him He gathereth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of  iniquity to be hidden there;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:23">34:23</a> For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in  judgment,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth  others in their stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned  by night, And they are bruised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:26">34:26</a> As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of  beholders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:27">34:27</a> Because that against right They have turned aside from  after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,</p>

 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the  face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to  a man, [It is] the same.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:30">34:30</a> From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a  people;</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And Elihu answereth and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said -- `My  righteousness [is] more than God's?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> For thou sayest, `What doth it profit Thee! What do I  profit from my sin?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> Behold attentively the heavens -- and see, And behold the  clouds, They have been higher than thou.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy  transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> For a man like thyself [is] thy wickedness, And for a son  of man thy righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry  out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> And none said, `Where [is] God my maker? Giving songs in  the night,</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the  pride of evil doers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not  behold it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment  [is] before Him, and stay for Him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His  anger, And He hath not known in great extremity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> And Job [with] vanity doth open his mouth, Without  knowledge words he multiplieth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And Elihu addeth and saith: --</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe  righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> For, truly, my words [are] not false, The perfect in  knowledge [is] with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> Lo, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty [in] power  [and] heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor  appointeth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And [from]  kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they  are high,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of  affliction,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> Then He declareth to them their work, And their  transgressions, Because they have become mighty,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith  that they turn back from iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in  good, And their years in pleasantness.</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when  He hath bound them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the  defiled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And  uncovereth in oppression their ear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> And also He moved thee from a strait place, [To] a broad  place -- no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy  table Hath been full of fatness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled,  Judgment and justice are upheld -- because of fury,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an  atonement turn thee not aside.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces  of power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their  stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> Take heed -- do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou  hast fixed Rather than [on] affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who [is] like Him  -- a teacher?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:23">36:23</a> Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, `Thou  hast done iniquity?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:24">36:24</a> Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:25">36:25</a> All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from  afar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:26">36:26</a> Lo, God [is] high, And we know not the number of His  years, Yea, there [is] no searching.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:27">36:27</a> When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine  rain according to its vapour,</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:29">36:29</a> Yea, doth [any] understand The spreadings out of a cloud?  The noises of His tabernacle?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:30">36:30</a> Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the  sea He hath covered,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:31">36:31</a> For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in  abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:32">36:32</a> By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a  charge over it in meeting,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:33">36:33</a> He sheweth by it [to] his friend substance, Anger against  perversity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:1">37:1</a> Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its  place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:2">37:2</a> Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the  sound from His mouth goeth forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:3">37:3</a> Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light [is]  over the skirts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:4">37:4</a> After it roar doth a voice -- He thundereth with the voice  of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His  voice is heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:5">37:5</a> God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great  things and we know not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:6">37:6</a> For to snow He saith, `Be [on] the earth.' And the small  rain and great rain of His power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:7">37:7</a> Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by  all men of His work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its  habitations it doth continue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from  scatterings winds -- cold,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of  waters is straitened,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud  doth His light.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their  doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness -- He  doth cause it to come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to  shine the light of His cloud?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:16">37:16</a> Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of  the Perfect in knowledge?</p>

 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds --  strong as a hard mirror!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array  because of darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken,  surely he is swallowed up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it [is] in  the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:22">37:22</a> From the golden north it cometh, Beside God [is] fearful  honour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:23">37:23</a> The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and  judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:  --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:2">38:2</a> Who [is] this -- darkening counsel, By words without  knowledge?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and  cause thou Me to know.</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth,  from the womb it goeth out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its  swaddling band,</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> And say, `Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command  is placed On the pride of thy billows.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station  themselves as clothed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm  lifted up is broken.</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:18">38:18</a> Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of  earth! Declare -- if thou hast known it all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:19">38:19</a> Where [is] this -- the way light dwelleth? And darkness,  where [is] this -- its place?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:20">38:20</a> That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou  dost understand The paths of its house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> Thou hast known -- for then thou art born And the number  of thy days [are] many!</p>

 <p><a name="an_39:28">39:28</a> A rock he doth inhabit, Yea, he lodgeth on the tooth of a  rock, and fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:29">39:29</a> From thence he hath sought food, To a far off place his  eyes look attentively,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:30">39:30</a> And his brood gulph up blood, And where the pierced [are]  -- there [is] he!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:1">40:1</a> And Jehovah doth answer Job, and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:2">40:2</a> Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of  God, let him answer it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:3">40:3</a> And Job answereth Jehovah, and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:4">40:4</a> Lo, I have been vile, What do I return to Thee? My hand I  have placed on my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:5">40:5</a> Once I have spoken, and I answer not, And twice, and I add  not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:6">40:6</a> And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:  --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:7">40:7</a> Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, I ask thee, and  cause thou Me to know.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:8">40:8</a> Dost thou also make void My judgment? Dost thou condemn Me,  That thou mayest be righteous?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:9">40:9</a> And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him  dost thou thunder?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:10">40:10</a> Put on, I pray thee, excellency and loftiness, Yea, honour  and beauty put on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:11">40:11</a> Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger, And see every  proud one, and make him low.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:12">40:12</a> See every proud one -- humble him, And tread down the  wicked in their place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:13">40:13</a> Hide them in the dust together, Their faces bind in  secret.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:14">40:14</a> And even I -- I do praise thee, For thy right hand giveth  salvation to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:15">40:15</a> Lo, I pray thee, Behemoth, that I made with thee: Grass as  an ox he eateth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:16">40:16</a> Lo, I pray thee, his power [is] in his loins, And his  strength in the muscles of his belly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:17">40:17</a> He doth bend his tail as a cedar, The sinews of his thighs  are wrapped together,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:18">40:18</a> His bones [are] tubes of brass, His bones [are] as a bar  of iron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:19">40:19</a> He [is] a beginning of the ways of God, His Maker bringeth  nigh his sword;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:20">40:20</a> For food do mountains bear for him, And all the beasts of  the field play there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:21">40:21</a> Under shades he lieth down, In a secret place of reed and  mire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:22">40:22</a> Cover him do shades, [with] their shadow, Cover him do  willows of the brook.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:23">40:23</a> Lo, a flood oppresseth -- he doth not haste, He is  confident though Jordan Doth come forth unto his mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:24">40:24</a> Before his eyes doth [one] take him, With snares doth  [one] pierce the nose?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:1">41:1</a> Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope  thou lettest down -- his tongue?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:2">41:2</a> Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce  his jaw?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:3">41:3</a> Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak  unto thee tender things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:4">41:4</a> Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a  servant age-during?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:5">41:5</a> Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him  for thy damsels?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:6">41:6</a> (Feast upon him do companions, They divide him among the  merchants!)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:7">41:7</a> Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with  fish-spears his head?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:8">41:8</a> Place on him thy hand, Remember the battle -- do not add!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:9">41:9</a> Lo, the hope of him is found a liar, Also at his appearance  is not one cast down?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:10">41:10</a> None so fierce that he doth awake him, And who [is] he  before Me stationeth himself?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:11">41:11</a> Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole  heavens it [is] mine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:12">41:12</a> I do not keep silent concerning his parts, And the matter  of might, And the grace of his arrangement.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:13">41:13</a> Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his  double bridle who doth enter?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:14">41:14</a> The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his  teeth [are] terrible.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:15">41:15</a> A pride -- strong ones of shields, Shut up -- a close  seal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:16">41:16</a> One unto another they draw nigh, And air doth not enter  between them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:17">41:17</a> One unto another they adhere, They stick together and are  not separated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:18">41:18</a> His sneezings cause light to shine, And his eyes [are] as  the eyelids of the dawn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:19">41:19</a> Out of his mouth do flames go, sparks of fire escape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:20">41:20</a> Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke, As a blown pot and  reeds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:21">41:21</a> His breath setteth coals on fire, And a flame from his  mouth goeth forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:22">41:22</a> In his neck lodge doth strength, And before him doth grief  exult.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:23">41:23</a> The flakes of his flesh have adhered -- Firm upon him --  it is not moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:24">41:24</a> His heart [is] firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the lower  piece.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:25">41:25</a> From his rising are the mighty afraid, From breakings  they keep themselves free.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:26">41:26</a> The sword of his overtaker standeth not, Spear -- dart --  and lance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:27">41:27</a> He reckoneth iron as straw, brass as rotten wood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:28">41:28</a> The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee, Turned by  him into stubble are stones of the sling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:29">41:29</a> As stubble have darts been reckoned, And he laugheth at  the shaking of a javelin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:30">41:30</a> Under him [are] sharp points of clay, He spreadeth gold on  the mire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:31">41:31</a> He causeth to boil as a pot the deep, The sea he maketh as  a pot of ointment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:32">41:32</a> After him he causeth a path to shine, One thinketh the  deep to be hoary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:33">41:33</a> There is not on the earth his like, That is made without  terror.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:34">41:34</a> Every high thing he doth see, He [is] king over all sons  of pride.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:1">42:1</a> And Job answereth Jehovah and saith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:2">42:2</a> Thou hast known that [for] all things Thou art able, And  not withheld from Thee is [any] device:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:3">42:3</a> `Who [is] this, hiding counsel without knowledge?'  Therefore, I have declared, and understand not, Too wonderful  for me, and I know not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:4">42:4</a> `Hear, I pray thee, and I -- I do speak, I ask thee, and  cause thou me to know.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:5">42:5</a> By the hearing of the ear I heard Thee, And now mine eye  hath seen Thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:6">42:6</a> Therefore do I loathe [it], And I have repented on dust and  ashes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:7">42:7</a> And it cometh to pass after Jehovah's speaking these words  unto Job, that Jehovah saith unto Eliphaz the Temanite, `Burned  hath Mine anger against thee, and against thy two friends,  because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My  servant Job.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:8">42:8</a> And now, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go  ye unto My servant Job, and ye have caused a burnt-offering to  ascend for you; and Job My servant doth pray for you, for  surely his face I accept, so as not to do with you folly,  because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My  servant Job.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:9">42:9</a> And they go -- Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the  Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite -- and do as Jehovah hath spoken  unto them; and Jehovah doth accept the face of Job.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:10">42:10</a> And Jehovah hath turned [to] the captivity of Job in his  praying for his friends, and Jehovah doth add [to] all that Job  hath -- to double.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:11">42:11</a> And come unto him do all his brethren, and all his  sisters, and all his former acquaintances, and they eat bread  with him in his house, and bemoan him, and comfort him  concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him, and  they gave to him each one kesitah, and each one ring of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:12">42:12</a> And Jehovah hath blessed the latter end of Job more than  his beginning, and he hath fourteen thousand of a flock, and six  thousand camels, and a thousand pairs of oxen, and a thousand  she-asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:13">42:13</a> And he hath seven sons and three daughters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:14">42:14</a> and he calleth the name of the one Jemima, and the name of  the second Kezia, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:15">42:15</a> And there have not been found women fair as the daughters  of Job in all the land, and their father doth give to them an  inheritance in the midst of their brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:16">42:16</a> And Job liveth after this a hundred and forty years, and  seeth his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:17">42:17</a> and Job dieth, aged and satisfied [with] days.</p>
