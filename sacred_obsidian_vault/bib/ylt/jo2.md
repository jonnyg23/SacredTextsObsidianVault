  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: 2 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I  love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known  the truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us  shall be to the age,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the  Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,  in truth and love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children  walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the  Father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new  command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love  one another,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> and this is the love, that we may walk according to His  commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the  beginning, that in it ye may walk,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> because many leading astray did enter into the world, who  are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is  he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we  wrought, but a full reward may receive;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the  teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in  the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and  the Son;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not  bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him,  `Hail!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> for he who is saying to him, `Hail,' hath fellowship with  his evil works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Many things having to write to you, I did not intend  through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak  mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> salute thee do the children of thy choice sister. Amen.</p>
