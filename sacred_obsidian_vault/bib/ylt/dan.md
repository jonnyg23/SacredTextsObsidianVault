  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Daniel</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah,  come hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and  layeth siege against it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and the Lord giveth into his hand Jehoiakim king of Judah,  and some of the vessels of the house of God, and he bringeth  them in [to] the land of Shinar, [to] the house of his god, and  the vessels he hath brought in [to] the treasure-house of his  god.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And the king saith, to Ashpenaz master of his eunuchs, to  bring in out of the sons of Israel, (even of the royal seed,  and of the chiefs,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> lads in whom there is no blemish, and of good appearance,  and skilful in all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and  teaching thought, and who have ability to stand in the palace  of the king, and to teach them the literature and language of  the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And the king doth appoint for them a rate, day by day, of  the king's portion of food, and of the wine of his drinking, so  as to nourish them three years, that at the end thereof they  may stand before the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And there are among them out of the sons of Judah, Daniel,  Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and the chief of the eunuchs setteth names on them, and he  setteth on Daniel, Belteshazzar; and on Hananiah, Shadrach; and  on Mishael, Meshach; and on Azariah, Abed-Nego.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And Daniel purposeth in his heart that he will not pollute  himself with the king's portion of food, and with the wine of  his drinking, and he seeketh of the chief of the eunuchs that  he may not pollute himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And God giveth Daniel for kindness and for mercies before  the chief of the eunuchs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> and the chief of the eunuchs saith to Daniel, `I am fearing  my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink,  for why doth he see your faces sadder than [those of] the lads  which [are] of your circle? then ye have made my head indebted  to the king,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And Daniel saith unto the Meltzar, whom the chief of the  eunuchs hath appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and  Azariah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> `Try, I pray thee, thy servants, ten days; and they give to  us of the vegetables, and we eat, and water, and we drink;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and our appearance is seen before thee, and the appearance  of the lads who are eating the king's portion of food, and as  thou seest -- deal with thy servants.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And he hearkeneth to them, to this word, and trieth them  ten days:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> and at the end of ten days their appearance hath appeared  better and fatter in flesh then any of the lads who are eating  the king's portion of food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And the Meltzar is taking away their portion of food, and  the wine of their drink, and is giving to them vegetables.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> As to these four lads, God hath given to them knowledge and  understanding in every [kind of] literature, and wisdom; and  Daniel hath given instruction about every [kind of] vision and  dreams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring  them in, bring them in doth the chief of the eunuchs before  Nebuchadnezzar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And the king speaketh with them, and there hath none been  found among them all like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and  Azariah, and they stand before the king;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> and [in] any matter of wisdom [and] understanding that the  king hath sought of them, he findeth them ten hands above all  the scribes, the enchanters, who [are] in all his kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And Daniel is unto the first year of Cyrus the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,  dreamed hath Nebuchadnezzar dreams, and his spirit doth move  itself, and his sleep hath been against him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and the king saith to call for scribes, and for enchanters,  and for sorcerers, and for Chaldeans, to declare to the king  his dreams. And they come in and stand before the king;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and the king saith to them, `A dream I have dreamed, and  moved is my spirit to know the dream.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the Chaldeans speak to the king [in] Aramaean, `O king,  to the ages live, tell the dream to thy servants, and the  interpretation we do shew.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> The king hath answered and said to the Chaldeans, `The thing  from me is gone; if ye do not cause me to know the dream and  its interpretation, pieces ye are made, and your houses are  made dunghills;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and if the dream and its interpretation ye do shew, gifts,  and fee, and great glory ye receive from before me, therefore  the dream and its interpretation shew ye me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> They have answered a second time, and are saying, `Let the  king tell the dream to his servants, and the interpretation we  do shew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> The king hath answered and said, `Of a truth I know that  time ye are gaining, because that ye have seen that the thing  is gone from me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> [so] that, if the dream ye do not cause me to know -- one is  your sentence, seeing a word lying and corrupt ye have prepared  to speak before me, till that the time is changed, therefore  the dream tell ye to me, then do I know that its interpretation  ye do shew me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> The Chaldeans have answered before the king, and are  saying, `There is not a man on the earth who is able to shew  the king's matter; therefore, no king, chief, and ruler, hath  asked such a thing as this of any scribe, and enchanter, and  Chaldean;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> and the thing that the king is asking [is] precious, and  others are there not that do shew it before the king, save the  gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Therefore the king hath been angry and very wroth, and hath  said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And the sentence hath gone forth, and the wise men are  being slain, and they have sought Daniel and his companions to  be slain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Then Daniel hath replied [with] counsel and discretion to  Arioch chief of the executioners of the king, who hath gone  forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> He hath answered and said to Arioch the king's captain,  `Wherefore [is] the sentence so urgent from before the king?'  Then Arioch hath made the thing known to Daniel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and Daniel hath gone up, and sought of the king that he  would give him time to shew the interpretation to the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Then Daniel to his house hath gone, and to Hananiah,  Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, he hath made the thing  known,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> and to seek mercies from before the God of the heavens  concerning this secret, that they destroy not Daniel and his  companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> Then to Daniel, in a vision of the night, the secret hath  been revealed. Then hath Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> Daniel hath answered and said, `Let the name of God be  blessed from age even unto age, for wisdom and might -- for  they are His.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And He is changing times and seasons, He is causing kings  to pass away, and He is raising up kings; He is giving wisdom  to the wise, and knowledge to those possessing understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> He is revealing deep and hidden things; He hath known what  [is] in darkness, and light with Him hath dwelt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> Thee, O God of my fathers, I am thanking and praising, for  wisdom and might Thou hast given to me; and now, Thou hast  caused me to know that which we have sought from Thee, for the  king's matter Thou hast caused us to know.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Therefore Daniel hath gone up unto Arioch, whom the king  hath appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he hath  gone, and thus hath said to him, `The wise men of Babylon thou  dost not destroy, bring me up before the king, and the  interpretation to the king I do shew.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> Then Arioch in haste hath brought up Daniel before the  king, and thus hath said to him -- `I have found a man of the  sons of the Removed of Judah, who the interpretation to the  king doth make known.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> The king hath answered and said to Daniel, whose name [is]  Belteshazzar, `Art thou able to cause me to know the dream that  I have seen, and its interpretation?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> Daniel hath answered before the king and said, `The secret  that the king is asking, the wise men, the enchanters, the  scribes, the soothsayers, are not able to shew to the king;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> but there is a God in the heavens, a revealer of secrets,  and He hath made known to king Nebuchadnezzar that which [is]  to be in the latter end of the days. `Thy dream and the visions  of thy head on thy bed are these:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Thou, O king, thy thoughts on thy bed have come up  [concerning] that which [is] to be after this, and the Revealer  of secrets hath caused thee to know that which [is] to be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> As to me -- not for [any] wisdom that is in me above any  living hath this secret been revealed to me; but for the intent  that the interpretation to the king they make known, and the  thoughts of thy heart thou dost know.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> `Thou, O king, wast looking, and lo, a certain great image.  This image [is] mighty, and its brightness excellent; it is  standing over-against thee, and its appearance [is] terrible.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> This image! its head [is] of good gold, its breasts and its  arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron, and part  of them of clay.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> Thou wast looking till that a stone hath been cut out  without hands, and it hath smitten the image on its feet, that  [are] of iron and of clay, and it hath broken them small;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> then broken small together have been the iron, the clay,  the brass, the silver, and the gold, and they have been as  chaff from the summer threshing-floor, and carried them away  hath the wind, and no place hath been found for them: and the  stone that smote the image hath become a great mountain, and  hath filled all the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> This [is] the dream, and its interpretation we do tell  before the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> `Thou, O king, art a king of kings, for the God of the  heavens a kingdom, strength, and might, and glory, hath given  to thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:38">2:38</a> and whithersoever sons of men are dwelling, the beast of  the field, and the fowl of the heavens, He hath given into thy  hand, and hath caused thee to rule over them all; thou [art]  this head of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:39">2:39</a> And after thee doth rise up another kingdom lower than  those, and another third kingdom of brass, that doth rule  overall the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:40">2:40</a> And the fourth kingdom is strong as iron, because that iron  is breaking small, and making feeble, all [things], even as  iron that is breaking all these, it beateth small and breaketh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:41">2:41</a> As to that which thou hast seen: the feet and toes, part of  them potter's clay, and part of them iron, the kingdom is  divided: and some of the standing of the iron [is] to be in it,  because that thou hast seen the iron mixed with miry clay.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:42">2:42</a> As to the toes of the feet, part of them iron, and part of  them clay: some part of the kingdom is strong, and some part of  it is brittle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:43">2:43</a> Because thou hast seen iron mixed with miry clay, they are  mixing themselves with the seed of men: and they are not  adhering one with another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:44">2:44</a> `And in the days of these kings raise up doth the God of  the heavens a kingdom that is not destroyed -- to the age, and  its kingdom to another people is not left: it beateth small and  endeth all these kingdoms, and it standeth to the age.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:45">2:45</a> Because that thou hast seen that out of the mountain cut  hath been a stone without hands, and it hath beaten small the  iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great  God hath made known to the king that which [is] to be after  this; and the dream [is] true, and its interpretation stedfast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:46">2:46</a> Then hath king Nebuchadnezzar fallen on his face, and to  Daniel he hath done obeisance, and present, and sweet things,  he hath said to pour out to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:47">2:47</a> The king hath answered Daniel and said, `Of a truth [it is]  that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a  revealer of secrets, since thou hast been able to reveal this  secret.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:48">2:48</a> Then the king hath made Daniel great, and many great gifts  he hath given to him, and hath caused him to rule over all the  province of Babylon, and chief of the perfects over all the  wise men of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:49">2:49</a> And Daniel hath sought from the king, and he hath appointed  over the work of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach,  and Abed-Nego, and Daniel [is] in the gate of the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Nebuchadnezzar the king hath made an image of gold, its  height sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits; he hath raised it  up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babylon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and Nebuchadnezzar the king hath sent to gather the satraps,  the prefects, and the governors, the honourable judges, the  treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers  of the province, to come to the dedication of the image that  Nebuchadnezzar the king hath raised up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Then are gathered the satraps, the prefects, and the  governors, the honourable judges, the treasurers, the  counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the province,  to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king  hath raised up: and they are standing before the image that  Nebuchadnezzar hath raised up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And a crier is calling mightily: `To you they are saying: O  peoples, nations, and languages!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> at the time that ye hear the voice of the cornet, the flute,  the harp, the sackbut, the psaltery, the symphony, and all  kinds of music, ye fall down and do obeisance to the golden  image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath raised up:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and whoso doth not fall down and do obeisance, in that hour  he is cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Therefore at that time, when all the peoples are hearing the  voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut, the  psaltery, and all kinds of music, falling down are all the  peoples, nations and languages, doing obeisance to the golden  image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath raised up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Therefore at that time drawn near have certain Chaldeans,  and accused the Jews;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> they have answered, yea, they are saying to Nebuchadnezzar  the king, `O king, to the ages live!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Thou, O king, hast made a decree that every man who doth  hear the voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut,  the psaltery, and the symphony, and all kinds of music, doth  fall down and do obeisance to the golden image;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> and whoso doth not fall down and do obeisance, is cast into  the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the  work of the province of Babylon -- Shadrach, Meshach, and  Abed-Nego, these men have not made of thee, O king, [any]  regard; thy gods they are not serving, and to the golden image  thou hast raised up -- are not making obeisance.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Then Nebuchadnezzar, in anger and fury, hath said to bring  in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. Then these men have been  brought in before the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Nebuchadnezzar hath answered and said to them, `Is [it] a  laid plan, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego -- my gods ye are  not serving, and to the golden image that I have raised up ye  are not doing obeisance?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Now, lo, ye are ready, so that at the time that ye hear the  voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut, the  psaltery, and the symphony, and all kinds of music, ye fall  down and do obeisance to the image that I have made! -- and lo,  ye do no obeisance -- in that hour ye are cast into the midst  of a burning fiery furnace; who is that God who doth deliver  you out of my hands?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego have answered, yea, they  are saying to the king Nebuchadnezzar, `We have no need  concerning this matter to answer thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Lo, it is; our God whom we are serving, is able to deliver  us from a burning fiery furnace; and from thy hand, O king, He  doth deliver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And lo -- not! be it known to thee, O king, that thy gods  we are not serving, and to the golden image thou hast raised up  we do no obeisance.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Then Nebuchadnezzar hath been full of fury, and the  expression of his face hath been changed concerning Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abed-Nego; he answered and said to heat the  furnace seven times above that which it is seen to be heated;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> and to certain mighty men who [are] in his force he hath  said to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, to cast into the  burning fiery furnace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> Then these men have been bound in their coats, their  tunics, and their turbans, and their clothing, and have been  cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Therefore, because that the word of the king is urgent, and  the furnace heated exceedingly, those men who have taken up  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego -- killed them hath the spark  of the fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, have  fallen down in the midst of the burning fiery furnace -- bound.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king hath been astonished, and hath  risen in haste; he hath answered and said to his counsellors,  `Have we not cast three men into the midst of the fire --  bound?' They have answered and are saying to the king,  `Certainly, O king.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> He answered and hath said, `Lo, I am seeing four men loose,  walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and  the appearance of the fourth [is] like to a son of the gods.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> Then Nebuchadnezzar hath drawn near to the gate of the  burning fiery furnace; he hath answered and said, `Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of God Most High come forth,  yea, come;' then come forth do Shadrach, Meshach, and  Abed-Nego, from the midst of the fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> and gathered together, the satraps, the prefects, and the  governors, and the counsellors of the king, are seeing these  men, that the fire hath no power over their bodies, and the  hair of their head hath not been singed, and their coats have  not changed, and the smell of fire hath not passed on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> Nebuchadnezzar hath answered and hath said, `Blessed [is]  the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who hath sent His  messenger, and hath delivered His servants who trusted on Him,  and the word of the king changed, and gave up their bodies that  they might not serve nor do obeisance to any god except to  their own God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> And by me a decree is made, that any people, nation, and  language, that doth speak erroneously concerning the God of  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, pieces he is made, and its  house is made a dunghill, because that there is no other god  who is able thus to deliver.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> Then the king hath caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego,  to prosper in the province of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> `Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations, and  languages, who are dwelling in all the earth: Your peace be  great!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> The signs and wonders that God Most High hath done with me,  it is good before me to shew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> His signs how great! and His wonders how mighty! His kingdom  [is] a kingdom age-during, and His rule [is] with generation  and generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> `I, Nebuchadnezzar, have been at rest in my house, and  flourishing in my palace:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> a dream I have seen, and it maketh me afraid, and the  conceptions on my bed, and the visions of my head, do trouble  me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And by me a decree is made, to cause all the wise men of  Babylon to come up before me, that the interpretation of the  dream they may cause me to know.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Then coming up are the scribes, the enchanters, the  Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and the dream I have told  before them, and its interpretation they are not making known  to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And at last come up before me hath Daniel, whose name [is]  Belteshazzar -- according to the name of my god -- and in whom  [is] the spirit of the holy gods, and the dream before him I  have told:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> `O Belteshazzar, master of the scribes, as I have known that  the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee, and no secret doth  press thee, the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its  interpretation, tell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> As to the visions of my head on my bed, I was looking, and  lo, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height [is]  great:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> become great hath the tree, yea, strong, and its height  doth reach to the heavens, and its vision to the end of the  whole land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> its leaves [are] fair, and its budding great, and food for  all [is] in it: under it take shade doth the beast of the  field, and in its boughs dwell do the birds of the heavens, and  of it fed are all flesh.</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Then Daniel hath been caused to come up before the king;  answered hath the king, and said to Daniel, `Thou art that  Daniel who [art] of the sons of the Removed of Judah, whom the  king my father brought in out of Judah?</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Then hath Daniel answered and said before the king, `Thy  gifts be to thyself, and thy fee to another give; nevertheless,  the writing I do read to the king, and the interpretation I  cause him to know;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> thou, O king, God Most High, a kingdom, and greatness, and  glory, and honour, gave to Nebuchadnezzar thy father:</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> and when his heart was high, and his spirit was strong to  act proudly, he hath been caused to come down from the throne  of his kingdom, and his glory they have caused to pass away  from him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> and from the sons of men he is driven, and his heart with  the beasts hath been like, and with the wild asses [is] his  dwelling; the herb like oxen they cause him to eat, and by the  dew of the heavens is his body wet, till that he hath known  that God Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and whom He  willeth He raiseth up over it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Then hath Belshazzar said, and they have clothed Daniel  with purple, and a bracelet of gold [is] on his neck, and they  have proclaimed concerning him that he is the third ruler in  the kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans is slain,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> and Darius the Mede hath received the kingdom, when a son  of sixty and two years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> It hath been good before Darius, and he hath established  over the kingdom satraps -- a hundred and twenty -- that they  may be throughout the whole kingdom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> and higher than they three presidents, of whom Daniel [is]  first, that these satraps may give to them an account, and the  king have no loss.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Then this Daniel hath been overseer over the presidents and  satraps, because that an excellent spirit [is] in him, and the  king hath thought to establish him over the whole kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Then the presidents and satraps have been seeking to find a  cause of complaint against Daniel concerning the kingdom, and  any cause of complaint and corruption they are not able to  find, because that he [is] faithful, and any error and  corruption have not been found in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Then these men are saying, `We do not find against this  Daniel any cause of complaint, except we have found [it]  against him in the law of his God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Then these presidents and satraps have assembled near the  king, and thus they are saying to him: `O king Darius, to the  ages live!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> Taken counsel have all the presidents of the kingdom, the  prefects, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the governors,  to establish a royal statute, and to strengthen an interdict,  that any who seeketh a petition from any god and man until  thirty days, save of thee, O king, is cast into a den of lions.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Now, O king, thou dost establish the interdict, and sign the  writing, that it is not to be changed, as a law of Media and  Persia, that doth not pass away.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Therefore king Darius hath signed the writing and interdict.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And Daniel, when he hath known that the writing is signed,  hath gone up to his house, and the window being opened for him,  in his upper chamber, over-against Jerusalem, three times in a  day he is kneeling on his knees, and praying, and confessing  before his God, because that he was doing [it] before this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> Then these men have assembled, and found Daniel praying and  entreating grace before his God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> then they have come near, yea, they are saying before the  king concerning the king's interdict: `Hast thou not signed an  interdict, that any man who seeketh from any god and man until  thirty days, save of thee, O king, is cast into a den of  lions?' Answered hath the king, and said, `The thing [is]  certain as a law of Media and Persia, that doth not pass away.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> Then they have answered, yea, they are saying before the  king, that, `Daniel, who [is] of the sons of the Removed of  Judah, hath not placed on thee, O king, [any] regard, nor on  the interdict that thou hast signed, and three times in a day  he is seeking his petition.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> Then the king, when he hath heard the matter, is greatly  displeased at himself, and on Daniel he hath set the heart to  deliver him, and till the going up of the sun he was arranging  to deliver him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Then these men have assembled near the king, and are saying  to the king, `know, O king, that the law of Media and Persia  [is]: That any interdict and statute that the king doth  establish is not to be changed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> Then the king hath said, and they have brought Daniel, and  have cast [him] into a den of lions. The king hath answered and  said to Daniel, `Thy God, whom thou art serving continually,  Himself doth deliver thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And a stone hath been brought and placed at the mouth of  the den, and the king hath sealed it with his signet, and with  the signet of his great men, that the purpose be not changed  concerning Daniel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> Then hath the king gone to his palace, and he hath passed  the night fasting, and dahavan have not been brought up before  him, and his sleep hath fled [from] off him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> Then doth the king rise in the early morning, at the light,  and in haste to the den of lions he hath gone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> and at his coming near to the den, to Daniel, with a  grieved voice, he crieth. The king hath answered and said to  Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, thy God, whom thou  art serving continually, is He able to deliver thee from the  lions?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Then Daniel hath spoken with the king: `O king, to the ages  live:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> my God hath sent His messenger, and hath shut the lions'  mouths, and they have not injured me: because that before Him  purity hath been found in me; and also before thee, O king,  injury I have not done.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> Then was the king very glad for him, and he hath commanded  Daniel to be taken up out of the den, and Daniel hath been  taken up out of the den, and no injury hath been found in him,  because he hath believed in his God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And the king hath said, and they have brought those men who  had accused Daniel, and to the den of lions they have cast  them, they, their sons, and their wives; and they have not come  to the lower part of the den till that the lions have power  over them, and all their bones they have broken small.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> Then Darius the king hath written to all the peoples,  nations, and languages, who are dwelling in all the land: `Your  peace be great!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> From before me is made a decree, that in every dominion of  my kingdom they are trembling and fearing before the God of  Daniel, for He [is] the living God, and abiding to the ages,  and His kingdom that which [is] not destroyed, and His dominion  [is] unto the end.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> A deliverer, and rescuer, and doer of signs and wonders in  the heavens and in earth [is] He who hath delivered Daniel from  the paw of the lions.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> And this Daniel hath prospered in the reign of Darius, and  in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel hath  seen a dream, and the visions of his head on his bed, then the  dream he hath written, the chief of the things he hath said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Answered hath Daniel and said, `I was seeing in my vision by  night, and lo, the four winds of the heavens are coming forth  to the great sea;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> and four great beasts are coming up from the sea, diverse  one from another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> The first [is] like a lion, and it hath an eagle's wings. I  was seeing till that its wings have been plucked, and it hath  been lifted up from the earth, and on feet as a man it hath  been caused to stand, and a heart of man is given to it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And lo, another beast, a second, like to a bear, and to the  same authority it hath been raised, and three ribs [are] in its  mouth, between its teeth, and thus they are saying to it, Rise,  consume much flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> `After this I was seeing, and lo, another like a leopard,  and it hath four wings of a fowl on its back, and four heads  hath the beast, and dominion is given to it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> `After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and  lo, a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly  strong; and it hath iron teeth very great, it hath consumed,  yea, it doth break small, and the remnant with its feet it hath  trampled; and it [is] diverse from all the beasts that [are]  before it; and it hath ten horns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> `I was considering about the horns, and lo, another horn, a  little one, hath come up between them, and three of the first  horns have been eradicated from before it, and lo, eyes as the  eyes of man [are] in this horn, and a mouth speaking great  things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> `I was seeing till that thrones have been thrown down, and  the Ancient of Days is seated, His garment as snow [is] white,  and the hair of his head [is] as pure wool, His throne flames  of fire, its wheels burning fire.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> `I was seeing, then, because of the voice of the great  words that the horn is speaking, I was seeing till that the  beast is slain, and his body hath been destroyed, and given to  the burning fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> and the rest of the beasts have caused their dominion to  pass away, and a prolongation in life is given to them, till a  season and a time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> `I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, with the  clouds of the heavens as a son of man was [one] coming, and  unto the Ancient of Days he hath come, and before Him they have  brought him near.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> `Thus he said: The fourth beast is the fourth kingdom in  the earth, that is diverse from all kingdoms, and it consumeth  all the earth, and treadeth it down, and breaketh it small.</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:38">11:38</a> And to the god of strongholds, on his station, he giveth  honour; yea, to a god whom his fathers knew not he giveth  honour, with gold, and with silver, and with precious stone,  and with desirable things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:39">11:39</a> And he hath dealt in the fortresses of the strongholds  with a strange god whom he hath acknowledged; he multiplieth  honour, and hath caused them to rule over many, and the ground  he apportioneth at a price.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:40">11:40</a> `And at the time of the end, push himself forward with him  doth a king of the south, and storm against him doth a king of  the north, with chariot, and with horsemen, and with many  ships; and he hath come in to the lands, and hath overflowed,  and passed over,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:41">11:41</a> and hath come into the desirable land, and many do  stumble, and these escape from his hand: Edom, and Moab, and  the chief of the sons of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:42">11:42</a> `And he sendeth forth his hand upon the lands, and the  land of Egypt is not for an escape;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:43">11:43</a> and he hath ruled over treasures of gold and of silver,  and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and Lubim and  Cushim [are] at his steps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:44">11:44</a> `And reports trouble him out of the east and out of the  north, and he hath gone forth in great fury to destroy, and to  devote many to destruction;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:45">11:45</a> and he planteth the tents of his palace between the seas  and the holy desirable mountain, and hath come unto his end,  and there is no helper to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> `And at that time stand up doth Michael, the great head,  who is standing up for the sons of thy people, and there hath  been a time of distress, such as hath not been since there hath  been a nation till that time, and at that time do thy people  escape, every one who is found written in the book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> `And the multitude of those sleeping in the dust of the  ground do awake, some to life age-during, and some to  reproaches -- to abhorrence age-during.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And thou, O Daniel, hide the things, and seal the book till  the time of the end, many do go to and fro, and knowledge is  multiplied.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And I have looked -- I, Daniel -- and lo, two others are  standing, one here at the edge of the flood, and one there at  the edge of the flood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and he saith to the one clothed in linen, who [is] upon the  waters of the flood, `Till when [is] the end of these wonders?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And I hear the one clothed in linen, who [is] upon the  waters of the flood, and he doth lift up his right hand and his  left unto the heavens, and sweareth by Him who is living to the  age, that, `After a time, times, and a half, and at the  completion of the scattering of the power of the holy people,  finished are all these.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And I have heard, and I do not understand, and I say, `O my  lord, what [is] the latter end of these?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And he saith, `Go, Daniel; for hidden and sealed [are] the  things till the time of the end;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> Purify themselves, yea, make themselves white, yea,  refined are many: and the wicked have done wickedly, and none  of the wicked understand, and those acting wisely do  understand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> and from the time of the turning aside of the perpetual  [sacrifice], and to the giving out of the desolating  abomination, [are] days a thousand, two hundred, and ninety.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> O the blessedness of him who is waiting earnestly, and  doth come to the days, a thousand, three hundred, thirty and  five.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And thou, go on to the end, then thou dost rest, and dost  stand in thy lot at the end of the days.'</p>
