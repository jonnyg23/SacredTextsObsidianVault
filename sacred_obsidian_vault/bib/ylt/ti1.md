  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: 1 Timothy</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of  God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness,  peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I  going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not  to teach any other thing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that  cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in  faith: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and  of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain  discourse,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the  things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> and we have known that the law [is] good, if any one may use  it lawfully;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set,  but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and  sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides,  men-slayers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured  persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound  doctrine is adverse,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God,  with which I was entrusted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our  Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put [me] to the  ministration,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and  insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did  [it] in unbelief,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with  faith and love that [is] in Christ Jesus:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that  Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom  I am;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> but because of this I found kindness, that in me first  Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern  of those about to believe on him to life age-during:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible,  only wise God, [is] honour and glory -- to the ages of the  ages! Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to  the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war  in them the good warfare,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> having faith and a good conscience, which certain having  thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to  the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak  evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications,  prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and  peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> for this [is] right and acceptable before God our Saviour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full  knowledge of the truth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> for one [is] God, one also [is] mediator of God and of men,  the man Christ Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in  its own times --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth  I say in Christ, I do not lie -- a teacher of nations, in faith  and truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up  kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with  modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair,  or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> but -- which becometh women professing godly piety --  through good works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a  husband, but to be in quietness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> for Adam was first formed, then Eve,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been  deceived, into transgression came,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they  remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Stedfast [is] the word: If any one the oversight doth long  for, a right work he desireth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one  wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of  strangers, apt to teach,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre,  but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> his own house leading well, having children in subjection  with all gravity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> (and if any one his own house [how] to lead hath not known,  how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to  a judgment of the devil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those  without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the  devil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Ministrants -- in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not  given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and let these also first be proved, then let them minister,  being unblameable.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Women -- in like manner grave, not false accusers,  vigilant, faithful in all things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Ministrants -- let them be of one wife husbands; the  children leading well, and their own houses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> for those who did minister well a good step to themselves  do acquire, and much boldness in faith that [is] in Christ  Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee  soon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth  [thee] to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an  assembly of the living God -- a pillar and foundation of the  truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety -- God was  manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by  messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world,  taken up in glory!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times  shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to  seducing spirits and teachings of demons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own  conscience,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God  created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing  and acknowledging the truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> because every creature of God [is] good, and nothing [is] to  be rejected, with thanksgiving being received,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> for it is sanctified through the word of God and  intercession.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a  good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words  of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst  follow after,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and the profane and old women's fables reject thou, and  exercise thyself unto piety,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety  is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that  now is, and of that which is coming;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we  hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men --  especially of those believing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Charge these things, and teach;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of  those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in  faith, in purity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation,  to the teaching;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee  through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy  advancement may be manifest in all things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them,  for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those  hearing thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as  a father; younger persons as brethren;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all  purity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> honour widows who are really widows;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them  learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back  a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable  before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon  God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers  night and day,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> and she who is given to luxury, living -- hath died;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> and these things charge, that they may be blameless;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of  the household -- doth not provide, the faith he hath denied,  and than an unbeliever he is worse.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age,  having been a wife of one husband,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> in good works being testified to: if she brought up  children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she  washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good  work she followed after;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel  against the Christ, they wish to marry,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> having judgment, because the first faith they did cast  away,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> and at the same time also, they learn [to be] idle, going  about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and  busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children,  to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the  opposer to reviling;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let  them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that  those really widows it may relieve.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> The well-leading elders of double honour let them be  counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and  teaching,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> for the Writing saith, `An ox treading out thou shalt not  muzzle,' and `Worthy [is] the workman of his reward.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two  or three witnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may  have fear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and  the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep,  without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship  with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using,  because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading  before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> in like manner also the right works are manifest  beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be  hid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters  worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and  the teaching may not be evil spoken of;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> and those having believing masters, let them not slight  [them], because they are brethren, but rather let them serve,  because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are  partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to  sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the  teaching according to piety,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and  word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife,  evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of  the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> for nothing did we bring into the world -- [it is] manifest  that we are able to carry nothing out;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice  ourselves;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a  snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men  into ruin and destruction,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which  certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and  themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue  righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on  the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst  profess the right profession before many witnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive,  and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the  right profession,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the  manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and  only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> who only is having immortality, dwelling in light  unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to  see, to whom [is] honour and might age-during! Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be  high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in  the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for  enjoyment; --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to  impart, willing to communicate,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time  to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the  profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named  knowledge,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> which certain professing -- concerning the faith did  swerve; the grace [is] with you. Amen. </p>
