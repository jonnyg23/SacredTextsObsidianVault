  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Zephaniah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Zephaniah son of  Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezikiah, in the  days of Josiah son of Amoz, king of Judah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> I utterly consume all from off the face of the ground, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> I consume man and beast, I consume fowl of the heavens, and  fishes of the sea, And the stumbling-blocks -- the wicked, And  I have cut off man from the face of the ground, An affirmation  of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And stretched out My hand against Judah, And against all  inhabiting Jerusalem, And cut off from this place the remnant  of Baal, The name of the idolatrous priests, with the priests,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And those bowing themselves On the roofs to the host of the  heavens, And those bowing themselves, Swearing to Jehovah, and  swearing by Malcham,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And those removing from after Jehovah, And who have not  sought Jehovah, nor besought Him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Hush! because of the Lord Jehovah, For near [is] a day of  Jehovah, For prepared hath Jehovah a sacrifice, He hath  sanctified His invited ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And it hath come to pass, In the day of the sacrifice of  Jehovah, That I have laid a charge on the heads, And on sons of  the king, And on all putting on strange clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And I have laid a charge on every one Who is leaping over  the threshold in that day, Who are filling the house of their  masters [With] violence and deceit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And there hath been in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah,  The noise of a cry from the fish-gate, And of a howling from  the Second, And of great destruction from the hills.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Howl, ye inhabitants of the hollow place, For cut off hath  been all the merchant people, Cut off have been all bearing  silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And it hath come to pass, at that time, I search Jerusalem  with lights, And I have laid a charge on the men Who are  hardened on their preserved things, Who are saying in their  heart: Jehovah doth no good, nor doth He evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And their wealth hath been for a spoil, And their houses  for desolation, And they have built houses, and do not inhabit,  And they have planted vineyards, And they do not drink their  wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Near [is] the great day of Jehovah, Near, and hasting  exceedingly, The noise of the day of Jehovah, Bitterly shriek  there doth a mighty one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> A day of wrath [is] that day, A day of adversity and  distress, A day of waste and desolation, A day of darkness and  gloominess, A day of cloud and thick darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> A day of trumpet and shouting against the fenced cities,  And against the high corners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And I have sent distress to men, And they have walked as  the blind, For against Jehovah they have sinned, And poured out  is their blood as dust, And their flesh [is] as dung.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Even their silver, even their gold, Is not able to deliver  them in a day of the wrath of Jehovah, And in the fire of His  jealousy consumed is the whole land, For only a hastened end  doth He make Of all the inhabitants of the land!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Bend yourselves, yea, bend ye, O nation not desired,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> Before the bringing forth of a statute, As chaff hath the  day passed on, While yet not come in upon you doth the heat of  the anger of Jehovah, While yet not come in upon you doth a  day of the anger of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Seek Jehovah, all ye humble of the land, Who His judgment  have done, Seek ye righteousness, seek humility, It may be ye  are hidden in a day of the anger of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> For Gaza is forsaken, And Ashkelon [is] for a desolation,  Ashdod! at noon they do cast her forth, And Ekron is rooted up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Ho! O inhabitants of the sea-coast, Nation of the  Cherethites, A word of Jehovah [is] against you, Canaan, land  of the Philistines, And I have destroyed thee without an  inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And the sea-coast hath been habitations, Cottages [for]  shepherds, and folds [for] a flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And the coast hath been for the remnant of the house of  Judah, By them they have pleasure, In houses of Ashkelon at  even they lie down, For inspect them doth Jehovah their God,  And He hath turned back [to] their captivity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> I have heard the reproach of Moab, And the revilings of the  sons of Ammon, Wherewith they reproached My people, And magnify  [themselves] against their border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Therefore, I live, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, God  of Israel, Surely, Moab is as Sodom, And the sons of Ammon as  Gomorrah, An overrunning of nettles and salt-pits, And a  desolation -- unto the age. A residue of My people do seize  them, And a remnant of My nation inherit them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> This [is] to them for their arrogancy, Because they have  reproached, And they magnify [themselves] against the people of  Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Fearful [is] Jehovah against them, For He made bare all  gods of the land, And bow themselves to Him, each from his  place, Do all islanders of the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Also ye, O Cushim, pierced of My sword [are] they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And He stretcheth His hand against the north, And doth  destroy Asshur, And he setteth Nineveh for a desolation, A dry  land like a wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And crouched in her midst have droves, Every beast of the  nation, Both pelican and hedge-hog in her knobs lodge, A voice  doth sing at the window, `Destruction [is] at the threshold,  For the cedar-work is exposed.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> This [is] the exulting city that is dwelling confidently,  That is saying in her heart, `I [am], and beside me there is  none,' How hath she been for a desolation, A crouching-place  for beasts, Every one passing by her doth hiss, He doth shake  his hand!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Wo [to] the rebellious and polluted, The oppressing city!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> She hath not hearkened to the voice, She hath not accepted  instruction, In Jehovah she hath not trusted, Unto her God she  hath not drawn near.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Her heads in her midst [are] roaring lions, Her judges [are]  evening wolves, They have not gnawn the bone in the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Her prophets unstable -- men of treachery, Her priests have  polluted the sanctuary, They have violated the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Jehovah [is] righteous in her midst, He doth not do  perverseness, Morning by morning His judgment he giveth to the  light, It hath not been lacking, And the perverse doth not know  shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I have cut off nations, Desolated have been their chief  ones, I have laid waste their out-places without any passing  by, Destroyed have been their cities, Without man, without  inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> I have said: Only, ye do fear Me, Ye do accept instruction,  And her habitation is not cut off, All that I have appointed  for her, But they have risen early, They have corrupted all  their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Therefore, wait for Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah, For the  day of My rising for prey, For My judgment [is] to gather  nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them Mine  indignation, All the heat of Mine anger, For by the fire of My  jealousy consumed is all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> For then do I turn unto peoples a pure lip, To call all of  them by the name of Jehovah, To serve Him [with] one shoulder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> From beyond the rivers of Cush, my supplicants, The  daughter of My scattered ones, Do bring My present.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> In that day thou art not ashamed because of any of thine  actions, Wherewith thou hast transgressed against Me, For then  do I turn aside from thy midst The exulting ones of thine  excellency, And thou dost add no more to be haughty, In My holy  mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And I have left in thy midst a people humble and poor, And  they have trusted in the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The remnant of Israel do no perversity, nor speak lies, Nor  found in their mouth is a deceitful tongue, For they have  delight, and have lain down, And there is none troubling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Cry aloud, O daughter of Zion, shout, O Israel, Rejoice and  exult with the whole heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Jehovah hath turned aside thy judgments, He hath faced  thine enemy, The king of Israel, Jehovah, [is] in thy midst,  Thou seest evil no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> In that day it is said to Jerusalem, `Fear not, O Zion, let  not thy hands be feeble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Jehovah thy God [is] in thy midst, A mighty one doth save,  He rejoiceth over thee with joy, He doth work in His love, He  joyeth over thee with singing.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> Mine afflicted from the appointed place I have gathered,  from thee they have been, Bearing for her sake reproach.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Lo, I am dealing with all afflicting thee at that time, And  I have saved the halting one, And the driven out ones I do  gather, And have set them for a praise and for a name, In all  the land of their shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> At that time I bring you in, Even at the time of My  assembling you, For I give you for a name, and for a praise,  Among all peoples of the land, In My turning back [to] your  captivity before your eyes, said Jehovah! </p>
