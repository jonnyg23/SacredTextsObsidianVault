  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Haggai</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month,  on the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by the  prophet Haggai unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor  of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, The  time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be  built.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And the word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted  houses, while this house lieth waste?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but are not  satisfied; ye drink, but are not filled with drink; ye clothe  yourselves, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages  earneth wages for a bag with holes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Go up to the mountain and bring wood, and build the house,  and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Ye looked for much, and behold it was little; and when ye  brought it home, I blew upon it. Wherefore? saith Jehovah of  hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, whilst ye run  every man to his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Therefore over you the heavens withhold their dew, and the  earth withholdeth its fruit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the  mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon  the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and  upon man, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the  hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of  Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people,  hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of  Haggai the prophet, according as Jehovah their God had sent  him, and the people feared before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Then spoke Haggai, Jehovah's messenger, in Jehovah's  message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of  Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son  of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the  remnant of the people; and they came and worked at the house of  Jehovah of hosts, their God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the  second year of Darius the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> In the seventh [month], on the one and twentieth [day] of  the month, came the word of Jehovah by the prophet Haggai,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of  Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and  to the remnant of the people, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Who is left among you that saw this house in its former  glory? and how do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your  eyes?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> But now be strong, Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong,  Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye  people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you,  saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of  Egypt, and my Spirit, remain among you: fear ye not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little  while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the  sea, and the dry [land];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations  shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith  Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of  hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the  former, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this place will I give  peace, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> On the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in  the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai  the prophet, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests  [concerning] the law, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and  with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or  any food -- shall it become holy? And the priests answered and  said, No.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And Haggai said, If one that is unclean by a dead body  touch any of these, is it become unclean? And the priests  answered and said, It shall be unclean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is  this nation before me, saith Jehovah, and so is every work of  their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And now, I pray you, consider from this day and onward,  from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of  Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> -- before those [days] were, when one came to a heap of  twenty [measures], there were but ten; when one came to the vat  to draw out fifty press-measures, there were but twenty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in  all the work of your hands; and ye [turned] not to me, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Consider, I pray you, from this day and onward, from the  four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], from the day that  the foundation of Jehovah's temple was laid, consider [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the  fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not  brought forth: from this day will I bless [you].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai on  the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will  shake the heavens and the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will  destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will  overthrow the chariots, and those that ride therein; and the  horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword  of his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee,  Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, and  will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith  Jehovah of hosts.</p>
