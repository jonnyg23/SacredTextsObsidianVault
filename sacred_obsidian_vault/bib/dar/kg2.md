  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 2 Kings</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper  chamber which was in Samaria, and was sick; and he sent  messengers and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god  of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,  go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to  them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to  inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Now therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not come down  from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly  die. And Elijah departed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And the messengers returned to him; and he said to them, Why  have ye returned?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And they said unto him, A man came up to meet us, and said  to us, Go, return to the king that sent you and say to him,  Thus saith Jehovah: Is it because there is not a God in Israel,  that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?  therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou  art gone up, but shalt certainly die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And he said to them, What manner of man was he that came up  to meet you, and told you these words?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And they said to him, He was a man in a hairy [garment], and  girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It  is Elijah the Tishbite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he  went up to him, and behold, he sat on the top of the mount. And  he spoke to him: Man of God, the king says, Come down!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, And  if I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and  consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from the  heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his  fifty. And he spoke and said to him, Man of God, thus says the  king: Come down quickly!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God,  let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy  fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens, and  consumed him and his fifty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his  fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and  fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him and said to  him, Man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of  these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Behold, there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed  the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties; but  now, let my life be precious in thy sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him:  be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to  the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Forasmuch as thou  hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron,  is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?  therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou  art gone up, but shalt certainly die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And he died according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah  had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead, in the  second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah;  for he had no son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, what he did, are they  not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of  Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And it came to pass when Jehovah would take up Elijah into  the heavens by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from  Gilgal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And Elijah said to Elisha, Abide here, I pray thee; for  Jehovah has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said, As Jehovah  liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they  went down to Bethel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth  to Elisha, and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will  take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I  also know it: be silent!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And Elijah said to him, Elisha, abide here, I pray thee; for  Jehovah has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth,  and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they came to  Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho drew near  to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will  take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I  also know it: be silent!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And Elijah said to him, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah  has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and  as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they two went  on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood  opposite afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and  smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and  they two went over on dry ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And it came to pass when they had gone over, that Elijah  said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken  away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double  portion of thy spirit be upon me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me  when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not,  it shall not be [so].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And it came to pass as they went on, and talked, that  behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire; and they parted  them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the  heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Elisha saw [it], and he cried, My father, my father!  the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him  no more. Then he took hold of his own garments and rent them in  two pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him,  and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and he took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him,  and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of  Elijah? He also smote the waters, and they parted hither and  thither, and Elisha went over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho on the  opposite side saw him, and they said, The spirit of Elijah  rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed  themselves to the ground before him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants  fifty valiant men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy  master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah have taken him up,  and cast him upon some mountain, or into some ravine. And he  said, Ye shall not send.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And they pressed him till he was ashamed, and he said,  Send. They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought three  days, but did not find him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And they came again to him (now he was staying at Jericho);  and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold now, the  situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water  is bad, and the land is barren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And  they brought it to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And he went forth to the source of the waters, and cast the  salt in there, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed  these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or  barrenness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And the waters were healed to this day, according to the  saying of Elisha which he spoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And he went up from thence to Bethel, and as he went up by  the way, there came forth little boys out of the city, and  mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald head; go up, bald  head!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in  the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of  the wood, and tore forty-two children of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he  returned to Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in  Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah;  and he reigned twelve years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And he wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like  his father, and like his mother; and he took away the column of  Baal that his father had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Only, he clave to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who  made Israel to sin: he did not depart therefrom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered to  the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred  thousand rams, with the wool.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And it came to pass when Ahab was dead, that the king of  Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And at that time king Jehoram went out of Samaria and  inspected all Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah  saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: wilt thou go  with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am  as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he said, By way  of the wilderness of Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the  king of Edom, and they made a circuit of seven days' journey.  And there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that  followed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And the king of Israel said, Alas! that Jehovah has called  these three kings together, to give them into the hand of Moab!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of  Jehovah that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the  king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the  son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. And  the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went  down to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do  with thee? go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets  of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Not so, for  Jehovah has called these three kings to give them into the hand  of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I  stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of  Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee nor  see thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And now fetch me a minstrel. And it came to pass when the  minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah was upon him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And he said, Thus saith Jehovah: Make this valley full of  ditches.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Ye shall not see wind, neither  shall ye see rain; yet this valley shall be filled with water,  and ye shall drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And this is a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will  give the Moabites also into your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice  city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of  water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And it came to pass in the morning, when the oblation was  offered up, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom,  and the country was filled with water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to  fight against them, and they were called together, all that  were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood by the  border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun rose  upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other  side red as blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And they said, This is blood: the kings are entirely  destroyed, and have smitten one another; and now, Moab, to the  spoil!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites  rose up and smote the Moabites, and they fled before them; and  they entered in and smote Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of  land cast every man his stone and filled it, and they stopped  every well of water, and felled every good tree, until they  left [only] the stones at Kirhareseth; and the slingers went  about it, and smote it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for  him, and he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords,  to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> And he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his  stead, and offered him up for a burnt-offering upon the wall.  And there was great wrath against Israel; and they departed  from him, and returned to [their own] land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And a woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried  to Elisha saying, Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou  knowest that thy servant feared Jehovah; and the creditor is  come to take my two children to be bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me,  what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has not  anything at all in the house but a pot of oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And he said, Go, borrow for thyself vessels abroad from all  thy neighbours, empty vessels; let it not be few;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> and go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons,  and pour out into all those vessels, and set aside what is  full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon  her sons: they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured  out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And it came to pass when the vessels were full, that she  said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her,  There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And she came and told the man of God; and he said, Go, sell  the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou [and] thy sons on the  rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And it came to pass on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem,  where was a wealthy woman; and she constrained him to eat  bread. And so it was, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned  in thither to eat bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that  this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Let us make, I pray thee, a small upper chamber with walls,  and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat,  and a lampstand; and it shall be when he cometh to us, he shall  turn in thither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And it came to pass on a day, that he came thither, and he  turned into the upper chamber, and lay there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite.  And he called her, and she stood before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been  careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?  wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of  the host? And she said, I dwell among mine own people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi  said, Verily, she has no son, and her husband is old.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And he said, Call her; and he called her; and she stood in  the doorway.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And he said, At this appointed time, when thy term is come,  thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, man of  God, do not lie to thy handmaid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that appointed  time in the next year as Elisha had said to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And the child grew, and it came to pass one day, that he  went out to his father to the reapers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And he said to his father, My head, my head! And he said to  the servant, Carry him to his mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And he carried him, and brought him to his mother; and he  sat on her knees till noon, and died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,  and shut [the door] upon him, and went out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray  thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will  run to the man of God, and come again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? It is neither  new moon nor sabbath. And she said, [It is] well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> Then she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Drive  and go forward; slack not the riding for me, except I bid thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> And she went and came to the man of God, to mount Carmel.  And it came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off, that  he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, there is the Shunammite:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it  well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with  the child? And she said, It is well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> And she came to the man of God to the mountain, and caught  him by the feet; and Gehazi drew near to thrust her away; but  the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is troubled  within her, and Jehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told  me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> And she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,  Do not deceive me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff  in thy hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, salute him  not, and if any salute thee, answer him not again; and lay my  staff upon the face of the lad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> And the mother of the lad said, As Jehovah liveth, and as  thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And he rose up and  followed her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon  the face of the lad; but there was neither voice, nor sign of  attention. And he returned to meet him, and told him saying,  The lad is not awaked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the child was  dead, [and] laid upon his bed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> And he went in and shut the door upon them both, and prayed  to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth  upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon  his hands, and bent over him; and the flesh of the child grew  warm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> And he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and  went up, and bent over him. And the lad sneezed seven times,  and the lad opened his eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. And  he called her; and she came to him. And he said, Take up thy  son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:37">4:37</a> And she came and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the  ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:38">4:38</a> And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a famine in  the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him.  And he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil  pottage for the sons of the prophets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:39">4:39</a> Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found  a wild vine, and gathered from it his lap full of wild  colocynths, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage;  for they did not know them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:40">4:40</a> And they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to  pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out  and said, Man of God, there is death in the pot! And they could  not eat [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:41">4:41</a> And he said, Then bring meal. And he cast [it] into the  pot, and said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And  there was no harm in the pot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:42">4:42</a> And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the  man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley,  and fresh ears of corn in his sack. And he said, Give to the  people that they may eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:43">4:43</a> And his attendant said, How shall I set this before a  hundred men? And he said, Give the people that they may eat;  for thus saith Jehovah: They shall eat, and shall have to  spare.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:44">4:44</a> And he set [it] before them, and they ate and left  [thereof], according to the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a  great man before his master, and honourable, for by him Jehovah  had given deliverance to Syria; and he was a mighty man of  valour, [but] a leper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away  captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited  on Naaman's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And she said to her mistress, Oh, would that my lord were  before the prophet that is in Samaria! then he would cure him  of his leprosy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And he went and told his lord saying, Thus and thus said the  maid that is of the land of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And the king of Syria said, Well! go, and I will send a  letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with  him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [shekels] of gold,  and ten changes of raiment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And  now, when this letter comes to thee, behold, I have sent Naaman  my servant to thee, that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the  letter, that he rent his garments, and said, Am I God, to kill  and to make alive, that this man sends to me to cure a man of  his leprosy? Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he  seeks an occasion against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the  king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king,  saying, Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come now to  me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and  stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in  the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,  and thou shalt be clean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And Naaman was wroth, and went away and said, Behold, I  thought, He will certainly come out to me, and stand, and call  on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the  place, and cure the leper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,  better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them  and be clean? And he turned and went away in a rage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And his servants drew near, and spoke to him and said, My  father, [if] the prophet had bidden thee [do some] great thing,  wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he  says to thee, Wash and be clean?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Then he went down, and plunged himself seven times in the  Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his  flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was  clean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company,  and came and stood before him; and he said, Behold, I know that  there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; and now, I pray  thee, take a present of thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will  receive none! And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And Naaman said, If not, then let there, I pray thee, be  given to thy servant two mules' burden of [this] earth; for thy  servant will no more offer burnt-offering and sacrifice to  other gods, but to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master  goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, and he leans  on my hand, and I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon --  when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon  thy servant, I pray thee, in this thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And he said to him, Go in peace. And he departed from him a  little way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,  Behold, my master has spared Naaman, this Syrian, in not  receiving at his hands that which he brought; but as Jehovah  liveth, I will run after him and take somewhat of him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him  running after him, he sprang down from the chariot to meet him,  and said, Is all well?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And he said, All is well. My master has sent me saying,  Behold, even now there are come to me from mount Ephraim two  young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee,  a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> And Naaman said, Consent to take two talents. And he urged  him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two  changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his young men;  and they bore them before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand,  and stowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they  departed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And he entered in and stood before his master. And Elisha  said to him, Whence [comest thou], Gehazi? And he said, Thy  servant went no whither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> And he said to him, Did not my heart go, when the man  turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to  receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and  vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and bondmen, and bondwomen?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> But the leprosy of Naaman shall fasten upon thee, and upon  thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous,  as snow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the  place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Let us go, we pray thee, to the Jordan, and take thence  every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we  may dwell. And he said, Go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And one said, Consent, I pray thee, to go with thy servants.  And he said, I will go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And he went with them. And they came to the Jordan and cut  down the trees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And it came to pass as one was felling a beam, that the iron  fell into the water; and he cried and said, Alas, master, and  it was borrowed!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he shewed  him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither,  and made the iron to swim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And he said, Take [it] up to thee. And he put out his hand  and took it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And the king of Syria warred against Israel; and he took  counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place  [shall be] my camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying,  Beware that thou pass not such a place, for thither the Syrians  are come down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of  God told him and warned him of, and he was on his guard there.  [That took place] not once, nor twice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And the heart of the king of Syria was troubled because of  this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will  ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king; but  Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel  the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And he said, Go and see where he is, and I will send and  fetch him. And it was told him saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And he sent thither horses and chariots, and a great host,  and they came by night and surrounded the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And when the attendant of the man of God rose early and  went forth, behold, an army surrounded the city, with horses  and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how  shall we do?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And he said, Fear not, for they that are with us are more  than they that are with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> And Elisha prayed and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his  eyes that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young  man, and he saw; and, behold, the mountain was full of horses  and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> And they came down to him; and Elisha prayed to Jehovah and  said, Smite this nation, I pray thee, with blindness. And he  smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is  this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom  ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that  Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these [men] that they  may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw, and  behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My  father, shall I smite? shall I smite [them]?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> And he said, Thou shalt not smite [them]: wouldest thou  smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and  with thy bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may  eat and drink, and go to their master.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And he prepared a great repast for them, and they ate and  drank; and he sent them away, and they went to their master.  And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And it came to pass after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria  gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> And there was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they  besieged it, until an ass's head was worth eighty  silver-pieces, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung five  silver-pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> And it came to pass as the king of Israel was passing by  upon the wall, there cried a woman to him saying, Help, my lord  O king!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence should I  help thee? Out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she said,  This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him  to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> And we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the  next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she has hidden  her son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the  woman, that he rent his garments; and he was passing by upon  the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth  within upon his flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:31">6:31</a> And he said, God do so, and more also to me, if the head of  Elisha the son of Shaphat shall remain on him this day!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:32">6:32</a> And Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him.  And [the king] sent a man before him. Before the messenger came  to him, he himself said to the elders, Do ye see how this son  of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, when the  messenger comes; shut the door, and keep him off with the door:  is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:33">6:33</a> And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger  came down to him. And [the king] said, Behold, this evil is of  Jehovah: why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And Elisha said, Hear the word of Jehovah. Thus saith  Jehovah: To-morrow about this time shall the measure of fine  flour be at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel,  in the gate of Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the  man of God and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in  the heavens, would this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou  shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate,  and they said one to another, Why do we abide here until we  die?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> If we say, Let us enter into the city, the famine is in the  city, and we shall die there; and if we abide here, we shall  die. And now come, let us fall away to the camp of the Syrians:  if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they put us to  death, we shall but die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And they rose up in the dusk to go to the camp of the  Syrians; and they came to the extremity of the camp of the  Syrians; and behold, there was no man there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a  noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, a noise of a great  host; and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel  has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings  of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And they rose up and fled in the dusk, and left their tents,  and their horses, and their asses, the camp as it was, and fled  for their life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And those lepers came to the extremity of the camp; and they  went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried thence  silver and gold, and garments, and went and hid it; and they  came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence,  and went and hid [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And they said one to another, We are not doing right; this  day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we  tarry till the morning light, the iniquity will find us out;  and now come, let us go and tell the king's household.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And they came and called to the porters of the city, and  told them saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and  behold, there was no one there, no sound of man, but the horses  tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And the porters cried [it] and told [it] to the king's  house within.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And the king rose up in the night and said to his servants,  Let me tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know  that we are hungry, and they have gone out of the camp to hide  themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the  city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And one of his servants answered and said, Let some one  take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are  left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of  Israel that are left in it: behold, they are even as all the  multitude of the Israelites that have perished), and let us  send and see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And they took two chariots with their horses; and the king  sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And they went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the  way was full of garments and materials, which the Syrians had  cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told  the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And the people went out and plundered the camp of the  Syrians; and the measure of fine flour was at a shekel, and two  measures of barley at a shekel, according to the word of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> And the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he  leaned to have the charge of the gate; and the people trampled  upon him in the gate, and he died, according to what the man of  God had said, -- what he had said when the king came down to  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the  king saying, Two measures of barley shall be at a shekel, and  the measure of fine flour at a shekel, to-morrow about this  time in the gate of Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And the captain answered the man of God and said, Behold,  if Jehovah should make windows in the heavens, would such a  thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine  eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And so it happened to him; and the people trampled upon him  in the gate, and he died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored  to life, saying, Rise up and go, thou and thy household, and  sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn; for Jehovah has called  for a famine, and it shall also come upon the land for seven  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And the woman rose up, and did according to the saying of  the man of God, and went, she and her household, and sojourned  in the land of the Philistines seven years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman  returned out of the land of the Philistines; and she went forth  to cry to the king for her house and for her land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man  of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that  Elisha has done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had  restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman whose son  he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for  her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman,  and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And the king asked the woman, and she told him. And the king  appointed a certain chamberlain, saying, Restore all that was  hers, and all the revenue of the land since the day that she  left the country even until now.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria  was sick; and it was told him saying, The man of God is come  hither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and  go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying,  Shall I recover from this disease?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Hazael went to meet him, and took with him a present,  even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden; and  he came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-Hadad king  of Syria has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover from this  disease?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou wilt certainly  recover. But Jehovah has shewn me that he shall certainly die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was  ashamed; and the man of God wept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And Hazael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said,  Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of  Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their  young men wilt thou kill with the sword, and wilt dash in  pieces their children, and rip up their women with child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he  should do this great thing? And Elisha said, Jehovah has shewn  me that thou wilt be king over Syria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who  said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he said, He told  me [that] thou wouldest certainly recover.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And it came to pass the next day, that he took the coverlet  and dipped [it] in water, and spread it over his face, so that  he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of  Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son  of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the  house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he  did evil in the sight of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> But Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his  servant's sake, as he had promised him to give him always a  lamp for his sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and  they set a king over themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him;  and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites who had  surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the  people fled into their tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> But the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto  this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of  Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his  fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in  his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of  Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to  reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was  Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil  in the sight of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for he was the  son-in-law of the house of Ahab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against  Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead; and the Syrians  wounded Joram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And king Joram returned to be healed in Jizreel of the  wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought  with Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king  of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab at Jizreel,  for he was sick.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the  prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this  vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And when thou art come thither, look out there Jehu the son  of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him rise up  from among his brethren, and bring him to an inner chamber;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head and say,  Thus saith Jehovah: I have anointed thee king over Israel; and  open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth-Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were  sitting. And he said, I have an errand to thee, captain. And  Jehu said, To which of all of us? And he said, To thee,  captain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And he rose up and went into the house; and he poured the  oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of  Israel: I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah,  over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master; and I  will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the  blood of all the servants of Jehovah at the hand of Jezebel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off  from Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and left in  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And I will make the house of Ahab as the house of Jeroboam  the son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the plot of Jizreel, and  none shall bury her. And he opened the door and fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord. And one  said to him, Is all well? why came this madman to thee? And he  said to them, Ye know the man, and his mind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And they said, It is false! tell us now. And he said, Thus  and thus spoke he to me saying, Thus saith Jehovah: I have  anointed thee king over Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Then they hasted and took every man his garment, and put it  under him on the very stairs, and blew with trumpets, and said,  Jehu is king!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspired  against Joram. (Now Joram kept Ramoth-Gilead, he and all  Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> and king Joram had returned to be healed in Jizreel of the  wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought against  Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your will, let  not a fugitive escape out of the city to go to tell [it] in  Jizreel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jizreel; for Joram  lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see  Joram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And the watchman stood on the tower in Jizreel, and saw  Jehu's company as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram  said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say,  Is it peace?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> So there went one on horseback to meet him; and he said,  Thus saith the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou  to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told  saying, The messenger came to them, and he does not return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> And he sent out a second on horseback; and he came to them  and said, Thus saith the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What  hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And the watchman told saying, He came to them, and does not  return. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of  Nimshi; for he drives furiously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> Then Joram said, Make ready! And they made ready his  chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah  went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu,  and met him in the plot of Naboth the Jizreelite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is  it peace, Jehu? And he said, What peace, so long as the  fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her sorceries are so  many?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Then Joram turned his hand, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,  Treachery, Ahaziah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And Jehu took his bow in his hand, and smote Jehoram  between his arms, and the arrow went out through his heart; and  he sank down in his chariot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And he said to Bidkar his captain, Take him up [and] cast  him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jizreelite. For  remember how, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his  father, that Jehovah laid this burden upon him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Certainly I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and  the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee  in this plot, saith Jehovah. And now, take [and] cast him into  the plot, according to the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> When Ahaziah king of Judah saw [that], he fled by the way  of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said,  Smite him also in his chariot. It was on the ascent of Gur,  which is by Jibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and  buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of  David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> (And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab had  Ahaziah begun to reign over Judah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> And Jehu came to Jizreel; and Jezebel heard of it, and she  put paint to her eyes, and decked her head, and looked out at  the window.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> And when Jehu came in at the gate, she said, Is it peace,  Zimri, murderer of his master?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is  on my side? who? And two or three chamberlains looked out to  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> And he said, Throw her down! And they threw her down; and  some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses;  and he trampled on her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> And he came in, and ate and drank; and he said, Go, look, I  pray you, after this cursed [woman], and bury her; for she is a  king's daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her  than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of the hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:36">9:36</a> And they came back and told him. And he said, This is the  word of Jehovah, which he spoke through his servant Elijah the  Tishbite saying, In the plot of Jizreel shall dogs eat the  flesh of Jezebel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:37">9:37</a> and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the open  field in the plot of Jizreel, so that they shall not say, This  is Jezebel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote  letters, and sent to Samaria, to the princes of Jizreel, to the  elders, and to Ahab's guardians, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And now, when this letter comes to you, seeing your  master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots,  and horses, and a fortified city, and armour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> look out the best and worthiest of your master's sons, and  set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two  kings stood not before him; and how shall we stand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And he that was over the house, and he that was over the  city, and the elders, and the guardians sent to Jehu, saying,  We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we  will not make any one king; do what is good in thy sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And he wrote a letter the second time to them saying, If ye  are mine, and will hearken to my voice, take the heads of the  men your master's sons, and come to me to Jizreel to-morrow at  this time. Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the  great men of the city, who brought them up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And it came to pass when the letter came to them, that they  took the king's sons, and slaughtered seventy persons, and put  their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jizreel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And a messenger came and told him saying, They have brought  the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them in two  heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And it came to pass in the morning that he went out; and he  stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous! behold, I  conspired against my master and killed him; but who smote all  these?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word  of Jehovah, which Jehovah spoke concerning the house of Ahab;  for Jehovah has done that which he said through his servant  Elijah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in  Jizreel, and all his great men, and his acquaintances, and his  priests, until he left him none remaining.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And he rose up and departed, and came to Samaria. And as  he was at the shepherds' meeting-place on the way,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Jehu found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and  said, Who are ye? And they said, We are the brethren of  Ahaziah; and have come down to salute the children of the king,  and the children of the queen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And he said, Take them alive! And they took them alive,  and slew them at the well of the meeting-place, forty-two men;  and he left not one of them remaining.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And he departed thence, and found Jehonadab the son of  Rechab [coming] to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to  him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And  Jehonadab said, It is. -- If it be, give [me] thy hand. -- And  he gave [him] his hand; and [Jehu] took him up to him into the  chariot,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> and said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So  they made him ride in his chariot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And he came to Samaria, and smote all that remained to  Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the  word of Jehovah which he spoke to Elijah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to  them, Ahab served Baal a little: Jehu will serve him much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And now call me all the prophets of Baal, all his  servants, and all his priests: let none be wanting; for I have  a great sacrifice [to do] to Baal; whoever shall be wanting  shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, in order that he  might bring destruction upon the servants of Baal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> And Jehu said, Hallow a solemn assembly for Baal. And they  proclaimed [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> And Jehu sent into all Israel; and all the servants of  Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not: and  they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was  full from one end to the other.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And he said to him that was over the wardrobe, Bring forth  vestments for all the servants of Baal. And he brought them  forth vestments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> And Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab entered into the  house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and  see that there be here with you none of the servants of  Jehovah, but the servants of Baal only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And they entered in to offer sacrifices and  burnt-offerings. Now Jehu appointed eighty men without, and  said, He that allows any of the men to escape that I have  brought into your hands, his life shall be for the life of him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And it came to pass as soon as they had ended offering up  the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the couriers and to the  captains, Go in, slay them; let none come forth. And they smote  them with the edge of the sword; and the couriers and the  captains cast [them] there. And they went to the city of the  house of Baal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> and brought forth the columns out of the house of Baal,  and burned them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> and they broke down the column of Baal, and broke down the  house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> Thus Jehu extirpated Baal out of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> Only, the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made  Israel to sin, from them Jehu departed not: [from] the golden  calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because thou hast executed well  that which is right in my sight, [and] hast done unto the house  of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy children of  the fourth [generation] shall sit on the throne of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah the  God of Israel with all his heart; he departed not from the sins  of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> In those days Jehovah began to cut Israel short; and  Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the  Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer,  which is by the river Arnon, both Gilead and Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> And the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and  all his might, are they not written in the book of the  chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in  Samaria: and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> Now the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was  twenty-eight years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son  was dead, she rose up and destroyed all the royal seed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, the sister of  Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among  the king's sons that were slain, [and hid] him and his nurse in  the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was  not slain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years.  And Athaliah reigned over the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the  captains of the hundreds, of the bodyguard and the couriers,  and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah, and made a  covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of  Jehovah, and shewed them the king's son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And he commanded them saying, This is the thing which ye  shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath,  shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third  part at the gate behind the couriers; and ye shall keep the  watch of the house for a defence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And the two parts of you, all those that go forth on the  sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah  about the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And ye shall encompass the king round about, every man with  his weapons in his hand; and he that comes within the ranks  shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when he  goes out and when he comes in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And the captains of the hundreds did according to all that  Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men,  those that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were  to go forth on the sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the  priest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And the priest gave to the captains of the hundreds king  David's spears and shields which were in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And the couriers stood by the king round about, every man  with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house  to the left side of the house, toward the altar and the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown  upon him, and [gave him] the testimony; and they made him king,  and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long  live the king!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And Athaliah heard the noise of the couriers [and] of the  people; and she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And she looked, and behold, the king stood on the dais,  according to the custom, and the princes and the trumpeters  were by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and  blew with trumpets. And Athaliah rent her garments and cried,  Conspiracy! Conspiracy!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the  hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Lead  her forth without the ranks; and whosoever follows her, slay  with the sword; for the priest said, Let her not be put to  death in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And they made way for her, and she went by the way by  which the horses entered the king's house, and there was she  put to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king  and the people, that they should be the people of Jehovah; and  between the king and the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> Then all the people of the land went into the house of  Baal, and broke it down: his altars and his images they broke  in pieces completely, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before  the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the  bodyguard, and the couriers, and all the people of the land;  and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and  came by the way through the gate of the couriers into the  king's house. And he sat upon the throne of the kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was  quiet; and they had slain Athaliah with the sword [beside] the  king's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; and he  reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was  Zibiah of Beer-sheba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> And Jehoash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, all  the days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Only, the high places were not removed: the people still  sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the  hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, the  money of every one that passes [the account], the money at  which every man is valued, [and] all the money that comes into  any man's heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> let the priests take it, every man of his acquaintance; and  let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach  is found.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And it was [so that] in the twenty-third year of king  Jehoash, the priests had not repaired the breaches of the  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the  priests, and said to them, Why have ye not repaired the  breaches of the house? And now receive no money of your  acquaintances, but give it for the breaches of the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And the priests consented to receive no money of the  people, and that they should only repair the breaches of the  house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in  the lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one  comes into the house of Jehovah; and the priests that kept the  door put into it all the money brought into the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And it came to pass when they saw that there was much  money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest  came up, and they tied up and counted the money that was found  in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And they gave the money, weighed out into the hands of  them that did the work, who were appointed over the house of  Jehovah; and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders  that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> and to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and  hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and  for all that had to be laid out on the house for repairs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> However there were not made for the house of Jehovah  basons of silver, knives, bowls, trumpets, nor any utensil of  gold or utensil of silver, of the money that was brought [into]  the house of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> but they gave that to the workmen, and repaired the house  of Jehovah with it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they  gave the money to be bestowed on workmen; for they dealt  faithfully.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> The money of trespass-offerings, and the money of  sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it  was for the priests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against  Gath, and took it. And Hazael set his face to go up against  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things  that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of  Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the  gold found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah and in the  king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria; and he went  away from Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,  are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings  of Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy, and smote  Joash in the house of Millo, at the descent of Silla.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> And Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of  Shomer, his servants, smote him and he died; and they buried  him with his fathers in the city of David. And Amaziah his son  reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> In the three-and-twentieth year of Joash the son of  Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign  over Israel in Samaria, for seventeen years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the  sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he  departed not from them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he  delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into  the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael, all those days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> (And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened to  him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of  Syria oppressed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out  from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel  dwelt in their tents as before.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house  of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin: they walked therein; and  there remained also the Asherah in Samaria.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> For he had left of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty  horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the  king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the  dust by threshing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did,  and his might, are they not written in the book of the  chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in  Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his stead.</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And the covered way of the sabbath that they had built in  the house, and the king's entry outside, he turned from the  house of Jehovah on account of the king of Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And the rest of the acts of Ahaz, what he did, are they  not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of  Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his  fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiah his son reigned in  his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son  of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, for nine years.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria, and Hoshea  became his servant, and tendered him presents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he  had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and sent up no present  to the king of Assyria as [he had done] from year to year. And  the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And the king of Assyria overran the whole land, and went up  against Samaria, and besieged it three years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took  Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them  in Halah and by the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the  cities of the Medes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And so it was, because the children of Israel had sinned  against Jehovah their God, who had brought them up out of the  land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and  had feared other gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> and they walked in the statutes of the nations that Jehovah  had dispossessed from before the children of Israel, and of the  kings of Israel, which they had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And the children of Israel did secretly against Jehovah  their God things that were not right; and they built them high  places in all their cities, from the watchmen's tower to the  fortified city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And they set them up columns and Asherahs on every high  hill and under every green tree;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> and there they burned incense on all the high places, as  did the nations that Jehovah had carried away from before them,  and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> and they served idols, as to which Jehovah had said to  them, Ye shall not do this thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And Jehovah testified against Israel and against Judah, by  all the prophets, all the seers, saying, Turn from your evil  ways, and keep my commandments, my statutes, according to all  the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you  through my servants the prophets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> But they would not hear, and hardened their necks, like to  the neck of their fathers, who did not believe in Jehovah their  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant which he  had made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he had  testified unto them; and they followed vanity and became vain,  and [went] after the nations that were round about them,  concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not  do like them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their  God, and made them molten images, two calves, and made an  Asherah, and worshipped all the host of the heavens, and served  Baal;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass  through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and  sold themselves to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke  him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed  them out of his sight: there remained but the tribe of Judah  only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God,  but walked in the statutes of Israel which they had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel; and afflicted  them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he  had cast them out of his sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> For Israel had rent [the kingdom] from the house of David;  and they had made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam  violently turned Israel from following Jehovah, and made them  sin a great sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of  Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> until Jehovah had removed Israel out of his sight, as he  had said through all his servants the prophets; and Israel was  carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylon, and  from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from  Sepharvaim, and made them dwell in the cities of Samaria  instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria,  and dwelt in its cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there,  that they feared not Jehovah; and Jehovah sent lions among  them, which killed [some] of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> And they spoke to the king of Assyria saying, The nations  that thou hast removed and made to dwell in the cities of  Samaria know not the manner of the god of the land; therefore  he has sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them,  because they know not the manner of the god of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> And the king of Assyria commanded saying, Carry thither  one of the priests whom ye have brought away from thence; and  let them go and abide there, and let him teach them the manner  of the god of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:28">17:28</a> Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from  Samaria came and abode in Bethel, and taught them how they  should fear Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:29">17:29</a> And every nation made gods of their own, and put them in  the houses of the high places that the Samaritans had made,  every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:30">17:30</a> And the people of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the  people of Cuth made Nergal, and the people of Hamath made  Ashima,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:31">17:31</a> and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the  Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech  and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:32">17:32</a> So they feared Jehovah, and made to themselves from all  classes of them priests of the high places, who offered  [sacrifices] for them in the houses of the high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:33">17:33</a> They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods after the  manner of the nations, whence they had been carried away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:34">17:34</a> To this day they do after their former customs: they fear  not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes or after  their ordinances, nor after the law and commandment that  Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:35">17:35</a> And Jehovah had made a covenant with them, and charged  them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow down  yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:36">17:36</a> but Jehovah alone, who brought you up out of the land of  Egypt with great power and a stretched-out arm, him shall ye  fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do  sacrifice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:37">17:37</a> And the statutes and the ordinances and the law, and the  commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for  evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:38">17:38</a> And ye shall not forget the covenant that I have made with  you, neither shall ye fear other gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:39">17:39</a> but ye shall fear Jehovah your God, and he shall deliver  you out of the hand of all your enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:40">17:40</a> And they did not hearken, but did after their former  customs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:41">17:41</a> And these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven  images, both their children and their children's children: as  did their fathers, so do they, unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea the son of  Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of  Judah, began to reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Abi, daughter of Zechariah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah,  according to all that David his father had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> He removed the high places, and broke the columns, and cut  down the Asherahs, and broke in pieces the serpent of brass  that Moses had made; for to those days the children of Israel  burned incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel; so that after him  was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor [among any]  that were before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And he clave to Jehovah, and did not turn aside from  following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah  commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And Jehovah was with him; he prospered whithersoever he  went forth. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and  served him not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> He smote the Philistines unto Gazah and its borders, from  the watchmen's tower to the fortified city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah,  which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of  Israel, [that] Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against  Samaria and besieged it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And at the end of three years they took it; in the sixth  year of Hezekiah, that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of  Israel, Samaria was taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria,  and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, the river of Gozan,  and in the cities of the Medes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> because they hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah their  God, but transgressed his covenant, all that Moses the servant  of Jehovah commanded; and they would not hear nor do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib  king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of  Judah, and took them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to  Lachish, saying, I have sinned; retire from me: I will bear  what thou layest upon me. And the king of Assyria laid upon  Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and  thirty talents of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the  house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> At that time Hezekiah stripped the doors of the temple of  Jehovah, and the posts that Hezekiah king of Judah had  overlaid, and gave them to the king of Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and  Rab-shakeh from Lachish, with a strong force, against king  Hezekiah, to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem.  And when they were come up, they came and stood by the aqueduct  of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller's  field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And they called to the king. Then came forth to them  Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the household, and  Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the chronicler.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> And Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus  says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is  this wherein thou trustest?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> Thou sayest -- but it is a word of the lips -- There is  counsel and strength for war. Now on whom dost thou rely, that  thou hast revolted against me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Now behold, thou reliest upon the staff of that broken  reed, upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it goes into his hand  and pierces it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that rely  upon him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And if ye say to me, We rely upon Jehovah our God: is it  not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed,  saying to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this  altar in Jerusalem?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And now, engage, I pray thee, with my master the king of  Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou  canst set the riders upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of  the least of my master's servants? And thou reliest upon Egypt  for chariots and for horsemen!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to  destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and  destroy it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, and Shebnah and Joah said  to Rab-shakeh, Speak, we pray thee, to thy servants in Syriac,  for we understand it, and talk not with us in the Jewish  [language] in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And Rab-shakeh said to them, Is it to thy master and to  thee that my master sent me to speak these words? Is it not to  the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung  and drink their own urine with you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> And Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the  Jewish [language], and spoke and said, Hear the word of the  great king, the king of Assyria!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he  will not be able to deliver you out of the [king's] hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> Neither let Hezekiah make you rely upon Jehovah, saying,  Jehovah will certainly deliver us, and this city shall not be  given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:31">18:31</a> Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of  Assyria: Make peace with me, and come out to me; and eat every  one of his vine and every one of his fig-tree, and drink every  one the waters of his own cistern;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:32">18:32</a> until I come and take you away to a land like your own  land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a  land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live and not die;  and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying,  Jehovah will deliver us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:33">18:33</a> Have any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his  land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:34">18:34</a> Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? Where are the  gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? and have they delivered  Samaria out of my hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:35">18:35</a> Which are they among all the gods of the countries, who  have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah  should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:36">18:36</a> But the people were silent and answered him not a word;  for the king's command was, saying, Answer him not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:37">18:37</a> And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the  household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph,  the chronicler, came to Hezekiah with their garments rent, and  told him the words of Rab-shakeh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard [it], that he  rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went  into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna  the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with  sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day  of trouble and of rebuke and of reviling; for the children are  come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of  Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to  reproach the living God; and will rebuke the words which  Jehovah thy God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the  remnant that is left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master:  Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast  heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have  blasphemed me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear  tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will make him  to fall by the sword in his own land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria  warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed  from Lachish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he  has come forth to make war with thee. And he sent messengers  again to Hezekiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah saying: Let  not thy God, upon whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying,  Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of  Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have  done to all countries, destroying them utterly; and shalt thou  be delivered?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have  destroyed delivered them: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the  children of Eden that were in Thelassar?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and  the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the  messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of  Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah and said, Jehovah, God  of Israel, who sittest [between] the cherubim, thou, the Same,  thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou  hast made the heavens and the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> Incline thine ear, Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine  eyes, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent  him to reproach the living God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste  the nations and their lands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no  gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore  have they destroyed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And now, Jehovah our God, I beseech thee, save us out of  his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that  thou, Jehovah, art God, thou only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus  saith Jehovah the God of Israel: That which thou hast prayed to  me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him: The  virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn;  The daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom  hast thou exalted the voice? Against the Holy one of Israel  hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast  said, With the multitude of my chariots have I come up To the  height of the mountain, to the recesses of Lebanon, And I will  cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its cypresses; And I  will enter into its furthest lodging-place, [into] the forest  of its fruitful field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> I have digged, and have drunk strange waters, And with the  sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> Hast thou not heard long ago that I have done it? And that  from ancient days I formed it? Now have I brought it to pass,  that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous  heaps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:26">19:26</a> And their inhabitants were powerless, They were dismayed  and put to shame; They were [as] the growing grass, and [as]  the green herb, [As] the grass on the housetops, and grain  blighted before it be grown up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:27">19:27</a> But I know thine abode, and thy going out, and thy coming  in, And thy raging against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:28">19:28</a> Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come  up into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my  bridle in thy lips, And I will make thee go back by the way by  which thou camest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:29">19:29</a> And this [shall be] the sign unto thee: They shall eat  this year such as groweth of itself, And in the second year  that which springeth of the same; But in the third year sow ye  and reap, And plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:30">19:30</a> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah  Shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:31">19:31</a> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, And out of  mount Zion they that escape: The zeal of Jehovah [of hosts]  shall do this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:32">19:32</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of  Assyria: He shall not come into this city, Nor shoot an arrow  there, Nor come before it with shield, Nor cast a bank against  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:33">19:33</a> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, And  shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:34">19:34</a> And I will defend this city, to save it, For mine own  sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:35">19:35</a> And it came to pass that night, that an angel of Jehovah  went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred  and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the  morning, behold, they were all dead bodies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and  returned, and abode at Nineveh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:37">19:37</a> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of  Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer [his sons] smote  him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.  And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet  Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, Thus saith  Jehovah: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not  live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> Ah! Jehovah, remember, I beseech thee, how I have walked  before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done  what is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And it came to pass before Isaiah had gone out into the  middle city that the word of Jehovah came to him saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> Return, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus  saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy  prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee: on the  third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> and I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will  deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of  Assyria, and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for  my servant David's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and  laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What [shall be] the sign that  Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of  Jehovah the third day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Isaiah said, This [shall be] the sign to thee from  Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken:  shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten  degrees?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And Hezekiah said, It is a light thing for the shadow to  go down ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten  degrees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah, and he brought  the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the  dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> At that time Berodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of  Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, for he had  heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and shewed them all his  treasure-house, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the  fine oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was  found among his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor  in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not shew them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> Then came the prophet Isaiah to king Hezekiah and said to  him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee?  And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, from Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And  Hezekiah said, All that is in my house have they seen: there is  nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> Behold, days come that all that is in thy house, and what  thy fathers have laid up until this day, shall be carried to  Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou  shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be  chamberlains in the palace of the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah  which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not so? if only  there shall be peace and truth in my days!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might,  and how he made the pool and the aqueduct, and brought the  water into the city, are they not written in the book of the  chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son  reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and  he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Hephzibah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the  abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from  before the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father  had destroyed; and he reared up altars to Baal and made an  Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the  host of heaven, and served them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which  Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both  courts of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And he caused his son to pass through the fire, and used  magic and divination, and appointed necromancers and  soothsayers: he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of  Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And he set the graven image of the Asherah that he had  made, in the house of which Jehovah had said to David and to  Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have  chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for  ever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> neither will I any more cause the foot of Israel to wander  away from the land that I gave their fathers; if they will only  take heed to do according to all that I have commanded them,  and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> But they would not hearken, and Manasseh led them astray to  do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had destroyed from  before the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And Jehovah spoke by his servants the prophets saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these  abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the  Amorites did, who were before him, and hath made Judah also to  sin with his idols;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I  will bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever  heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and  the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as  one wipeth a pan, wiping it and turning it upside down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and  deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall  become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> because they have done evil in my sight, and have provoked  me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of  Egypt even to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had  filled Jerusalem [with it] from one end to another; beside his  sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight  of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did,  and his sin which he sinned, are they not written in the book  of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the  garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his  son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and  he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was  Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, as Manasseh his  father had done;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> and he walked in all the way that his father had walked  in, and served the idols that his father had served, and  worshipped them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> and he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers, and walked  not in the way of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew  the king in his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> But the people of the land smote all them that had  conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made  Josiah his son king in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> And the rest of the acts of Amon, what he did, are they  not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of  Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza;  and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he  reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Bozcath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, and  walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside  to the right hand nor to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,  [that] the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of  Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> Go up to Hilkijah the high priest, that he may sum up the  money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the  doorkeepers have gathered of the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> and let them give it into the hand of them that do the  work, that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let  them give it to those that do the work in the house of Jehovah,  to repair the breaches of the house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> to the carpenters and the builders and the masons, and to  buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> But no reckoning was made with them of the money that was  given into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And Hilkijah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I  have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And  Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the  king word again and said, Thy servants have emptied out the  money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into  the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of  the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying, Hilkijah  the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the  king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the  book of the law, that he rent his garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And the king commanded Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam the  son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the  scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for  all Judah, concerning the words of this book which is found;  for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us,  because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this  book, to do according to all that is written [there] for us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and  Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of  Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the  wardrobe: now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [of  the town]; and they spoke with her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of  Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon this  place and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the words of the  book that the king of Judah hath read.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense  unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all  the work of their hands, therefore my fury is kindled against  this place, and shall not be quenched.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of  Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the God  of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble  thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spoke against  this place and against the inhabitants thereof, that they  should become a desolation and a curse, and didst rend thy  garments and weep before me, I also have heard [thee], saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> Therefore, behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers,  and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine  eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this  place. And they brought the king word again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders  of Judah and of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> And the king went up into the house of Jehovah, and all the  men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and  the priests and the prophets, and all the people, both small  and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book  of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And the king stood on the dais, and made a covenant before  Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments  and his testimonies and his statutes with all [his] heart, and  with all [his] soul, to establish the words of this covenant  that are written in this book. And all the people stood to the  covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And the king commanded Hilkijah the high priest, and the  priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring  forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that had  been made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host  of the heavens; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the  fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And he abolished the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of  Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the  cities of Judah, and the environs of Jerusalem; and them that  burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the  constellations, and to all the host of heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah,  outside Jerusalem, to the torrent of Kidron, and burned it at  the torrent of Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast  the powder upon the graves of the children of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, which were  in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove tents for the  Asherah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah,  and defiled the high places where the priests had burned  incense, from Geba even to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the  high places of the gates, those at the entrance of the gate of  Joshua the governor of the city, [and] those on the left hand  of any [going in] at the gate of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to  the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they ate of the  unleavened bread among their brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the sons  of Hinnom, that no man might cause his son or his daughter to  pass through the fire to Molech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> And he abolished the horses that the kings of Judah had  appointed to the sun at the entrance of the house of Jehovah,  by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in  the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun, with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> And the king broke down the altars that were on the roof  of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had  made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts  of the house of Jehovah, and he shattered them, [removing them]  from thence, and cast the powder of them into the torrent of  Kidron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were  on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the  king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the  Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and  for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the  king defile.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And he broke in pieces the columns, and cut down the  Asherahs, and filled their place with the bones of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, the high place that  Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, had made,  both that altar and the high place he broke down; and burned  the high place, stamped it small to powder, and burned the  Asherah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> And Josiah turned himself, and saw the sepulchres that  were there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of  the sepulchres, and burned [them] upon the altar, and defiled  it, according to the word of Jehovah, that the man of God had  proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> Then he said, What tombstone is that which I see? And the  men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God  who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which thou hast  done against the altar of Bethel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. And  they saved his bones, with the bones of the prophet that came  out of Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> And all the houses also of the high places that were in  the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to  provoke [Jehovah] to anger, Josiah removed, and did to them  according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And he sacrificed upon the altars all the priests of the  high places that were there, and burned men's bones upon them.  And he returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> And the king commanded all the people saying, Hold the  passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of  the covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> For there was not holden such a passover from the days of  the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings  of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this  passover holden to Jehovah in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> Moreover the necromancers and the soothsayers, and the  teraphim and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen  in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah took away, that  he might perform the words of the law which were written in the  book that Hilkijah the priest had found in the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> And before him there had been no king like him that turned  to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with  all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after  him arose there his like.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> But Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great  wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because  of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my  sight, as I have removed Israel, and will reject this city  Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said,  My name shall be there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did,  are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings  of Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> In his days Pharaoh-Nechoh king of Egypt went up against  the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah  went against him; but [Nechoh] slew him at Megiddo, when he had  seen him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from  Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his  own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son  of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's  stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to  reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his  mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all  that his fathers had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> And Pharaoh-Nechoh had him bound at Riblah in the land of  Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and laid a  tribute upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and a  talent of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king  instead of Josiah his father, and changed his name to  Jehoiakim. And he took Jehoahaz; and he came to Egypt, and died  there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but  he laid a proportional tax on the land to give the money  according to the command of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and  the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to  his estimation, to give it to Pharaoh-Nechoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:36">23:36</a> Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to  reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his  mother's name was Zebuddah, daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:37">23:37</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all  that his fathers had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and  Jehoiakim was his servant three years; then he turned and  rebelled against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Jehovah sent against him the bands of the Chaldeans,  and the bands of the Syrians, and the bands of the Moabites,  and the bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against  Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he  spoke through his servants the prophets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> Verily, at the commandment of Jehovah it came to pass  against Judah, that they should be removed out of his sight,  for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> and also [because of] the innocent blood that he had shed;  for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Jehovah  would not pardon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,  are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings  of Judah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his  son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his  land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to  the king of Egypt, from the torrent of Egypt to the river  Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all  that his father had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of  Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city,  while his servants were besieging it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of  Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes,  and his chamberlains; and the king of Babylon took him in the  eighth year of his reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> And he brought out thence all the treasures of the house  of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in  pieces all the vessels of gold that Solomon king of Israel had  made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes,  and all the mighty men of valour, ten thousand captives, and  all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained but the poorest  sort of the people of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's  mother, and the king's wives, and his chamberlains, and the  mighty of the land, he led into captivity from Jerusalem to  Babylon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> and all the men of valour, seven thousand, and the  craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all strong men apt for war,  and the king of Babylon brought them captive to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his uncle king in  his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all  that Jehoiakim had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> For, because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem  and against Judah, until he had cast them out from his  presence, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the  tenth month, on the tenth of the month, [that] Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem,  and encamped against it; and they built turrets against it  round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king  Zedekiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> On the ninth of the [fourth] month the famine prevailed in  the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And the city was broken into; and all the men of war [fled]  by night, by the way of the gate between the two walls, which  [leads] to the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were by the  city round about); and they went the way toward the plain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and  overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was  scattered from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And they took the king, and brought him up to the king of  Babylon unto Riblah; and they pronounced judgment upon him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> and slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and  put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with chains of  brass, and carried him to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, which  was in the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of  Babylon, Nebuzar-adan, captain of the body-guard, servant of  the king of Babylon, came unto Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house,  and all the houses of Jerusalem; and every great [man's] house  he burned with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the  captain of the body-guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem  round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried  away captive the rest of the people that were left in the city,  and the deserters that had deserted to the king of Babylon, and  the rest of the multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> But the captain of the body-guard left of the poor of the  land for vinedressers and husbandmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah,  and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of  Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the brass  thereof to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> The cauldrons also and the shovels and the knives and the  cups, and all the vessels of copper wherewith they ministered,  they took away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> And the censers and the bowls, that which was of gold in  gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of  the body-guard took away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases which Solomon  had made for the house of Jehovah: for the brass of all these  vessels there was no weight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the  capital upon it was brass, and the height of the capital three  cubits; and the network and the pomegranates, upon the capital  round about, all of brass: and similarly for the second pillar  with the network.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the high  priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three  doorkeepers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:19">25:19</a> And out of the city he took a chamberlain that was set  over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the  king's presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of  the captain of the host, who enrolled the people of the land;  and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the  city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:20">25:20</a> And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them  and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:21">25:21</a> and the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death  at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away  captive out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:22">25:22</a> And [as for] the people that remained in the land of  Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left behind,  over them he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of  Shaphan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:23">25:23</a> And all the captains of the forces, they and their men,  heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, and they  came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of  Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son  of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a  Maachathite, they and their men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:24">25:24</a> And Gedaliah swore unto them and to their men, and said to  them, Fear not to be servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the  land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:25">25:25</a> And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the  son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came,  and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the  Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> And all the people, both small and great, and the captains  of the forces, arose and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of  the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the  captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on  the twenty-seventh of the month, [that] Evil-Merodach king of  Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head  of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:28">25:28</a> and he spoke kindly to him, and set his seat above the  seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:29">25:29</a> And he changed his prison garments; and he ate bread  before him continually all the days of his life;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:30">25:30</a> and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by  the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.</p>
