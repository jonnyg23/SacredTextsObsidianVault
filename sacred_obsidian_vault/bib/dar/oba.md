  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Obadiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah  concerning Edom: We have heard a report from Jehovah, and an  ambassador is sent among the nations. Arise ye, and let us rise  up against her in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Behold, I have made thee small among the nations; thou art  greatly despised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, thou that  dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;  -- he that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the  ground?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set  thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> If thieves had come to thee, if robbers by night, (how art  thou cut off!) would they not have stolen [till] they had had  enough? If grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not  have left some gleanings?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> How is Esau searched! his hidden things sought out!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> All the men of thy confederacy have pushed thee to the  border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived  thee, they have prevailed against thee; [they that eat] thy  bread have laid a snare under thee. There is no understanding  in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, destroy the wise men  out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end  that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by  slaughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Because of violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall  cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day  that strangers carried away captive his substance, and  foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon  Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy  brother in the day of his disaster; neither shouldest thou have  rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their  destruction; nor have opened wide thy mouth in the day of  distress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people  in the day of their calamity, nor have looked, even thou, on  their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither  shouldest thou have laid [hands] on their substance in the day  of their calamity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and thou shouldest not have stood on the crossway, to cut  off those of his that did escape, nor have delivered up those  remaining of him in the day of distress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as  thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy recompence  shall return upon thine own head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all  the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and shall  swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> But upon mount Zion shall there be deliverance, and it  shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their  possessions.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of  Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble; and they  shall kindle in them and devour them; and there shall not be  any remaining of the house of Esau: for Jehovah hath spoken  [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And [they of] the south shall possess the mount of Esau;  and they of the lowland the Philistines; yea, they shall  possess the field of Ephraim and the field of Samaria; and  Benjamin [shall possess] Gilead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> and the captives of this host of the children of Israel  [shall possess] what belonged to the Canaanites, unto  Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who [were] in  Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And saviours shall come up on mount Zion, to judge the  mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Jehovah's.</p>
