  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: James</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> James, bondman of God and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, to the  twelve tribes which [are] in the dispersion, greeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various  temptations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> knowing that the proving of your faith works endurance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> But let endurance have [its] perfect work, that ye may be  perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> But if any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who  gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given  to him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting. For he that  doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed  about;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> for let not that man think that he shall receive anything  from the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> [he is] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> But let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> and the rich in his humiliation, because as [the] grass's  flower he will pass away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> For the sun has risen with its burning heat, and has  withered the grass, and its flower has fallen, and the  comeliness of its look has perished: thus the rich also shall  wither in his goings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Blessed [is the] man who endures temptation; for, having  been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which He has  promised to them that love him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Let no man, being tempted, say, I am tempted of God. For  God cannot be tempted by evil things, and himself tempts no  one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> But every one is tempted, drawn away, and enticed by his  own lust;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> then lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; but sin  fully completed brings forth death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from  above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor  shadow of turning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> According to his own will begat he us by the word of truth,  that we should be a certain first-fruits of *his* creatures.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> So that, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to  hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> for man's wrath does not work God's righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Wherefore, laying aside all filthiness and abounding of  wickedness, accept with meekness the implanted word, which is  able to save your souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> But be ye doers of [the] word and not hearers only,  beguiling yourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> For if any man be a hearer of [the] word and not a doer,  *he* is like to a man considering his natural face in a mirror:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> for he has considered himself and is gone away, and  straightway he has forgotten what he was like.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> But *he* that fixes his view on [the] perfect law, that of  liberty, and abides in [it], being not a forgetful hearer but a  doer of [the] work, *he* shall be blessed in his doing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> If any one think himself to be religious, not bridling his  tongue, but deceiving his heart, this man's religion is vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is  this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep  oneself unspotted from the world.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> My brethren, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,  [Lord] of glory, with respect of persons:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> for if there come unto your synagogue a man with a gold ring  in splendid apparel, and a poor man also come in in vile  apparel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and ye look upon him who wears the splendid apparel, and  say, Do thou sit here well, and say to the poor, Do thou stand  there, or sit here under my footstool:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> have ye not made a difference among yourselves, and become  judges having evil thoughts?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Hear, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen the poor as to  the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he  has promised to them that love him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But *ye* have despised the poor [man]. Do not the rich  oppress you, and [do not] *they* drag you before [the]  tribunals?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And [do not] *they* blaspheme the excellent name which has  been called upon you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> If indeed ye keep [the] royal law according to the  scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do  well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being  convicted by the law as transgressors.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For whoever shall keep the whole law and shall offend in  one [point], he has come under the guilt of [breaking] all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> For he who said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also,  Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but  killest, thou art become transgressor of [the] law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> So speak ye, and so act, as those that are to be judged by  [the] law of liberty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> for judgment [will be] without mercy to him that has shewn  no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> What [is] the profit, my brethren, if any one say he have  faith, but have not works? can faith save him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Now if a brother or a sister is naked and destitute of  daily food,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and one from amongst you say to them, Go in peace, be  warmed and filled; but give not to them the needful things for  the body, what [is] the profit?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> But some one will say, *Thou* hast faith and *I* have  works. Shew me thy faith without works, and *I* from my works  will shew thee my faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> *Thou* believest that God is one. Thou doest well. The  demons even believe, and tremble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is  dead?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had  offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and that by  works faith was perfected.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham  believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and  he was called Friend of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Ye see that a man is justified on the principle of works,  and not on the principle of faith only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> But was not in like manner also Rahab the harlot justified  on the principle of works, when she had received the messengers  and put [them] forth by another way?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith  without works is dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall  receive greater judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> For we all often offend. If any one offend not in word, *he*  [is] a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that  they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by  violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder,  wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great  things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the  tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body,  and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire  of hell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of  creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed  by the human species;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an  unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse  we men made after [the] likeness of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It  is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth  sweet and bitter?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs?  Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out  of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts,  do not boast and lie against the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but  earthly, natural, devilish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder  and every evil thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful,  gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning,  unfeigned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them  that make peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Whence [come] wars and whence fightings among you? [Is it]  not thence, -- from your pleasures, which war in your members?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Ye lust and have not: ye kill and are full of envy, and  cannot obtain; ye fight and war; ye have not because ye ask  not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may  consume [it] in your pleasures.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Adulteresses, know ye not that friendship with the world is  enmity with God? Whoever therefore is minded to be [the] friend  of the world is constituted enemy of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Think ye that the scripture speaks in vain? Does the Spirit  which has taken his abode in us desire enviously?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says, God sets himself  against [the] proud, but gives grace to [the] lowly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Subject yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and  he will flee from you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse  [your] hands, sinners, and purify [your] hearts, ye  double-minded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Be wretched, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be  turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Humble yourselves before [the] Lord, and he shall exalt  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Speak not against one another, brethren. He that speaks  against [his] brother, or judges his brother, speaks against  [the] law and judges [the] law. But if thou judgest [the] law,  thou art not doer of [the] law, but judge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> One is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to  destroy: but who art *thou* who judgest thy neighbour?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Go to now, ye who say, To-day or to-morrow will we go into  such a city and spend a year there, and traffic and make gain,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> ye who do not know what will be on the morrow, ([for] what  [is] your life? It is even a vapour, appearing for a little  while, and then disappearing,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> instead of your saying, If the Lord should [so] will and we  should live, we will also do this or that.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is  evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> To him therefore who knows how to do good, and does it not,  to him it is sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Go to now, ye rich, weep, howling over your miseries that  [are] coming upon [you].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Your wealth is become rotten, and your garments moth-eaten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Your gold and silver is eaten away, and their canker shall  be for a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire.  Ye have heaped up treasure in [the] last days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Behold, the wages of your labourers, who have harvested your  fields, wrongfully kept back by you, cry, and the cries of  those that have reaped are entered into the ears of [the] Lord  of sabaoth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Ye have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged  yourselves; ye have nourished your hearts [as] in a day of  slaughter;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not  resist you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Have patience, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the  Lord. Behold, the labourer awaits the precious fruit of the  earth, having patience for it until it receive [the] early and  [the] latter rain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> *Ye* also have patience: stablish your hearts, for the  coming of the Lord is drawn nigh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Complain not one against another, brethren, that ye be not  judged. Behold, the judge stands before the door.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Take [as] an example, brethren, of suffering and having  patience, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of [the]  Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Behold, we call them blessed who have endured. Ye have  heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord;  that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> But before all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by  heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your  yea be yea, and your nay, nay, that ye do not fall under  judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Does any one among you suffer evil? let him pray. Is any  happy? let him sing psalms.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Is any sick among you? let him call to [him] the elders of  the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with  oil in the name of [the] Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord  shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it  shall be forgiven him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Confess therefore your offences to one another, and pray  for one another, that ye may be healed. [The] fervent  supplication of the righteous [man] has much power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Elias was a man of like passions to us, and he prayed with  prayer that it should not rain; and it did not rain upon the  earth three years and six months;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the  earth caused its fruit to spring forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> My brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and  one bring him back,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> let him know that he that brings back a sinner from [the]  error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a  multitude of sins.</p>
