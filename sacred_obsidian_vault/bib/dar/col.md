  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Colossians</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus, by God's will, and Timotheus  the brother,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which [are] in  Colosse. Grace to you and peace from God our Father [and Lord  Jesus Christ].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus  Christ continually [when] praying for you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love  which ye have towards all the saints,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> on account of the hope which [is] laid up for you in the  heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of  the glad tidings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> which are come to you, as [they are] in all the world, [and]  are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the  day ye heard [them] and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman,  who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> who has also manifested to us your love in [the] Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> For this reason *we* also, from the day we heard [of your  faith and love], do not cease praying and asking for you, to  the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his  will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> [so as] to walk worthily of the Lord unto all  well-pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by  the true knowledge of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> strengthened with all power according to the might of his  glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for  sharing the portion of the saints in light,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and  translated [us] into the kingdom of the Son of his love:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all  creation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> because by him were created all things, the things in the  heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the  invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or  authorities: all things have been created by him and for him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And *he* is before all, and all things subsist together by  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And *he* is the head of the body, the assembly; who is  [the] beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that *he* might  have the first place in all things:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> for in him all the fulness [of the Godhead] was pleased to  dwell,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> and by him to reconcile all things to itself, having made  peace by the blood of his cross -- by him, whether the things  on the earth or the things in the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And you, who once were alienated and enemies in mind by  wicked works, yet now has it reconciled</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy  and unblamable and irreproachable before it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> if indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm, and not  moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have  heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which  [is] under heaven, of which *I* Paul became minister.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that  which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for  his body, which is the assembly;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> of which *I* became minister, according to the dispensation  of God which [is] given me towards you to complete the word of  God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> the mystery which [has been] hidden from ages and from  generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> to whom God would make known what are the riches of the  glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you  the hope of glory:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> whom *we* announce, admonishing every man, and teaching  every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every  man perfect in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> Whereunto also I toil, combating according to his working,  which works in me in power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> For I would have you know what combat I have for you, and  those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in  flesh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united  together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of  understanding, to [the] full knowledge of the mystery of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of  knowledge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And I say this to the end that no one may delude you by  persuasive speech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> For if indeed in the flesh I am absent, yet I am with you in  spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of  your faith in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord,  walk in him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even  as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> See that there be no one who shall lead *you* away as a prey  through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching  of men, according to the elements of the world, and not  according to Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all  principality and authority,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> in whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision not  done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in  the circumcision of the Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also  raised with [him] through faith of the working of God who  raised him from among the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And you, being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision  of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having  forgiven us all the offences;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which [stood  out] against us, which was contrary to us, he has taken it also  out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a  show of them publicly, leading them in triumph by it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Let none therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in  matter of feast, or new moon, or sabbaths,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of  Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Let no one fraudulently deprive you of your prize, doing  his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into  things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of  his flesh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and not holding fast the head, from whom all the body,  ministered to and united together by the joints and bands,  increases with the increase of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world,  why as [if] alive in [the] world do ye subject yourselves to  ordinances?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> (things which are all for destruction in the using [of  them]:) according to the injunctions and teachings of men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> (which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary  worship, and humility, and harsh treatment of the body, not in  a certain honour,) to [the] satisfaction of the flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the  things [which are] above, where the Christ is, sitting at [the]  right hand of God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> have your mind on the things [that are] above, not on the  things [that are] on the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> When the Christ is manifested who [is] our life, then shall  *ye* also be manifested with him in glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Put to death therefore your members which [are] upon the  earth, fornication, uncleanness, vile passions, evil lust, and  unbridled desire, which is idolatry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> On account of which things the wrath of God comes upon the  sons of disobedience.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> In which *ye* also once walked when ye lived in these  things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> But now, put off, *ye* also, all [these] things, wrath,  anger, malice, blasphemy, vile language out of your mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with  his deeds,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge  according to [the] image of him that has created him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and  uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but  Christ [is] everything, and in all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Put on therefore, as [the] elect of God, holy and beloved,  bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness,  longsuffering;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any  should have a complaint against any; even as the Christ has  forgiven you, so also [do] *ye*.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And to all these [add] love, which is the bond of  perfectness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to  which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all  wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns,  spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, [do]  all things in [the] name of [the] Lord Jesus, giving thanks to  God the Father by him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> Wives, be subject to [your] husbands, as is fitting in  [the] Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is  well-pleasing in [the] Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> Fathers, do not vex your children, to the end that they be  not disheartened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Bondmen, obey in all things your masters according to  flesh; not with eye-services, as men-pleasers, but in  simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as [doing it] to  the Lord, and not to men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> knowing that of [the] Lord ye shall receive the recompense  of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has  done, and there is no respect of persons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Masters, give to bondmen what is just and fair, knowing that  *ye* also have a Master in [the] heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to  us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ, on  account of which also I am bound,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> to the end that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Walk in wisdom towards those without, redeeming  opportunities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> [Let] your word [be] always with grace, seasoned with salt,  [so as] to know how ye ought to answer each one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and  fellow-bondman in [the] Lord, will make known to you all that  concerns me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he might  know your state, and that he might encourage your hearts:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is  [one] of you. They shall make known to you everything here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Aristarchus my fellow-captive salutes you, and Mark,  Barnabas's cousin, concerning whom ye have received orders, (if  he come to you, receive him,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> and Jesus called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These  [are the] only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have  been a consolation to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Epaphras, who is [one] of you, [the] bondman of Christ  Jesus, salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in  prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in  all [the] will of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> For I bear him witness that he labours much for you, and  them in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Luke, the beloved physician, salutes you, and Demas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> Salute the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the  assembly which [is] in his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And when the letter has been read among you, cause that it  be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans, and that *ye* also  read that from Laodicea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou  hast received in [the] Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.  Grace [be] with you.</p>
