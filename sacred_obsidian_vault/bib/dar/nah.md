  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Nahum</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the  Elkoshite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> A jealous and avenging ùGod is Jehovah: an avenger is  Jehovah, and full of fury: Jehovah taketh vengeance on his  adversaries, and he reserveth [wrath] for his enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in power, and doth not  at all clear [the guilty]: Jehovah, -- his way is in the  whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his  feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all  the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of  Lebanon languisheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt, and the  earth is upheaved at his presence, and the world, and all that  dwell therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Who shall stand before his indignation? and who shall abide  in the fierceness of his anger? His fury is poured out like  fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he  knoweth them that trust in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of the  place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> What do ye imagine against Jehovah? He will make a full end:  trouble shall not rise up the second time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Though they be tangled together [as] thorns, and be as  drenched from their drink, they shall be devoured as dry  stubble, completely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Out of thee is gone forth one that imagineth evil against  Jehovah, a wicked counsellor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be complete in number, and  many as they be, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall  pass away; and though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict  thee no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst  thy bonds asunder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no  more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy god will I  cut off the graven image, and the molten image: I will prepare  thy grave; for thou art vile.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth  glad tidings, that publisheth peace! Celebrate thy feasts,  Judah, perform thy vows: for the wicked one shall no more pass  through thee; he is utterly cut off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thy face: keep  the fortress, watch the way, make [thy] loins strong, fortify  [thy] power mightily.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> For Jehovah hath brought again the glory of Jacob, as the  glory of Israel; for the wasters have wasted them, and marred  their vine-branches.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men  are in scarlet: the chariots [glitter] with the sheen of steel,  in the day of his preparation, and the spears are brandished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> The chariots rush madly in the streets, they justle one  against another in the broad ways: the appearance of them is  like torches, they run like lightnings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> He bethinketh him of his nobles: they stumble in their  march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the shelter is  prepared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace melteth  away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And it is decreed: she shall be uncovered, she shall be led  away, and her maids shall moan as with the voice of doves,  drumming upon their breasts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Nineveh hath been like a pool of water, since the day she  existed, yet they flee away. ... Stand! Stand! But none looketh  back.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Plunder the silver, plunder the gold; for there is no end of  the splendid store of all precious vessels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth,  and the knees smite together, and writhing pain is in all  loins, and all their faces grow pale.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Where is [now] the den of the lions, and the feeding-place  of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, [and] the  lion's whelp walked, and none made them afraid?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps, and  strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,  and his dens with ravin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts: and I  will burn her chariots into smoke; and the sword shall devour  thy young lions, and I will cut off thy prey from the earth;  and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies [and]  violence; the prey departeth not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> The crack of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of the  wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the bounding  chariots!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> The horseman springing up, and the glitter of the sword, and  the flash of the spear, and a multitude of slain, and a mass of  carcases, and no end of corpses: they stumble over their  corpses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> -- Because of the multitude of the fornications of the  well-favoured harlot, mistress of sorceries, that selleth  nations through her fornications, and families through her  sorceries,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts; and I  will uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the  nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee  vile, and will set thee as a gazing stock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And it shall come to pass, [that] all they that see thee  shall flee from thee, and shall say, Nineveh is laid waste! Who  will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Art thou better than No-Amon, that was situate among the  rivers, [that had] the waters round about her, whose rampart  was the sea, [and] of the sea was her wall?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Ethiopia was her strength, and Egypt, and it was infinite;  Phut and the Libyans were her helpers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> She too was carried away, she went into captivity: her  infants also were dashed in pieces, at the top of all the  streets; and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her  great men were bound with chains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid; thou also  shalt seek a refuge from the enemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> All thy strongholds are [like] fig-trees with the  first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they even fall into the  mouth of the eater.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are [as] women: the  gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies; the  fire devoureth thy bars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Draw thee water for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses;  go into the clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the  brick-kiln.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee  off; it shall devour thee like the cankerworm. Make thyself  many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Thou hast multiplied thy merchants more than the stars of  the heavens; the cankerworm spreadeth himself out and flieth  away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Thy chosen men are as the locusts, and thy captains as  swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold  day: when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is  not known where they are.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles lie  still; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and no man  gathereth them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> There is no healing of thy breach; thy wound is grievous;  all that hear the report of thee clap the hands over thee; for  upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</p>
