  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Deuteronomy</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this  side the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain, opposite to  Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of  mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh  month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the  children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had given him  in command to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who  dwelt at Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at  Ashtaroth [and] at Edrei.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> On this side the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to  unfold this law, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have  stayed long enough in this mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of  the Amorites, and unto all the neighbouring places in the  plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south,  and by the seaside, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon,  unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess  the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to  Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to  bear you myself alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are  this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times  so many more as ye are, and bless you as he hath said unto you!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> How can I myself alone sustain your wear, and your burden,  and your strife?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Provide you wise and understanding and known men, according  to your tribes, that I may make them your chiefs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And ye answered me, and said, The thing that thou hast  spoken is good [for us] to do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> So I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise men and known,  and made them chiefs over you, captains of thousands, and  captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of  tens, and officers for your tribes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the  causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between a  man and his brother, and him also that sojourneth with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment: ye shall hear the  small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face  of man, for the judgment is God's; and the matter that is too  hard for you shall ye bring to me, that I may hear it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And I commanded you at that time all the things that ye  should do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And we departed from Horeb and went through all that great  and terrible wilderness, which ye saw, on the way to the  mountain of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us;  and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the  Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go  up, take possession, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath  said unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And ye came near to me all of you, and said, We will send  men before us, who shall examine the land for us, and bring us  word again of the way by which we must go up, and of the cities  to which we shall come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And the matter was good in mine eyes; and I took twelve men  of you, one man for a tribe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came to  the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And they took of the fruit of the land in their hand, and  brought it down unto us, and brought us answer, and said, The  land is good that Jehovah our God hath given us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> But ye would not go up, and rebelled against the word of  Jehovah your God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah  hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to  deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> Whither shall we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts  melt, saying, [They are] a people greater and taller than we;  the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we  have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> And I said unto you, Be not afraid, neither fear them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for  you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your  eyes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> and in the wilderness where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy  God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that  ye went, until ye came to this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> But In this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> who went in the way before you, to search you out a place  for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you by what way  ye should go, and in the cloud by day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:34">1:34</a> And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth,  and swore, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:35">1:35</a> None among these men, this evil generation, shall in any  wise see that good land, which I swore to give unto your  fathers!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:36">1:36</a> Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it, and to  him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his  children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:37">1:37</a> Also Jehovah was angry with me on your account, saying,  Thou also shalt not go in thither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:38">1:38</a> Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall  go in thither: strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to  inherit it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:39">1:39</a> And your little ones, of whom ye said, They shall be a  prey, and your children, who this day know neither good nor  evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it,  and they shall possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:40">1:40</a> But ye, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by  the way of the Red sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:41">1:41</a> -- And ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against  Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah  our God hath commanded us. And ye girded on every man his  weapons of war, and ye would go presumptuously up the hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:42">1:42</a> And Jehovah said to me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither  fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your  enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:43">1:43</a> And I spoke unto you, but ye would not hear, and ye  rebelled against the word of Jehovah, and acted presumptuously,  and went up the hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:44">1:44</a> And the Amorite that dwelt on that hill came out against  you, and chased you, like as bees do, and cut you in pieces in  Seir, as far as Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:45">1:45</a> And ye returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would  not listen to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:46">1:46</a> And ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days  that ye abode [there].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by  the way of the Red sea, as Jehovah had said unto me; and we  went round mount Seir many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And Jehovah spoke to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Ye have gone round this mountain long enough: turn you  northward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And command the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the  border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in  Seir; and they will be afraid of you; and ye shall be very  guarded:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> attack them not; for I will not give you of their land, no,  not so much as a foot-breadth; for I have given mount Seir as a  possession unto Esau.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Ye shall buy of them food for money, that ye may eat; and  water shall ye also buy of them for money, that ye may drink;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy  hand. He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness:  these forty years hath Jehovah thy God been with thee; thou  hast lacked nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who  dwelt in Seir, by the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-geber, and  we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And Jehovah said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither  engage with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their  land a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given Ar  as a possession.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> (The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and  many, and tall as the Anakim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> They also are reckoned as giants like the Anakim; but the  Moabites call them Emim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And in Seir dwelt the Horites in times past; and the  children of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from  before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the  land of their possession, which Jehovah gave to them.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Now rise up, and pass over the torrent Zered. And we passed  over the torrent Zered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Now the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we  had come over the torrent Zered, were thirty-eight years; until  the whole generation of the men of war was consumed from the  midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them to destroy  them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed,  having died off from among the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> that Jehovah spoke to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Thou art to pass this day over the border of Moab, [which  is] Ar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and come near over against the children of Ammon; thou  shalt not distress them nor attack them; for I will not give  thee of the land of the children of Ammon a possession; for  unto the children of Lot have I given it as a possession.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> (That also is reckoned a land of giants: giants dwelt  therein in time past, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; and  Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them,  and dwelt in their stead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> as he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, from  before whom he destroyed the Horites; and they dispossessed  them, and dwelt in their stead, even to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And the Avvites who dwelt in the hamlets as far as Gazah --  the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and  dwelt in their stead.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon.  Behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the king of Heshbon,  the Amorite, and his land: begin, take possession, and engage  with him in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear  of thee upon the peoples under the whole heaven; who will hear  report of thee, and will tremble, and quake because of thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth  unto Sihon the king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> Let me pass through thy land: by the highway alone will I  go; I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> Thou shalt sell me food for money that I may eat; and thou  shalt give me water for money that I may drink; I will only  pass through on my feet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> -- as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the  Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, -- until I shall pass over  the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him;  for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart  obdurate, that he might give him into thy hand, as it is this  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I begin to give Sihon and  his land before thee: begin, take possession, that thou mayest  possess his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> And Sihon came out against us for battle, he and all his  people, to Jahaz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> But Jehovah our God gave him up before us; and we smote  him, and his sons, and his whole people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly  destroyed every city, men, and women, and little ones: we let  none escape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves, and the  spoil of the cities which we took.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> From Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and  the city that is in the ravine even to Gilead, there was not  one city too strong for us: Jehovah our God delivered all  before us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> Only thou didst not approach the land of the children of  Ammon, the whole border of the river Jabbok, nor the cities of  the mountain, nor to whatsoever Jehovah our God had forbidden  us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the  king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, for  battle at Edrei.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And Jehovah said to me, Fear him not; for into thy hand have  I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt  do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites,  who dwelt at Heshbon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Jehovah our God gave into our hand Og the king of Bashan  also, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left  to him remaining.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And we took all his cities at that time: there was not a  town which we took not from them, sixty cities, the whole  region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and  bars; besides unwalled towns very many.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sihon the  king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, men, women and  little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as  booty for ourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two  kings of the Amorites, that were on this side the Jordan, from  the river Arnon to mount Hermon</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it  Senir):</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> all the cities of the plateau, and all Gilead, and all  Bashan, as far as Salchah and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom  of Og in Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> For only Og the king of Bashan remained of the residue of  giants: behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not  in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? its length was nine cubits,  and its breadth four cubits, after the cubit of a man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And this land we took in possession at that time. From  Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and the half of mount  Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the  Gadites;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og,  I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of  Argob, even all Bashan, is called a land of giants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Jair the son of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as  far as the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and  called Bashan after his own name, Havoth-Jair, to this day.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And I gave Gilead to Machir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead  even to the river Arnon, the middle of the ravine and its  border, as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the children  of Ammon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> the plain also, and the Jordan, and [its] border from  Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under  the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God  hath given you this land to take possession of it: ye shall  pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel,  all [who are] combatants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Only your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, --  I know that ye have much cattle, -- shall abide in your cities  which I have given you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> until Jehovah give rest to your brethren, as well as to  you, and they also take possession of the land that Jehovah  your God giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return,  each man to his possession, which I have given you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes  have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to these two  kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms to which thou  shalt go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he will fight  for you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy  greatness, and thy powerful hand; for what ùGod is in the  heavens or in the earth that can do like to thy works, and like  to thy might?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is  beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> But Jehovah was wroth with me on your account, and did not  hear me; and Jehovah said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no  more unto me of this matter!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes  westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and  behold it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this  Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> But charge Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him;  for he shall go over before this people, and he shall put them  in possession of the land which thou shalt see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> And we abode in the valley opposite to Beth-Peor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And now, Israel, hearken to the statutes and to the  ordinances which I teach you, to do [them], that ye may live,  and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your  fathers giveth you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither  shall ye take from it, that ye may keep the commandments of  Jehovah your God which I command you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-Peor;  for all the men that followed Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God hath  destroyed them from among you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> but ye that did cleave to Jehovah your God are alive every  one of you this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as  Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye may do so in the land into  which ye enter to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And ye shall keep and do them; for that will be your wisdom  and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples that  shall hear all these statutes, and say, Verily this great  nation is a wise and understanding people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> For what great nation is there that hath God near to them as  Jehovah our God is in everything we call upon him for?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And what great nation is there that hath righteous statutes  and ordinances, as all this law which I set before you this  day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently,  lest thou forget the things that thine eyes have seen (and lest  they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but thou  shalt make them known to thy sons and to thy sons' sons),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb,  when Jehovah said to me, Gather me the people together, that I  may cause them to hear my words, that they may learn them, and  fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and teach  them to their children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the  mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with  darkness, clouds, and obscurity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And Jehovah spoke to you from the midst of the fire: ye  heard the voice of the words, but ye saw no form; only [ye  heard] a voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you  to do, the ten words; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes  and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye  are passing over to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And take great heed to your souls (for ye saw no form on  the day that Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of  the fire),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image,  the form of any figure, the pattern of male or female,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> the pattern of any beast that is on the earth, the pattern  of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven,</p>

 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> Unto thee it was shewn, that thou mightest know that  Jehovah, he is God -- there is none other besides him.</p>

 <p><a name="an_4:41">4:41</a> Then Moses separated three cities on this side the Jordan  toward the sun-rising,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:42">4:42</a> that the manslayer might flee thither, who should kill his  neighbour unawares, and hated him not previously, that fleeing  to one of these cities, he might live:</p>

 <p><a name="an_4:46">4:46</a> on this side the Jordan, in the valley opposite to  Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who  dwelt in Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote  when they came out of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:47">4:47</a> and they took possession of his land, and the land of Og  the king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on this  side the Jordan, toward the sun-rising;</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear,  Israel, the statutes and the ordinances that I speak in your  ears this day, and learn them, and keep them to do them.</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire  Jehovah spoke with you</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> (I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to declare to  you the word of Jehovah; for ye were afraid by reason of the  fire, and went not up to the mountain), saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> I am Jehovah thy God who have brought thee out of the land  of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image, any form of  what is in the heavens above, or what is in the earth beneath,  or what is in the waters under the earth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for  I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous ùGod, visiting the iniquity of  the fathers upon the sons, and upon the third and upon the  fourth [generation] of them that hate me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and  keep my commandments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God; for  Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that idly uttereth his  name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> Keep the sabbath day to hallow it, as Jehovah thy God hath  commanded thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> but the seventh day is the sabbath of Jehovah thy God: thou  shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor  thy bondman, nor thy handmaid, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor  any of thy cattle, nor thy sojourner that is within thy gates;  that thy bondman and thy handmaid may rest as well as thou.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the  land of Egypt, and that Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence  with a powerful hand and with a stretched-out arm; therefore  Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee to observe the sabbath day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Honour thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God hath  commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may  be well with thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Thou shalt not kill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Neither shalt thou commit adultery.</p>

 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> These words Jehovah spoke to all your congregation on the  mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the  obscurity, with a great voice, and he added no more; and he  wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst  of the darkness, and the mountain burned with fire, that ye  came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God has shewn us his glory  and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst  of the fire: we have seen this day that God talks with man, and  he lives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And now, why should we die? for this great fire will  consume us. If we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more,  we shall die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of  the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we, and  has lived?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> Come thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God will say;  and speak thou to us all that Jehovah our God will speak to  thee; and we will hear it, and do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to  me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the  words of this people that have spoken to thee: they have well  spoken all that they have spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would  fear me, and keep all my commandments continually, that it  might be well with them and with their sons for ever!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> Go, say unto them, Get you into your tents again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak  unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the  ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them  in the land which I give them to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:32">5:32</a> Take heed then to do as Jehovah your God hath commanded  you: turn not aside to the right hand or to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:33">5:33</a> In all the way that Jehovah your God hath commanded you  shall ye walk, that ye may live, and that it may be well with  you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye  shall possess.</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And thou shalt hear, Israel, and take heed to do [them];  that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase  greatly, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath said unto thee,  in a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Hear, Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and  with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in  thy heart;</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And thou shalt bind them for a sign on thy hand, and they  shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and  upon thy gates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into  the land which he swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,  and to Jacob, to give thee: great and good cities which thou  buildedst not,</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in  Massah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your  God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath  commanded thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> And thou shalt do what is right and good in the sight of  Jehovah, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest  enter in and possess the good land which Jehovah swore unto thy  fathers,</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> When thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What  are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,  which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen  in Egypt; and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a powerful  hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> and Jehovah shewed signs and wonders, great and grievous,  upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before  our eyes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> and he brought us out thence, that he might bring us in, to  give us the land which he swore unto our fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear  Jehovah our God, for our good continually, that he might  preserve us alive, as it is this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> And it shall be our righteousness if we take heed to do all  these commandments before Jehovah our God, as he hath commanded  us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither  thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations from  before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the  Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the  Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier  than thou,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> and when Jehovah thy God shall give them up before thee and  thou shalt smite them, then shalt thou utterly destroy them:  thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto  them.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> for he will turn away thy son from following me, and they  will serve other gods, and the anger of Jehovah will be kindled  against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their  altars, and shatter their statues, and hew down their Asherahs,  and burn their graven images with fire.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> but because Jehovah loved you, and because he would keep the  oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought  you out with a powerful hand, and redeemed you out of the house  of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And thou shalt know that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the  faithful ùGod, who keepeth covenant and mercy to a thousand  generations with them that love him and keep his commandments;</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And thou shalt keep the commandment, and the statutes, and  the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these  ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will  keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore unto  thy fathers;</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God  will give up unto thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and  thou shalt not serve their gods; for that would be a snare unto  thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> If thou shouldest say in thy heart, These nations are  greater than I; how can I dispossess them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> fear them not; remember well what Jehovah thy God did unto  Pharaoh, and unto all the Egyptians;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and  the wonders, and the powerful hand, and the stretched-out arm,  whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so will Jehovah thy  God do unto all the peoples whom thou fearest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Moreover, Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them,  until they that are left, and they that hide themselves from  thee, are destroyed.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house,  lest thou be a cursed thing like it: thou shalt utterly detest  it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> Every commandment which I command thee this day shall ye  take heed to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and enter in  and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers.</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, that it is he who  giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his  covenant which he swore unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> And it shall be, if thou do at all forget Jehovah thy God,  and go after other gods, and serve them, and bow down to them,  I testify against you this day that ye shall utterly perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> As the nations which Jehovah is causing to perish before  you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the  voice of Jehovah your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Hear, Israel! Thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to  enter in to possess nations greater and mightier than thou,  cities great and walled up to heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou  knowest, and of whom thou hast heard [say], Who can stand  before the sons of Anak!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Know then this day, that Jehovah thy God is he that goeth  over before thee, a consuming fire; he will destroy them, and  he will cast them down before thee, and thou shalt dispossess  them and cause them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath said  unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Thou shalt not say in thy heart, when Jehovah thy God  thrusteth them out from before thee, saying, For my  righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land;  but for the wickedness of these nations doth Jehovah dispossess  them from before thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy  heart, dost thou enter in to possess their land, but for the  wickedness of these nations doth Jehovah thy God dispossess  them from before thee, and that he may perform the word which  Jehovah swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to  Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Know therefore that Jehovah thy God doth not give thee this  good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a  stiff-necked people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Remember, forget not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to  wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou didst depart  out of the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have  been rebellious against Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And at Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was  angry with you, to destroy you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> when I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone,  the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, and I  abode in the mountain forty days and forty nights, -- I ate no  bread and drank no water, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> -- and Jehovah delivered to me the two tables of stone  written with the finger of God; and on them [was written]  according to all the words which Jehovah spoke with you on the  mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty  nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, the  tables of the covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go down quickly from  hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of  Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside  from the way which I commanded them: they have made for  themselves a molten image.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And Jehovah spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people,  and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their  name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation  mightier and greater than they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And I turned and came down from the mountain, and the  mountain burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant  were in my two hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And I saw, and behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your  God: ye had made for yourselves a molten calf; ye had quickly  turned aside from the way which Jehovah had commanded you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And I seized the two tables, and cast them out of my two  hands, and broke them before your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days  and forty nights, -- I ate no bread and drank no water, --  because of all your sin which ye had sinned, in doing what is  evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For I was afraid of the anger and fury wherewith Jehovah  was wroth against you to destroy you. And Jehovah listened unto  me also at that time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And with Aaron Jehovah was very angry to destroy him; and I  prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burned  it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small, until  it became fine dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook  that flowed down from the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye  provoked Jehovah to wrath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up  and take possession of the land which I have given you, ye  rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God, and ye believed  him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I  knew you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty  nights, as I fell down; for Jehovah had said he would destroy  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> I prayed therefore to Jehovah, and said, Lord Jehovah,  destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast  redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth  out of Egypt with a powerful hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not  at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness,  nor at their sin;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because  Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he had  promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them  out to kill them in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> They are indeed thy people and thine inheritance, which  thou broughtest out with thy great power and with thy  stretched-out arm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew for thyself two  tables of stone like the first, and come up unto me into the  mountain, and make thee an ark of wood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> and I will write on the tables the words that were on the  first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt lay them in  the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two tables of  stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two  tables in my hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And he wrote on the tables, as the first writing, the ten  words which Jehovah spoke unto you on the mountain, from the  midst of the fire, on the day of the assembly, and Jehovah gave  them unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the  tables in the ark which I had made; -- and they are there, as  Jehovah commanded me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> (And the children of Israel took their journey from  Beeroth-Bene-Jaakan to Moserah: there Aaron died, and there he  was buried; and Eleazar his son exercised the priesthood in his  stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah  to Jotbathah, a land of water-brooks.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> At that time Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi, to bear  the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to  do service unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his  brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy  God told him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> But I stood upon the mountain according to the former  days, forty days and forty nights; and Jehovah listened unto me  also at that time: Jehovah would not destroy thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Rise up, take thy journey before  the people, that they may enter in and possess the land, which  I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of  thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and  to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart  and with all thy soul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes,  which I command thee this day, for thy good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to  Jehovah thy God; the earth and all that is therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Only, Jehovah took pleasure in thy fathers, to love them,  and he chose their seed after them, [even] you, out of all the  peoples, as it is this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Circumcise then the foreskin of your heart, and stiffen  your neck no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> For Jehovah your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of  lords, the great ùGod, the mighty and the terrible, who  regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> who executeth the judgment of the fatherless and the  widow, and loveth the stranger, to give him food and clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And ye shall love the stranger; for ye have been strangers  in the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him thou shalt serve, and  unto him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> He is thy praise, and he is thy God, who hath done for  thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have  seen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> With seventy souls thy fathers went down into Egypt; and  now Jehovah thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for  multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Thou shalt love then Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge,  and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments  continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And know ye this day ...; for [I speak] not with your  children who have not known, and who have not seen the  chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his powerful  hand, and his stretched-out arm,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> and his signs and his acts which he did in the midst of  Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses,  and unto their chariots, over which he made the water of the  Red sea flow as they pursued after you, and Jehovah destroyed  them unto this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> -- and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye  came to this place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,  the son of Reuben, -- how the earth opened its mouth, and  swallowed them up, with their households, and their tents, and  all the living substance that belonged to them, in the midst of  all Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which  he hath done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> Keep then all the commandment which I command you this day,  that ye may be strong, and enter in and possess the land,  whither ye pass over to possess it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> and that ye may prolong your days in the land which Jehovah  swore unto your fathers to give unto them and unto their seed,  a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> For the land, whither thou enterest in to possess it, is  not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou  sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden  of herbs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> but the land, whereunto ye are passing over to possess it,  is a land of mountains and valleys, which drinketh water of the  rain of heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> a land which Jehovah thy God careth for; the eyes of  Jehovah thy God are constantly upon it, from the beginning of  the year even unto the end of the year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And it shall come to pass, if ye hearken diligently unto  my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah  your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all  your soul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> that I will give rain to your land in its season, the  early rain and the latter rain; and thou shalt gather in thy  corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> and I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle; and  thou shalt eat and be full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived,  and ye turn aside and serve other gods, and bow down to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> and Jehovah's wrath kindle against you, and he shut up the  heavens, that there be no rain, and that the ground yield not  its produce, and ye perish quickly from off the good land which  Jehovah is giving you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in  your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they  shall be for frontlets between your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And ye shall teach them unto your children, speaking of  them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou goest on the  way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> and write them upon the posts of thy house, and upon thy  gates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your  children, in the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers to  give them, as the days of the heavens [which are] above the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> For if ye diligently keep all this commandment which I  command you [this day] to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to  walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> then will Jehovah dispossess all these nations from before  you, and ye shall take possession of nations greater and  mightier than yourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread  shall be yours; from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the  river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall your  border be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> No man shall be able to stand before you: the fear of you  and the dread of you will Jehovah your God lay upon all the  land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> See, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> a blessing, if ye obey the commandments of Jehovah your  God, which I command you this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> and a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of  Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command  you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God hath  brought thee into the land whither thou enterest in to possess  it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and  the curse upon mount Ebal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, beyond the  way toward the going down of the sun, in the land of the  Canaanites that dwell on the plain opposite to Gilgal, beside  the oaks of Moreh?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> For ye pass over the Jordan to enter in to possess the  land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall take  possession of it, and dwell therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> And ye shall take heed to do all the statutes and  ordinances which I set before you this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> These are the statutes and ordinances, which ye shall take  heed to do in the land, which Jehovah the God of thy fathers is  giving thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations  which ye shall dispossess have served their gods, upon the high  mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> and ye shall break down their altars, and shatter their  statues, and burn their Asherahs with fire; and ye shall hew  down the graven images of their gods, and ye shall destroy the  names of them out of that place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> but unto the place which Jehovah your God will choose out  of all your tribes to set his name there, his habitation shall  ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings and your  sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your  hand, and your vows, and your voluntary-offerings, and the  firstlings of your kine and of your sheep;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> and ye shall eat there before Jehovah your God, and ye  shall rejoice, ye and your households, in all the business of  your hand, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day, each  one whatever is right in his own eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the  inheritance which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> But when ye have gone over the Jordan, and dwell in the  land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and when he  hath given you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye  dwell in safety,</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your  sons, and your daughters, and your bondmen, and your handmaids,  and the Levite that is within your gates; for he hath no  portion nor inheritance with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy  burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> Only, ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon  the earth as water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy  corn, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of  thy kine or of thy sheep, nor any of thy vows which thou  vowest, nor thy voluntary-offerings, nor the heave-offering of  thy hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> but before Jehovah thy God shalt thou eat them in the  place which Jehovah thy God will choose, thou and thy son, and  thy daughter, and thy bondman, and thy handmaid, and the Levite  that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah  thy God in all the business of thy hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite all  the days thou shalt be in thy land.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> Even as the gazelle and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt  eat them: the unclean and the clean alike may eat of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> Only, be sure that thou eat not the blood; for the blood  is the life, and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth  as water:</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> Take heed to hear all these words which I command thee,  that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee  for ever, when thou doest what is good and right in the eyes of  Jehovah thy God.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> A prophet will I raise up unto them from among their  brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth,  and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> But the prophet who shall presume to speak a word in my  name that I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall  speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> When Jehovah thy God hath cut off the nations whose land  Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and thou hast dispossessed them,  and dwellest in their cities and in their houses,</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the territory  of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to inherit, into  three parts, so that every slayer may flee thither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And this is the case of the slayer who shall flee thither  that he may live: he that smiteth his neighbour unwittingly,  whom he hated not previously;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> as when he goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew  wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down  the tree, and the iron slippeth from the handle, and lighteth  upon his neighbour, that he die; such an one shall flee unto  one of these cities, and live;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his  heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and  smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, since  he hated him not previously.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And it shall be, when the officers have ended speaking unto  the people, that they shall place captains of the hosts at the  head of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> When thou approachest unto a city to fight against it,  thou shalt proclaim peace unto it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> and they went and served other gods, and bowed down to  them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not assigned to  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to  bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> And Jehovah thy God will make thee abound in every work of  thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy  cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good; for Jehovah  will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy  fathers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God,  to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in  this book of the law; if thou turn to Jehovah thy God with all  thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> But if thy heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear,  but shalt be drawn away, and thou shalt bow down to other gods  and serve them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish;  ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whereunto thou  passest over the Jordan to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> I call heaven and earth to witness this day against you:  life and death have I set before you, blessing and cursing:  choose then life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> in loving Jehovah thy God, in hearkening to his voice, and  in cleaving to him -- for this is thy life and the length of  thy days -- that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah  swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to  give them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel;</p>

 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> And when Jehovah giveth them up before you, ye shall do to  them according to all the commandment which I have commanded  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Be strong and courageous, fear them not, neither be afraid  of them; for Jehovah thy God, he it is that goeth with thee; he  will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of  all Israel, Be strong and courageous, for thou must go with  this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their  fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> And Jehovah, he it is that goeth before thee: he will be  with thee; he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee; fear not,  neither be dismayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests,  the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah,  and to all the elders of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every  seven years, at the set time of the year of release, at the  feast of tabernacles,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> when all Israel cometh to appear before Jehovah thy God in  the place which he will choose, thou shalt read this law before  all Israel in their ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> Gather the people together, the men, and the women, and  the children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that  they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your  God, and take heed to do all the words of this law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> and that their children who do not know it may hear it and  learn, that they may fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live  in the land, whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, the days are near for thee  to die; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of  meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua  went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> And Jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud;  and the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with  thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring  after the strange gods of the land into which they enter, and  will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,  and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and  they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall  befall them, and they will say in that day, Have not these  evils befallen me because my God is not in my midst?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> And I will entirely hide my face in that day for all the  evils that they have wrought, because they turned unto other  gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> And now, write ye this song, and teach it to the children  of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a  witness for me against the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> For I shall bring them into the land which I swore unto  their fathers, which floweth with milk and honey; and they will  eat and fill themselves, and wax fat, and will turn unto other  gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles  have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them  as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths  of their seed; for I know their imagination which they are  forming already this day, before I bring them into the land  which I have sworn [unto them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> And Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to  the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> And [Jehovah] commanded Joshua the son of Nun, and said,  Be strong and courageous; for thou shalt bring the children of  Israel into the land which I have sworn unto them; and I will  be with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> And it came to pass, when Moses had ended writing the  words of this law in a book, until their conclusion,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> Take this book of the law, and put it at the side of the  ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there  for a witness against thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> for I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck. Lo, while I  am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against  Jehovah; and how much more after my death!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your  officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and take  heaven and earth to witness against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt  yourselves, and will turn aside from the way which I have  commanded you; and mischief will befall you at the end of days;  because ye do evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to  anger through the work of your hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> And Moses spoke in the ears of the whole congregation of  Israel the words of this song, until their conclusion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And hear, O earth,  the words of my mouth!</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> [He is] the Rock, his work is perfect, For all his ways are  righteousness; A ùGod of faithfulness without deceit, Just and  right is he.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> They have dealt corruptly with him; Not his children's is  their spot: -- A crooked and perverted generation!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> Do ye thus requite Jehovah, Foolish and unwise people? Is  not he thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee  and established thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Remember the days of old, Consider the years of generation  to generation; Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; Thine  elders, and they will tell thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> When the Most High assigned to the nations their  inheritance, When he separated the sons of Adam, He set the  bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children  of Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> He found him in a desert land, And in the waste, howling  wilderness; He compassed him about, he watched over him, He  preserved him as the apple of his eye.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> As the eagle stirreth up its nest, Hovereth over its  young, Spreadeth out its wings, Taketh them, beareth them on  its feathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> So Jehovah alone did lead him, And no strange ùgod [was]  with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he  ate the produce of the field; And he made him suck honey out of  the crag, And oil out of the flinty rock;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Cream of kine, and milk of sheep, With the fat of lambs,  And rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats, With the fat of  kidneys of wheat; And thou didst drink pure wine, the blood of  the grape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> Then Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked -- Thou art waxen fat,  Thou art grown thick, And thou art covered with fatness; -- He  gave up +God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his  salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> They moved him to jealousy with strange gods, With  abominations did they provoke him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> They sacrificed unto demons who are not +God; To gods whom  they knew not, To new ones, who came newly up, Whom your  fathers revered not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> Of the Rock that begot thee wast thou unmindful, And thou  hast forgotten ùGod who brought thee forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> And Jehovah saw it, and despised them, Because of the  provoking of his sons and of his daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see  what their end shall be; For they are a perverse generation,  Children in whom is no faithfulness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is no ùGod;  They have exasperated me with their vanities; And I will move  them to jealousy with that which is not a people; With a  foolish nation will I provoke them to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And it shall burn  into the lowest Sheol, And shall consume the earth and its  produce, And set fire to the foundations of the mountains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> I will heap mischiefs upon them; Mine arrows will I spend  against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> They shall be consumed with hunger, and devoured with  burning heat, And with poisonous pestilence; And the teeth of  beasts will I send against them, With the poison of what  crawleth in the dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> From without shall the sword bereave them, and in the  chambers, terror -- Both the young man and the virgin, The  suckling with the man of gray hairs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> I would say, I will scatter, I will make the remembrance  of them to cease from among men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> If I did not fear provocation from the enemy, Lest their  adversaries should misunderstand it, Lest they should say, Our  hand is high, and Jehovah has not done all this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> For they are a nation void of counsel, And understanding  is not in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> Oh that they had been wise! they would have understood  this, They would have considered their latter end!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand  to flight, Were it not that their Rock had sold them, And  Jehovah had delivered them up?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> For their rock is not as our Rock: Let our enemies  themselves be judges.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields  of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of poison, Bitter are  their clusters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> Their wine is the poison of dragons, And the cruel venom  of vipers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> Is not this hidden with me, Sealed up among my treasures?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> Vengeance is mine, and recompense, For the time when their  foot shall slip. For the day of their calamity is at hand, And  the things that shall come upon them make haste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> For Jehovah will judge his people, And shall repent in  favour of his servants; When he seeth that power is gone, And  there is none shut up or left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> And he shall say, Where are their gods, Their rock in whom  they trusted,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine  of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, That  there may be a protection over you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> See now that I, I am HE, And there is no god with me; I  kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal, And there is none  that delivereth out of my hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> For I lift up my hand to the heavens, and say, I live for  ever!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> If I have sharpened my gleaming sword, And my hand take  hold of judgment, I will render vengeance to mine adversaries,  And will recompense them that hate me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> Mine arrows will I make drunk with blood, And my sword  shall devour flesh; [I will make them drunk] with the blood of  the slain and of the captives, With the head of the princes of  the enemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:43">32:43</a> Shout for joy, ye nations, with his people, For he  avengeth the blood of his servants, And rendereth vengeance to  his enemies, And maketh atonement for his land, for his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:44">32:44</a> And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the  ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:45">32:45</a> And when Moses had ended speaking all these words to all  Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:46">32:46</a> he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words that  I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your  children to take heed to do, all the words of this law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:47">32:47</a> For it is no vain word for you, but it is your life, and  through this word ye shall prolong your days on the land  whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:48">32:48</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:49">32:49</a> Go up into this mountain Abarim, mount Nebo, which is in  the land of Moab, which is opposite Jericho; and behold the  land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a  possession,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:50">32:50</a> and die on the mountain whither thou goest up, and be  gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother died on mount  Hor, and was gathered unto his peoples;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:51">32:51</a> because ye trespassed against me among the children of  Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of  Zin; because ye hallowed me not in the midst of the children of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:52">32:52</a> For thou shalt see the land before [thee]; but thou shalt  not go thither unto the land which I give the children of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God  blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> And he said, Jehovah came from Sinai, And rose up from Seir  unto them; He shone forth from mount Paran, And he came from  the myriads of the sanctuary; From his right hand [went forth]  a law of fire for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> Yea, he loveth the peoples, All his saints are in thy hand,  And they sit down at thy feet; Each receiveth of thy words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> Moses commanded us a law, The inheritance of the  congregation of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> And he was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people  And the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> Let Reuben live, and not die; And let his men be few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And this of Judah; and he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of  Judah, And bring him unto his people; May his hands strive for  them; And be thou a help to him against his oppressors.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy  godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou  didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> Who said to his father and to his mother, I see him not,  And he acknowledged not his brethren, And knew not his own  children; For they have observed thy word, And kept thy  covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy  law: They shall put incense before thy nostrils, And whole  burnt-offering upon thine altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> Bless, Jehovah, his substance! And let the work of his  hands please thee; Crush the loins of his adversaries, And of  them that hate him, that they may never rise again!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah, -- he shall  dwell in safety by him; He will cover him all the day long, And  dwell between his shoulders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land! By  the precious things of the heavens, By the dew, and by the deep  that lieth beneath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> And by the precious fruits of the sun, And by the precious  things put forth by the months,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And by the best things of the ancient mountains, And by  the precious things of the everlasting hills,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> And by the precious things of the earth and the fulness  thereof. And let the good will of him that dwelt in the bush  Come upon the head of Joseph, Upon the top of the head of him  that was separated from his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> His majesty is as the firstling of his ox; And his horns  are as the horns of a buffalo. With them shall he push the  peoples Together to the ends of the earth. These are the  myriads of Ephraim, And these are the thousands of Manasseh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going  out; And thou, Issachar, in thy tents!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> They shall invite [the] peoples to the mountain; There  they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; For they will  suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the  sand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad! As a  lion doth he dwell, and teareth the arm, even the top of the  head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> And he provided the first part for himself, For there was  reserved the portion of the lawgiver; And he came with the  heads of the people; The justice of Jehovah and his judgments  Hath he executed with Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> And of Dan he said, Dan is a young lion; He shall spring  forth from Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> And of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favour,  And full of the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and  the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> And of Asher he said, Asher shall be blessed with sons;  Let him be acceptable to his brethren, And let him dip his foot  in oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> Iron and brass shall be thy bolts; And thy rest as thy  days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:26">33:26</a> There is none like unto the ùGod of Jeshurun, Who rideth  upon the heavens to thy help, And in his majesty, upon the  clouds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:27">33:27</a> [Thy] refuge is the God of old, And underneath are the  eternal arms; And he shall drive out the enemy from before  thee, And shall say, Destroy [them]!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:28">33:28</a> And Israel shall dwell in safety alone, The fountain of  Jacob, in a land of corn and new wine; Also his heavens shall  drop down dew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:29">33:29</a> Happy art thou, Israel! Who is like unto thee, a people  saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of  thine excellency? And thine enemies shall come cringing to  thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to  the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And Jehovah  shewed him the whole land, Gilead to Dan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh,  and all the land of Judah, unto the hindmost sea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the  city of palm-trees, to Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land that I swore  unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed  will I give it: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes,  but thou shalt not go over thither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> And Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of  Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab,  opposite Beth-Peor; and no man knows his sepulchre to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died;  his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of  Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping and mourning for  Moses were ended.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of  wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children  of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> And there arose no prophet since in Israel like Moses,  whom Jehovah had known face to face;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> according to all the signs and wonders that Jehovah had  sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his  servants, and to all his land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> and according to all that mighty hand; and according to  all the great terribleness that Moses had wrought in the sight  of all Israel.</p>
