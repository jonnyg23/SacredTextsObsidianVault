  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 2 Thessalonians</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of  Thessalonians in God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, even as it  is meet, because your faith increases exceedingly, and the love  of each one of you all towards one another abounds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the assemblies  of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions  and tribulations, which ye are sustaining;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, to the  end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for  the sake of which ye also suffer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> if at least [it is a] righteous thing with God to render  tribulation to those that trouble you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and to you that are troubled repose with us, at the  revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with [the] angels of  his power,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God,  and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus  Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> who shall pay the penalty [of] everlasting destruction from  [the] presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and  wondered at in all that have believed, (for our testimony to  you has been believed,) in that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may  count you worthy of the calling, and fulfil all [the] good  pleasure of [his] goodness and [the] work of faith with power,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> so that the name of our Lord Jesus [Christ] may be  glorified in you and *ye* in him, according to the grace of our  God, and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus  Christ and our gathering together to him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by  spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as [if it were] by us, as  that the day of the Lord is present.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because [it will  not be] unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin  have been revealed, the son of perdition;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called  God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in  the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, I said these  things to you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be  revealed in his own time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only [there  is] he who restrains now until he be gone,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord  Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall  annul by the appearing of his coming;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all  power and signs and wonders of falsehood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish,  because they have not received the love of the truth that they  might be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And for this reason God sends to them a working of error,  that they should believe what is false,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> that all might be judged who have not believed the truth,  but have found pleasure in unrighteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren  beloved of [the] Lord, that God has chosen you from [the]  beginning to salvation in sanctification of [the] Spirit and  belief of [the] truth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> whereto he has called you by our glad tidings, to [the]  obtaining of [the] glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the  instructions which ye have been taught, whether by word or by  our letter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father,  who has loved us, and given [us] eternal consolation and good  hope by grace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work  and word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the  Lord may run and be glorified, even as also with you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and that we may be delivered from bad and evil men, for  faith [is] not [the portion] of all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and keep  [you] from evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> But we trust in the Lord as to you, that the things which we  enjoin, ye both do and will do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> But the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and  into the patience of the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> Now we enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus  Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly  and not according to the instruction which he received from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us, because  we have not walked disorderly among you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost; but in  toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to  any one of you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> not that we have not the right, but that we might give  ourselves as an example to you, in order to your imitating us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> For also when we were with you we enjoined you this, that  if any man does not like to work, neither let him eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> For we hear that [there are] some walking among you  disorderly, not working at all, but busybodies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Now such we enjoin and exhort in [the] Lord Jesus Christ,  that working quietly they eat their own bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> But *ye*, brethren, do not faint in well-doing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> But if any one obey not our word by the letter, mark that  man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed  of himself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a  brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> But the Lord of peace himself give you peace continually in  every way. The Lord [be] with you all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is [the] mark  in every letter; so I write.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.</p>
