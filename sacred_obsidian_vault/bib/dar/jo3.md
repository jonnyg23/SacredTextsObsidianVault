  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 3 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Beloved, I desire that in all things thou shouldest prosper  and be in health, even as thy soul prospers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> For I rejoiced exceedingly when [the] brethren came and bore  testimony to thy [holding fast the] truth, even as *thou*  walkest in truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I have no greater joy than these things that I hear of my  children walking in the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Beloved, thou doest faithfully [in] whatever thou mayest  have wrought towards the brethren and that strangers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> (who have witnessed of thy love before [the] assembly,) in  setting forward whom on their journey worthily of God, thou  wilt do well;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> for for the name have they gone forth, taking nothing of  those of the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> *We* therefore ought to receive such, that we may be  fellow-workers with the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> I wrote something to the assembly; but Diotrephes, who loves  to have the first place among them, receives us not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his  works which he does, babbling against us with wicked words; and  not content with these, neither does he himself receive the  brethren; and those who would he prevents, and casts [them] out  of the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He  that does good is of God. He that does evil has not seen God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Demetrius has witness borne to him by all, and by the truth  itself; and *we* also bear witness, and thou knowest that our  witness is true.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> I had many things to write to thee, but I will not with ink  and pen write to thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> but I hope soon to see thee, and we will speak mouth to  mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Peace [be] to thee. The friends greet thee. Greet the  friends by name.</p>
