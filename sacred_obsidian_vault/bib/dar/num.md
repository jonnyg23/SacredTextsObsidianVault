 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they  set forward out of the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses  said, Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; And  let them that hate thee flee before thy face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> And when it rested, he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the  myriads of the thousands of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And it came to pass that when the people murmured, it was  evil in the ears of Jehovah; and Jehovah heard it, and his  anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them,  and consumed [some] in the extremity of the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah  -- and the fire abated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And they called the name of that place Taberah; because a  fire of Jehovah burned among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted; and the  children of Israel also wept again and said, Who will give us  flesh to eat?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the  cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and  the garlic;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> and now our soul is dried up: there is nothing at all but  the manna before our eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And the manna was as coriander seed, and its appearance as  the appearance of bdellium.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it with  hand-mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and  made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of  oil-cakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And when the dew fell upon the camp by night, the manna  fell upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,  every one at the entrance of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah  was kindled greatly; it was also evil in the eyes of Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And Moses said to Jehovah, Why hast thou done evil to thy  servant, and why have I not found favour in thine eyes, that  thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> Have I conceived all this people, have I brought them  forth, that thou sayest to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as the  nursing-father beareth the suckling, unto the land which thou  didst swear unto their fathers?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people?  for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> I am not able to bear all this people alone, for it is too  heavy for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And if thou deal thus with me, slay me, I pray thee, if I  have found favour in thine eyes, that I may not behold my  wretchedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of  the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the  people, and their officers; and take them to the tent of  meeting, and they shall stand there with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will  take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon  them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee,  and thou shalt not bear it alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And unto the people shalt thou say, Hallow yourselves for  to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears  of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? for it was  well with us in Egypt; and Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye  shall eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, nor five days,  neither ten days, nor twenty days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> [but] for a whole month, until it come out at your  nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye  have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before  him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And Moses said, The people in whose midst I am are six  hundred thousand footmen; and thou sayest, I will give them  flesh that they may eat a whole month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice  them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to  suffice them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Hath Jehovah's hand become  short? Now shalt thou see whether my word will come to pass  unto thee or not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> And Moses went out and told the people the words of  Jehovah; and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the  people, and set them round about the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And Jehovah came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and  took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the  seventy men, the elders; and it came to pass, that when the  Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not repeat  [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> And two men remained in the camp, the name of the one,  Eldad, and the name of the other, Medad; and the Spirit rested  upon them (and they were among them that were written, but they  had not gone out to the tent); and they prophesied in the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> And there ran a youth, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and  Medad are prophesying in the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of  his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? would  that all Jehovah's people were prophets, [and] that Jehovah  would put his Spirit upon them!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and drove quails  from the sea, and cast them about the camp, about a day's  journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other  side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> And the people rose up all that day, and the whole night,  and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that  gathered little gathered ten homers; and they spread them  abroad for themselves round about the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:33">11:33</a> The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was  chewed, when the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the  people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:34">11:34</a> And they called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah;  because there they buried the people who lusted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:35">11:35</a> From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth;  and they were at Hazeroth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the  Ethiopian woman whom he had taken; for he had taken a Cushite  as wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only to Moses? has  he not spoken also to us? And Jehovah heard it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> But the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were  upon the face of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Then Jehovah spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to  Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they  went out, they three.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood  at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and  they both came forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among  you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I  will speak to him in a dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> Not so my servant Moses: he is faithful in all my house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in  riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold. Why then were  ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and he  went away;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> and the cloud departed from off the tent. And behold,  Miriam was leprous as snow; and Aaron turned toward Miriam, and  behold, she was leprous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> Then Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee,  lay not this sin upon us, wherein we have been foolish, and  have sinned!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> Let her not be as one stillborn, half of whose flesh is  consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, O ùGod, heal her, I  beseech thee!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, But had her father anyways spat  in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? She shall be  shut outside the camp seven days, and afterwards she shall be  received in [again].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days; and the  people did not journey till Miriam was received in [again].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And afterwards the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and  encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> Send thou men, that they may search out the land of Canaan,  which I give unto the children of Israel. Ye shall send a man  of every tribe of his fathers, each a prince among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran: according  to the commandment of Jehovah, all of them heads of the  children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And these are their names: for the tribe of Reuben, Shammua  the son of Zaccur;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> for the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> for the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> for the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> for the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> for the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> for the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> for the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi  the son of Susi;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> for the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> for the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> for the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> for the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to search  out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And Moses sent them to search out the land of Canaan, and  said to them, Go up this way by the south and go up into the  hill-country,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> and ye shall see the land, what it is; and the people that  dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is  good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in,  whether in camps, or in strongholds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether  there are trees in it, or not. And take courage, and bring of  the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first  grapes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And they went up, and searched out the land from the  wilderness of Zin to Rehob, where one comes towards Hamath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And they went up by the south, and came to Hebron; and  Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.  Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> And they came as far as the valley of Eshcol, and cut down  thence a branch with one bunch of grapes, and they bore it  between two upon a pole; and [they brought] of the  pomegranates, and of the figs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the  grapes which the children of Israel had cut down there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And they returned from searching out the land after forty  days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> And they came, and went to Moses and to Aaron, and to the  whole assembly of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of  Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to the  whole assembly; and shewed them the fruit of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> And they told him, and said, We came to the land to which  thou didst send us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;  and this is the fruit of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> Only, the people are strong that dwell in the land, and  the cities are walled, very great; moreover we saw the children  of Anak there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> Amalek dwells in the land of the south; and the Hittites,  and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill-country;  and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the side of the  Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let  us go up boldly and possess it, for we are well able to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to  go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> And they brought to the children of Israel an evil report  of the land which they had searched out, saying, The land,  which we have passed through to search it out, is a land that  eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we have seen  in it are men of great stature;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> and there have we seen giants -- the sons of Anak are of  the giants -- and we were in our sight as grasshoppers, and so  we were also in their sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And the whole assembly lifted up their voice, and cried;  and the people wept that night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and  against Aaron; and the whole assembly said to them, Would that  we had died in the land of Egypt! or in this wilderness would  that we had died!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And why is Jehovah bringing us to this land that we may  fall by the sword, that our wives and our little ones may  become a prey? Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and  let us return to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> Then Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces before the whole  congregation of the assembly of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,  of them that searched out the land, rent their garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of  Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it  out, is a very, very good land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land,  and give it us, a land that flows with milk and honey;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> only rebel not against Jehovah; and fear not the people of  the land; for they shall be our food. Their defence is departed  from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And the whole assembly said that they should be stoned  with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of  meeting to all the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people  despise me? and how long will they not believe me, for all the  signs which I have done among them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> I will smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them,  and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear  it; for in thy might thou broughtest up this people from the  midst of them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land,  [who] have heard that thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this  people, that thou, Jehovah, lettest thyself be seen eye to eye,  and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest  before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of  fire by night;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> if thou now slayest this people as one man, then the  nations that have heard thy fame will speak, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the  land that he had sworn unto them, he has therefore slain them  in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And now, I beseech thee, let the power of the Lord be  great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in goodness,  forgiving iniquity and transgression, but by no means clearing  [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the  children, upon the third and fourth [generation].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people  according to the greatness of thy loving-kindness, and as thou  hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> But as surely as I live, all the earth shall be filled  with the glory of Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> for all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs,  which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me  these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> shall in no wise see the land which I did swear unto their  fathers: none of them that despised me shall see it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> But my servant Caleb, because he hath another spirit in  him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land  whereinto he came; and his seed shall possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the  valley.) To-morrow turn you, and take your journey into the  wilderness, on the way to the Red sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> How long [shall I bear] with this evil assembly, which  murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children  of Israel, which they murmur against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> Say unto them, As surely as I live, saith Jehovah, if I do  not do unto you as ye have spoken in mine ears!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> In this wilderness shall your carcases fall; and all that  were numbered of you, according to your whole number from  twenty years old and upwards, who have murmured against me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> shall in no wise come into the land, concerning which I  have lifted up my hand to make you dwell in it; save Caleb the  son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> But your little ones, of whom ye said they should be a  prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land that  ye have despised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:32">14:32</a> And as to you, your carcases shall fall in this  wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:33">14:33</a> And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty  years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted  in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:34">14:34</a> After the number of the days in which ye have searched out  the land, forty days, each day for a year shall ye bear your  iniquities forty years, and ye shall know mine estrangement  [from you].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:35">14:35</a> I Jehovah have spoken; I will surely do it unto all this  evil assembly which have gathered together against me! in this  wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:36">14:36</a> And the men whom Moses had sent to search out the land,  who returned, and made the whole assembly to murmur against  him, by bringing up an evil report upon the land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:37">14:37</a> even those men who had brought up an evil report upon the  land, died by a plague before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:38">14:38</a> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,  lived still of the men that had gone to search out the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:39">14:39</a> And Moses told all these sayings to all the children of  Israel; then the people mourned greatly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:40">14:40</a> And they rose up early in the morning, and went up to the  hill-top, saying, Here are we, and we will go up to the place  of which Jehovah has spoken; for we have sinned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:41">14:41</a> And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment  of Jehovah? but it shall not prosper!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:42">14:42</a> Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not  smitten before your enemies;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:43">14:43</a> for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before  you, and ye shall fall by the sword; for as ye have turned away  from Jehovah, Jehovah will not be with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:44">14:44</a> Yet they presumed to go up to the hill-top; but the ark of  the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, did not depart from the  midst of the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:45">14:45</a> And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt on that  hill, came down and smote them, and cut them to pieces, as far  as Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> then shall he that presenteth his offering to Jehovah bring  as oblation a tenth part of fine flour mingled with a fourth  part of a hin of oil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> and of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou offer the  fourth part of a hin with the burnt-offering, or with the  sacrifice, for one lamb.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> then it shall be, if ought be committed by inadvertence  [hid] from the eyes of the assembly, that the whole assembly  shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet  odour to Jehovah, and its oblation and its drink-offering  according to the ordinance, and one buck of the goats for a  sin-offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> And the priest shall make atonement for the whole assembly  of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for  it was a sin of inadvertence, and they have brought before  Jehovah their offering, as an offering by fire to Jehovah, and  their sin-offering for their [sin of] inadvertence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> and it shall be forgiven the whole assembly of the  children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among  them; for with all the people there was [a sin of]  inadvertence.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:32">15:32</a> And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness  they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:33">15:33</a> And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to  Moses and Aaron, and to the whole assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:34">15:34</a> And they put him in custody, for it was not declared what  should be done to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:35">15:35</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall certainly be put  to death: the whole assembly shall stone him with stones  outside the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:36">15:36</a> And the whole assembly led him outside the camp, and  stoned him with stones, and he died, as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:40">15:40</a> that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be  holy unto your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:41">15:41</a> I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of  Egypt to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of  Levi, made bold, and [with him] Dathan and Abiram, the sons of  Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, the sons of Reuben;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> and they rose up against Moses, with two hundred and fifty  men of the children of Israel, princes of the assembly,  summoned to the council, men of renown;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> and they gathered themselves together against Moses and  against Aaron, and said to them, It is enough; for all the  assembly, all of them are holy, and Jehovah is among them; and  why do ye lift up yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And he spoke to Korah and to all his band, saying, Even  to-morrow will Jehovah make known who is his, and who is holy;  and he will cause him to come near to him; and him whom he has  chosen, him will he cause to come near to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his band,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> and put fire therein, and lay incense thereon before  Jehovah to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah  doth choose, he shall be holy. It is enough, ye sons of Levi!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> Is it too little for you, that the God of Israel has  separated you from the assembly of Israel, to bring you near to  himself to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to  stand before the assembly to minister to them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> -- that he has brought thee near, and all thy brethren the  sons of Levi with thee; and seek ye now the priesthood also?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> For which cause thou and all thy band are banded together  against Jehovah; and Aaron, who is he that ye murmur against  him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of  Eliab; but they said, We will not come up!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a  land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,  that thou must make thyself altogether a ruler over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land flowing  with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and  vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not  come up!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> Then Moses was very wroth, and said to Jehovah, Have no  regard to their oblation: not one ass have I taken from them,  neither have I hurt one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy band before  Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And take each his censer, and put incense thereon, and  present before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and  fifty censers; and thou, and Aaron, each his censer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And they took each his censer, and put fire on them, and  laid incense thereon, and stood before the entrance to the tent  of meeting, as well as Moses and Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And Korah gathered the whole assembly against them to the  entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Jehovah  appeared to all the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I  will consume them in a moment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And they fell on their faces, and said, O ùGod, the God of  the spirits of all flesh! shall *one* man sin, and wilt thou be  wroth with the whole assembly?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> Speak unto the assembly, saying, Get you up from about the  habitation of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the  elders of Israel followed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> And he spoke to the assembly, saying, Depart, I pray you,  from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of  theirs, lest ye perish in all their sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> And they got up from the habitation of Koran, Dathan, and  Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and  stood in the entrance of their tents, and their wives, and  their sons, and their little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah has sent  me to do all these deeds, for they are not out of my own heart:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> if these men die as all men die, and are visited with the  visitation of all men, Jehovah has not sent me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> but if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its  mouth, and swallow them up, and all that they have, and they go  down alive into Sheol, then ye shall know that these men have  despised Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> And it came to pass when he had ended speaking all these  words, that the ground clave apart that was under them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> And the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and  their households, and all the men that belonged to Korah, and  all their property.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> And they went down, they and all that they had, alive into  Sheol, and the earth covered them; and they perished from among  the congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> And all Israel that were round about them fled at their  cry; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> And there came out a fire from Jehovah, and consumed the  two hundred and fifty men that had presented incense.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:37">16:37</a> Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take  up the censers out of the burning; and scatter the fire afar;  for they are hallowed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> the censers of these sinners who have forfeited their  life; and they shall make them into broad plates for the  covering of the altar; for they presented them before Jehovah,  therefore they are hallowed; and they shall be a sign unto the  children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> And Eleazar the priest took the copper censers, which they  that were burnt had presented; and they were made broad plates  for a covering of the altar:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> as a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger  who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to burn incense  before Jehovah, that he be not as Korah, and as his band, -- as  Jehovah had said to him through Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:41">16:41</a> And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured  on the morrow against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have  killed the people of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:42">16:42</a> And it came to pass, when the assembly was gathered  together against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked  toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it,  and the glory of Jehovah appeared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:43">16:43</a> And Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:44">16:44</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:45">16:45</a> Get you up from the midst of this assembly, and I will  consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:46">16:46</a> And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer, and put fire  thereon from off the altar, and lay on incense, and carry it  quickly to the assembly, and make atonement for them; for there  is wrath gone out from Jehovah: the plague is begun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:47">16:47</a> And Aaron took as Moses had said, and ran into the midst  of the congregation; and behold, the plague had begun among the  people; and he put on incense, and made atonement for the  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:48">16:48</a> And he stood between the dead and the living; and the  plague was stayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:49">16:49</a> Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand  seven hundred, besides them that had died because of the matter  of Korah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:50">16:50</a> And Aaron returned to Moses to the entrance of the tent of  meeting; and the plague was stayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them a  staff, a staff for each father's house, of all their princes  according to the houses of their fathers, twelve staves: thou  shalt write each one's name upon his staff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And Aaron's name shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi;  for one staff shall be for [each] head of their fathers'  houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before  the testimony, where I meet with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall  choose, his staff shall bud forth; and I will make to cease  from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel, that  they murmur against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their  princes gave him a staff, one staff for each prince according  to their fathers' houses, twelve staves, and the staff of Aaron  was among their staves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And Moses laid the staves before Jehovah in the tent of the  testimony.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And it came to pass, when on the morrow Moses went into the  tent of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house  of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed  blossoms, and ripened almonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And Moses brought out all the staves from before Jehovah to  all the children of Israel, and they looked and took each one  his staff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aaron's staff again  before the testimony, to be kept as a token for the sons of  rebellion, that thou mayest put an end to their murmurings  before me, that they may not die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And Moses did so: as Jehovah had commanded him, so did he.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Lo, we  expire, we perish, we all perish.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered  themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And the people contended with Moses, and spoke, saying,  Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And why have ye brought the congregation of Jehovah into  this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to  the entrance of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces;  and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, and  Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their  eyes, and it shall give its water; and thou shalt bring forth  to them water out of the rock, and shalt give the assembly and  their beasts drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah, as he had  commanded him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together  before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels:  shall we bring forth to you water out of this rock?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his staff smote the  rock twice, and much water came out, and the assembly drank,  and their beasts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Because ye  believed me not, to hallow me before the eyes of the children  of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into  the land that I have given them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of  Israel contended with Jehovah, and he hallowed himself in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom,  Thus says thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the trouble that  hath befallen us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt  a long time, and the Egyptians evil entreated us and our  fathers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> and when we cried to Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent  an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and behold, we are  at Kadesh, a city at the extremity of thy border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not  pass through fields, or through vineyards, neither will we  drink water out of the wells: we will go by the king's road; we  will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have  passed thy border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> But Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I  come out against thee with the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the  high way; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then I  will pay for it: I will only, without anything else, go through  on my feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out  against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his  territory; and Israel turned away from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And they removed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel,  the whole assembly, came to mount Hor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron in mount Hor, on  the border of the land of Edom, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> Aaron shall be gathered unto his peoples; for he shall not  enter into the land that I have given unto the children of  Israel, because ye rebelled against my commandment at the  waters of Meribah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto  mount Hor,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar  his son; and Aaron shall be gathered [to his peoples], and  shall die there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded, and they went up  mount Hor before the eyes of the whole assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them  upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there upon the top of the  mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> And the whole assembly saw that Aaron was dead, and they  mourned for Aaron thirty days, [even] the whole house of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And the Canaanite king of Arad, who dwelt in the south,  heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim, and he fought  against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> Then Israel vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou give  this people wholly into my hand, then I will utterly destroy  their cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered  up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them, and their  cities. And they called the name of the place Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red  sea, to go round the land of Edom; and the soul of the people  became impatient on the way;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> and the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why  have ye brought us up out of Egypt that we should die in the  wilderness? for there is no bread, and no water, and our soul  loathes this light bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, which  bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, in  that we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee: pray to  Jehovah that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses  prayed for the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Make thee a fiery [serpent], and  set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one  that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole;  and it came to pass, if a serpent had bitten any man, and he  beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in  Oboth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And they removed from Oboth, and encamped at Ijim-Abarim,  in the wilderness that is before Moab, toward the sun-rising.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> From thence they removed, and encamped at the torrent  Zered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> From thence they removed, and encamped on the other side  of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the  border of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the border of Moab,  between Moab and the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of Jehovah,  Vaheb in Suphah, and the brooks of Arnon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And the stream of the brooks which turneth to the dwelling  of Ar, And inclineth toward the border of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And from thence to Beer: that is the well of which Jehovah  spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them  water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> Then Israel sang this song, Rise up, well! sing unto it:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> Well which princes digged, which the nobles of the people  hollowed out at [the word of] the lawgiver, with their staves.  And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to  Bamoth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the fields of  Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks over the surface of the  waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> Let us pass through thy land; we will not turn into the  fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink water out of  the wells; on the king's road will we go until we have passed  thy border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> But Sihon would not suffer Israel to go through his  border; and Sihon gathered all his people, and went out against  Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and fought  against Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took  possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even unto  the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon  was strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all  the cities of the Amorites, at Heshbon, and in all its  dependent villages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the  Amorites; and he had fought against the former king of Moab,  and had taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the  Arnon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> Therefore the poets say, Come to Heshbon; let the city of  Sihon be built and established.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> For there went forth fire from Heshbon, a flame from the  city of Sihon; It consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high  places of the Arnon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, people of Chemosh: He  gave his sons that had escaped, and his daughters into  captivity to Sihon the king of the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> And we have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto  Dibon; and we have laid [them] waste even unto Nophah, which  reacheth unto Medeba.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> And Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its  dependent villages, and he dispossessed the Amorites that were  there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og  the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his  people, for battle to Edrei.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Fear him not! for into thy hand  have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou  shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the  Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:35">21:35</a> And they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, so  that they left him none remaining, and took possession of his  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the  plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan from Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to  the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> And Moab was much afraid of the people, because they were  many; and Moab was distressed because of the children of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now will this  company lick up all that is round about us, as an ox licks up  the green herb of the field. Now Balak the son of Zippor was  king of Moab at that time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to  Pethor, which is on the river in the land of the children of  his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is come out  from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the land, and they  abide over against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> And now come, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they  are mightier than I: perhaps I may be able to smite them, and  drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou  blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed,  having the rewards of divination in their hand. And they came  to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will  bring you word again, according as Jehovah shall speak unto me.  And the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And God came to Balaam, and said, Who are these men with  thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of  Moab, hath sent unto me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and it covers the  face of the land. Now come, curse me them: perhaps I may be  able to fight against them, and drive them out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou  shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes  of Balak, Go into your land; for Jehovah refuses to give me  leave to go with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And the princes of Moab rose up; and they went to Balak,  and said, Balaam has refused to come with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> Then sent Balak yet again princes, more, and more  honourable than they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak  the son of Zippor: Suffer not thyself, I pray thee, to be  restrained from coming to me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> for very highly will I honour thee, and whatever thou  shalt say to me will I do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse  me this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If  Balak give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go  beyond the commandment of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> And now, I pray you, abide ye also here this night, and I  shall know what Jehovah will say to me further.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> Then God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the  men have come to call thee, rise up, [and] go with them; but  only what I shall say unto thee shalt thou do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass,  and went with the princes of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the Angel  of Jehovah set himself in the way to withstand him. Now he was  riding upon his ass, and his two young men were with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way,  and his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out  of the way, and went into the field, and Balaam smote the ass  to turn her into the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a hollow of the  vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and she pressed  herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the  wall; and he smote her again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> Then the Angel of Jehovah went still further, and stood in  a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right  hand or to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and lay down under  Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass  with his staff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to  Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me  these three times?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I  would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which  thou hast ridden ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever  wont to do so to thee? And he said, No.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the  Angel of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in  his hand; and he bowed and prostrated himself on his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Wherefore hast thou  smitten thine ass these three times? behold, it was I who came  forth to withstand thee, for the way [thou walkest in] is for  ruin before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times;  had she not turned from me, I had now certainly slain thee, and  saved her alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned;  for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; and  now, if it be evil in thine eyes, I will get me back again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:35">22:35</a> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men,  but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou  speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:36">22:36</a> And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet  him, to the city of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon,  which is at the extremity of the border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:37">22:37</a> And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee  to call thee? why didst thou not come to me? am I not surely  able to honour thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:38">22:38</a> And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I am come to thee; but shall  I now be able at all to say anything? the word that God puts in  my mouth, that shall I speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:39">22:39</a> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to  Kirjath-huzoth.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:41">22:41</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam,  and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from  thence the extremity of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and  prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> And Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam  offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and  I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever  he shews me I will tell thee. And he went to a hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And God met Balaam; and [Balaam] said to him, I have  disposed seven altars, and have offered up a bullock and a ram  upon [each] altar.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> And he returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his  burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of  Moab hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east:  Come, curse me Jacob, and come, denounce Israel!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> How shall I curse whom ùGod hath not cursed? or how shall I  denounce whom Jehovah doth not denounce?</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the  fourth part of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the  righteous, and let my end be like his!</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And he took him to the watchmen's field, to the top of  Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a  ram on [each] altar.</p>

 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell  thee, saying, All that Jehovah shall speak, that will I do?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring  thee to another place; perhaps it will be right in the sight of  God that thou curse me them from thence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks  over the surface of the waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and  prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock  and a ram on each altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And Balaam saw that it was good in the sight of Jehovah to  bless Israel, and he went not, as at other times, to seek for  enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling [in  tents] according to his tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of  Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> He saith, who heareth the words of ùGod, who seeth the  vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes  open:</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> Like valleys are they spread forth, like gardens by the  river side, Like aloe-trees which Jehovah hath planted, like  cedars beside the waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> Water shall flow out of his buckets, and his seed shall be  in great waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, and  his kingdom shall be exalted.</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he  smote his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called  thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether  blessed [them] these three times!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> And now flee thou to thy place; I said I would very highly  honour thee, and behold, Jehovah has kept thee back from  honour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy  messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> If Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I  could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah to do good or  bad out of my heart: what Jehovah shall say, that will I speak?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And now behold, I go to my people: come, I will admonish  thee what this people will do to thy people at the end of days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of  Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> He saith, who heareth the words of ùGod, who knoweth the  knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the  Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not  nigh: There cometh a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall  rise out of Israel, and he shall cut in pieces the corners of  Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And Edom shall be a possession, and Seir a possession, --  they, his enemies; but Israel will do valiantly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And one out of Jacob shall have dominion, and will destroy  out of the city what remaineth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> And he saw Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,  Amalek is the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be  for destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And he saw the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,  Firm is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest fixed in the rock;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> But the Kenite shall be consumed, until Asshur shall carry  thee away captive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Alas! Who shall live  when ùGod doeth this?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and  afflict Asshur, and afflict Eber, and he also shall be for  destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place;  and Balak also went his way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to commit  fornication with the daughters of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their  gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> And Israel joined himself to Baal-Peor; and the anger of  Jehovah was kindled against Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the heads of the  people, and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun, that the  fierce anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay every one his  men that have joined themselves to Baal-Peor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And behold, a man of the children of Israel came and  brought a Midianitish woman to his brethren, in the sight of  Moses, and in the sight of the whole assembly of the children  of Israel, who were weeping before the entrance of the tent of  meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the  priest, saw it, and rose up from among the assembly, and took a  javelin in his hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> and he went after the man of Israel into the tent-chamber,  and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the  woman through her belly. And the plague was stayed from the  children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> And those that died in the plague were twenty-four  thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,  hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that  he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed  not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> Therefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of  peace!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And he shall have it, and his seed after him, the covenant  of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his  God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> And the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was  slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,  the prince of a father's house of the Simeonites.</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> Harass the Midianites, and smite them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> for they have harassed you with their wiles, wherewith  they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter  of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who  was slain on the day of the plague because of the matter of  Peor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spoke to  Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> Take the sum of the whole assembly of the children of  Israel, from twenty years old and upward, according to their  fathers' houses, all that go forth to military service in  Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_26:59">26:59</a> And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of  Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram  Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.</p>

 <p><a name="an_26:62">26:62</a> And those that were numbered of the [Levites] were  twenty-three thousand, all males from a month old and upward;  for they were not numbered among the children of Israel,  because there was no inheritance given them among the children  of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:63">26:63</a> These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the  priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of  Moab, by the Jordan of Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:64">26:64</a> But among these there was not a man numbered by Moses and  Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the  wilderness of Sinai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:65">26:65</a> For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the  wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb  the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of  Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of  Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and  these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and  Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,  and before the princes and the whole assembly, at the entrance  of the tent of meeting, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely  give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's  brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father  to pass unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying,  If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his  inheritance to pass unto his daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> And if he have no daughter, ye shall give his inheritance  unto his brethren.</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> And if his father have no brethren, ye shall give his  inheritance to his kinsman that is nearest to him in his  family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be unto the  children of Israel a statute of right, as Jehovah commanded  Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Get thee up into this mount  Abarim, and see the land that I have given unto the children of  Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:15">27:15</a> And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> who may go out before them, and who may come in before  them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in,  that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no  shepherd.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a  man in whom is the Spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon  him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> and thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and  before the whole assembly; and give him commandment before  their eyes.</p>

 <p><a name="an_27:21">27:21</a> And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall  inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at  his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in,  he, and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole  assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took  Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the  whole assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:23">27:23</a> And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him commandment,  as Jehovah had said through Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_31:48">31:48</a> And the officers who were over the thousands of the host,  the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near  to Moses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:49">31:49</a> and they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of  the men of war who were under our hand, and there is not one  man of us lacking.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:50">31:50</a> So we present the offering of Jehovah, that which each one  hath found, jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,  earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:51">31:51</a> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,  all manner of wrought jewels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:52">31:52</a> And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered  to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty  shekels, from the captains of thousands and the captains of  hundreds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:53">31:53</a> (The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:54">31:54</a> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the  captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the  tent of meeting, as a memorial for the children of Israel  before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had much  cattle, a very great multitude; and they saw the land of  Jaazer, and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a  place for cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and  spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes  of the assembly, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jaazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon,  and Elaleh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> the country that Jehovah smote before the assembly of  Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> and they said, If we have found favour in thine eyes, let  this land be given to thy servants for a possession: bring us  not over the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children  of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall *ye* abide  here?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> And why do ye discourage the children of Israel from going  over into the land that Jehovah has given them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea  to see the land:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, and  discouraged the children of Israel, that they should not go  into the land that Jehovah had given them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> And Jehovah's anger was kindled the same time, and he  swore, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> If the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years  old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to Abraham, to  Isaac, and to Jacob! for they have not wholly followed me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua  the son of Nun; for they have wholly followed Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and he  made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole  generation was consumed that had done evil in the eyes of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> And behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, a  progeny of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of  Jehovah toward Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> If ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave  them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And they drew near to him, and said, We will build  sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> but we ourselves will go with diligence armed before the  children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place;  and our little ones shall dwell in the strong cities because of  the inhabitants of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> We will not return to our houses, until the children of  Israel have inherited each one his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> For we will not inherit with them on yonder side the  Jordan, and further, because our inheritance is fallen to us on  this side the Jordan eastward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And Moses said to them, If ye do this thing, if ye arm  yourselves before Jehovah for war,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> and all of you that are armed go over the Jordan before  Jehovah, until he have dispossessed his enemies from before  him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and afterwards ye  return, ye shall be guiltless toward Jehovah and toward Israel,  and this land shall be your possession before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> But if ye do not do so, behold, ye have sinned against  Jehovah, and be sure your sin will find you out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and folds  for your flocks, and do that which has gone out of your mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke  to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> Our little ones, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts  shall be there in the cities of Gilead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> but thy servants will pass over, every one armed for war,  before Jehovah to battle, as my lord says.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and  Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of  the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the  children of Reuben pass with you over the Jordan, every one  armed for battle, before Jehovah, and the land be subdued  before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a  possession;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> but if they do not pass over with you armed, they shall  have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben  answered, saying, As Jehovah has said to thy servants, so will  we do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of  Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance on this side the  Jordan shall be ours.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And Moses gave to them, to the children of Gad, and to the  children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son  of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the  kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, the land, according to its  cities and territories, the cities of the land round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and  Aroer,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> and Atroth-Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbebah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-haran, strong cities, and  sheepfolds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> -- And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elaleh,  and Kirjathaim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> and Nebo, and Baal-meon (of which the names were changed),  and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities that they  built.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> -- And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to  Gilead, and took it, and they dispossessed the Amorites that  were therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and  he dwelt therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their hamlets,  and called them Havoth-Jair.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its dependent  villages, and called it Nobah, after his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went  forth out of the land of Egypt according to their armies under  the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> And Moses wrote their goings out according to their  journeys by the commandment of Jehovah; and these are their  journeys according to their goings out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the  fifteenth day of the first month. On the morrow after the  passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in  the sight of all the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And the Egyptians buried those whom Jehovah had smitten  among them, all the firstborn; and upon their gods Jehovah  executed judgments.</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> then ye shall appoint for yourselves cities: cities of  refuge shall they be for you; that a manslayer may flee  thither, who without intent smiteth a person mortally.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> And ye shall have these cities for refuge from the  avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he have stood before  the assembly in judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> And the cities that ye shall give shall be six cities of  refuge for you.</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:24">35:24</a> then the assembly shall judge between the smiter and the  avenger of blood according to these judgments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:25">35:25</a> and the assembly shall rescue the manslayer out of the  hand of the avenger of blood, and the assembly shall restore  him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled; and he  shall abide in it until the death of the high-priest, who was  anointed with the holy oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a> But if the manslayer shall in any way come outside the  limits of the city of his refuge whither he hath fled,</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:32">35:32</a> And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled  to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell  in the land, until the death of the priest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:33">35:33</a> And ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for  blood, it polluteth the land; and there can be no atonement  made for the land, for the blood that hath been shed therein,  but by the blood of him that shed it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:34">35:34</a> And ye shall not defile the land that ye inhabit, in the  midst whereof I dwell; for I am Jehovah who dwell in the midst  of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And the chief fathers of families of the sons of Gilead,  the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the  sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before  the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land  for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my  lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of  Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> Now if they be married to any of the sons of the [other]  tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance  be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be  added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall  belong; and it shall be taken from the lot of our inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall come,  then shall their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the  tribe to which they shall belong; and their inheritance shall  be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the  word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath  said well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning  the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whom they  please; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> that no inheritance of the children of Israel pass from  tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall  keep to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance among the  tribes of the children of Israel, shall be married to one of  the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of  Israel may possess every one the inheritance of his fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> and the inheritance shall not pass from one tribe to  another tribe; for each of the tribes of the children of Israel  shall keep to his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> Even as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters  of Zelophehad;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the  daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their uncles' sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> To those that were of the families of the sons of Manasseh  the son of Joseph were they married; and their inheritance  remained in the tribe of the family of their father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> These are the commandments and the ordinances which  Jehovah commanded through Moses to the children of Israel, in  the plains of Moab, by the Jordan of Jericho.</p>
