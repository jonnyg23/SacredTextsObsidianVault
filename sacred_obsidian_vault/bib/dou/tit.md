  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Titus</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all men; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</p>
