  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Prayer of Azariah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And they walked in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and thy name is worthy of praise, and glorious for ever: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgments true. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers: for according to truth and judgment, thou hast brought all these things upon us for our sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For we have sinned, and committed iniquity, departing from thee: and we have trespassed in all things: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And we have not hearkened to thy commandments, nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us, that it might go well with us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are unjust, and most wicked, and prevaricators, and to a king unjust, and most wicked beyond all that axe upon the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And now we cannot open our mouths: we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Deliver us not up for ever, we beseech thee, for thy name's sake, and abolish not thy covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of Abraham thy beloved, and Isaac thy servant, and Israel thy holy one: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> To whom thou hast spoken, promising that thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea shore. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> For we, O Lord, are diminished more than any nation, and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Neither is there at this time prince, or leader, or prophet, or holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of firstfruits before thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> That we may find thy mercy: nevertheless in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks, and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day, that it may please thee: for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And now we follow thee with all our heart, and we fear thee, and seek thy face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> Put us not to confusion, but deal. with us according to thy meekness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And deliver us according to thy wonderful works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants, let them be confounded in all thy might, and let their strength be broken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, and glorious over all the world. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Now the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone, and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And it broke forth, and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found near the furnace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his companions into the furnace: and he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind bringing dew, and the fire touched them not at all, nor troubled them, nor did them any harm. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> Then these three as with one mouth praised, and glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of our fathers: and worthy to be praised, and glorified, and exalted above all for ever: and blessed is the holy name of thy glory: and worthy to be praised, and exalted above all in all ages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory: and exceedingly to be praised, and exceeding glorious for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> Blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom, and exceedingly to be praised, and exalted above all for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> Blessed art thou, that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and worthy of praise, and glorious for ever. </p>
