And after that thou shalt be lifted up into the place whither they that were before thee were lifted up, and shalt be there until I remember the world. And then will I bring you and ye shall taste what is death. 2. And Phinees went up and did all that the Lord commanded him. Now in the days when he appointed him to be priest, he anointed him in Silo.

  came to pass that the children of Israel when they kept the passover commanded the children of Benjamin saying: Go up and take wives for yourselves by force.. because we cannot give you our daughters, for we sware in the time of our anger: and it cannot be that a tribe perish out of Israel.

 <p><a name="fn_141"></a><a href="bap62.htm#fr_141">210:2</a> XLVIII. Phinehas identified with Elijah. See the passage quoted from Origen in the Introd., <a href="bap03.htm#page_11">p. 11</a>. In <i>Pirke R. Eliezer</i> the belief is stated twice: c. 29, when Elijah says: "I have been very zealous" (1 Kings 19:10), God says: Thou art always zealous. Thou wast zealous in Shittim. . . . because it is said: Phinehas . . . turned my wrath away, etc. Here also art thou zealous. c. 47. <i>R. Eliezer said</i>--<a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a> He called the name of Phinehas by the name of Elijah . . . He gave him the life of this world and the life of the world to come. In the <i>Quaest. Hebr. in libros Regum</i> it is said of the man of God who came to Eli (1 Sam. 2): <i>Hunc uirum Dei Iudaei Phinees dicunt: quem et Eliam autumant</i>.</p>
