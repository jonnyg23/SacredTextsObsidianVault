And when the people of Israel had been put to flight in the first battle, they said: Let us bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, peradventure it Will fight with us, because in it are the testimonies of the Lord which he ordained unto our fathers in Oreb. 2.

  them, when it was come into the camp, the Lord thundered and said: This time shall be likened unto that which was in the wilderness, when they took the ark without my commandment, and destruction befel them. So also, at this time, shall the people fall, and the ark shall be taken, that I may punish the adversaries of my people because of the ark, and rebuke my people because they have sinned.

  the Philistines went forth to meet the children of Israel, and smote them. And there was there a certain Golia <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">1</font></a>, a Philistine, which came even unto the ark, and Ophni and Phinees the sons of Heli

 <p>and Saul the son of Cis held the ark. And Golia took <i>it</i> with his left hand and slew Ophni and Phinees. 4. But Saul, because he was light on his feet, fled from before him; and he rent his clothes, Sam. </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

And now the testimonies are delivered up unto the enemy, and what can I more say? Behold, Israel is perished from the truth, for the judgements are taken away from him.
