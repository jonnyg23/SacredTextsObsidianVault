 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_28"></a><a href="bap21.htm#fr_28">86:2</a> V. The numbers in this chapter are hopelessly incorrect. The separate items in the text add up to 704,000; the totals in the text to 734,500, omitting the evidently corrupt figure 9000 assigned to Shem and his descendants. The matter is of no importance.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_29"></a><a href="bap21.htm#fr_29">89:1</a> 8. It is part of this verse which is quoted (and that not accurately) by Petrus Comestor. See Introduction, p. 10.</p>
