 <h3 align="CENTER">5. ORIGINAL LANGUAGE.</h3>
 <p>5. The ORIGINAL LANGUAGE of the book, its date, its form and its purpose, must now be discussed.</p>

 <p>Original Language.--The Latin version, in which alone we possess the work, is quite obviously a translation from Greek. The forms of proper names, the occurrence of Greek words which puzzled the translator, <i>ometocea</i>, <i>pammixia</i>, <i>epomis</i>, etc., make this abundantly clear. It is hardly less plain that the Greek was a translation from Hebrew. As Dr. Cohn has pointed out, the whole complexion, and especially the connecting links of the narrative, are strongly Hebraic, and there is a marked absence of the Greek use of particles, or of any attempt to link sentences together save by the bald "et," which occurs an incredible number of times.</p>
 <p><font size="-1">Some statistics may be given: <i>Et factum est</i> occurs at least 33 times; <i>Et tum</i> (usually of the past) 37; <i>Tunc</i> 25; <i>Et nunc</i> (of present or future) 85; <i>In tempore illo</i> 18; <i>In diebus illis</i> (and the like) 10; <i>Et post haec</i>, or <i>postea</i> 30; <i>Ecce</i> 105; <i>Ecce nunc</i> 47; <i>Et ideo</i> 27; <i>Et erit cum</i>, or <i>si</i> 24. Other common links which I have not counted are <i>Et u</i>t (<i>uidit</i>, etc.), <i>Et cum</i>, <i>His dictis</i>, <i>Propterea</i>.</font></p>
 <p>The leading Hebraisms are present: <i>adiicere</i>, or <i>apponere</i> with another verb, meaning "he did so yet again," 9 times at least; the intensive participle and verb (<i>Illuminans illuminaui</i>) 15 times. We have <i>Si</i> introducing a question 4 times; <i>a uiro usque ad mulierem</i> and the like (XXX. 4; XLVII. 10); ad uictoriam, in uictoria (= למנצח, "Utterly"); IX. 3; XII. 6; XLIX. 6.</p>
 <p>Hebraists, among whom I cannot reckon myself, may probably detect the presence of plays upon words, passages written in poetical form (some of which are indeed obvious), and mistranslations. <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>From what has just been said it will be rightly gathered that the literary style of <i>Philo</i> is not its strong point. Indeed, it is exceedingly monotonous, full of repetitions and catchwords. The author's one device for obtaining an "effect" is to string together a number of high-sounding clauses, as he does, for example, in his repeated descriptions of the giving of the Law. As a narrator, he has another trick. An incident is often compared to another in the past (or future) history of Israel, and many times is an episode from that history related in a speech or prayer.</p>
 <p><font size="-1">Some of the recurrent phrases are: <i>I spake of old saying</i> about 25 times; <i>in vain</i>, or <i>not in vain</i> 14; <i>it is better for us to do</i> this <i>than</i> . . . 7; <i>not for our sakes, but for</i> . . . about 5 times; <i>who knoweth whether</i> 4; <i>dost thou not remember</i> 3; <i>To thy seed will I give this land</i> (or the like) 7-9; <i>the covenant which he made</i> 5-8; <i>I know that the people will sin</i> 8-9; <i>God's anger will not endure for ever</i> 10; <i>The Gentiles will say</i> 4-8; <i>I call heaven and earth to witness</i> 4-5; <i>in the last days</i> 4; <i>make straight your ways</i> 5-6; <i>corrupt</i> (your ways, etc.) 18; <i>remember or visit the world</i> 6; <i>be for a testimony</i> 10. Of single words <i>accipere</i> occurs 88 times in the first half of the text; <i>habitare</i>, <i>inhabitare</i> about 80 times in the whole text; <i>iniquitas</i> 33; <i>disponere</i> 37; <i>testamentum</i> 47; <i>ambulare</i> 21; <i>uia</i>, <i>uiae</i> 25; <i>adducere</i> 19; <i>seducere</i> 21; <i>saeculum</i> 27; <i>sempiternus</i> 15; <i>constituere</i> 20; <i>expugnare</i> 27; <i>zelari</i> 14; <i>illuminare</i> 12; <i>renunciare</i> 15.</font></p>
 <p>Other lists are given in Appendix II.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_9"></a><a href="bap05.htm#fr_9">27:1</a> Pitra thought that the Latin versions of these were by the same hand: I cannot confirm this idea, and indeed incline to question its correctness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_10"></a><a href="bap06.htm#fr_10">28:1</a> Of mistranslations I can only point to one. In VIII. 13 Visui appears as a proper name. It seems clearly to be a mistake for "and Isui." The error implies a Hebrew original: it is not found in the LXX. See the Appendix on Readings <i>in loc</i>.</p>
