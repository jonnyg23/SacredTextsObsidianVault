 <h3 align="CENTER">9. UNITY. CONTENTS.</h3>
 <p>9. I have not raised the question of the UNITY of the book. No one has as yet suggested that it is composite, and I am content to wait until, a theory is broached. That there are inconsistencies in it I do not deny (for instance, the story of Korah is told in two ways in XVI. and in LVII.), but they are not of a kind that suggest a plurality of writers. It may be that their presence here will furnish an argument against dissection of other books based on the existence of similar discrepancies.</p>
 <p>As to the INTEGRITY of the text: We know that it is imperfect, and this matter will be discussed at a later stage.</p>
 <p>The CONTENTS will be found summarized in a synopsis at the end of the Introduction.</p>
