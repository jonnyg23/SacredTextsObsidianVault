  forty-fourth jubilee Jacob sent his sons to pasture their sheep, and his servants with them, to the pastures of Shechem. 2. <a name="fr_771"></a><a href="#fn_767"><font size="1">2</font></a> And the seven kings of the Amorites assembled themselves together against them, to slay them, hiding themselves under the trees, and to take their cattle as a prey. 3. And Jacob and Levi and Judah and Joseph were in the house with Isaac their father; for his spirit was sorrowful, and they could not leave him: and Benjamin was the youngest, and for this reason remained with his father. 4. And there came the king[s] <a name="fr_772"></a><a href="#fn_768"><font size="1">3</font></a> of Tâphû, <a name="fr_773"></a><a href="#fn_769"><font size="1">4</font></a>

And he arose from his housel he and his three sons and all the servants of his father, and his own servants, and he went against them with six thousand <a name="fr_784"></a><a href="#fn_777"><font size="1">8</font></a> men, who carried swords. 7.

 <p>they sold him to Ishmaelite merchants, and they brought him down into Egypt, and they sold him to Potiphar, the eunuch <a name="fr_789"></a><a href="#fn_782"><font size="1">1</font></a> of Pharaoh, the chief of the cooks, <a name="fr_790"></a><a href="#fn_783"><font size="1">2</font></a> priest of the city of Êlêw. <a name="fr_791"></a><a href="#fn_784"><font size="1">3</font></a> 12. And the sons of Jacob slaughtered a kid, and dipped the coat of Joseph in the blood, and sent (it) to Jacob their father on the tenth of the seventh month. 13. And he mourned all that night, for they had brought it to him in the evening, and he became feverish with mourning for his death, and he said: "An evil beast hath devoured Joseph"; and all the members of his house [mourned with him that day, and they] <a name="fr_792"></a><a href="#fn_785"><font size="1">4</font></a> were grieving and mourning with him all that day. 14. And his sons and his daughter rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted for his son. 15. And on that day Bilhah heard that Joseph had perished, and she died mourning him, and she was living in †Qafrâtêf† <a name="fr_793"></a><a href="#fn_786"><font size="1">5</font></a> and Dinah also, his daughter, died after Joseph had perished. And there came these three mournings upon Israel in one month. 16. And they buried Bilhah over against the tomb of Rachel, and Dinah also, his daughter, they buried there. 17. And he mourned for Joseph one year, and did not cease, for he said "Let me go down to the grave mourning for my son." <a name="fr_794"></a><a href="#fn_787"><font size="1">6</font></a> 18. For this reason <a name="fr_795"></a><a href="#fn_788"><font size="1">7</font></a> it is ordained for the children of Israel that they should afflict themselves <a name="fr_796"></a><a href="#fn_789"><font size="1">8</font></a> on the tenth of the seventh month--on the day that the news which made him weep for Joseph came to Jacob his father--that they should make atonement for themselves thereon with a young goat on the tenth of the seventh month,</p>

 <p>once a year, for their sins; for they had grieved the affection of their father regarding Joseph his son. 19. And this day hath been ordained that they should grieve thereon for their sins, and for all their transgressions and for all their errors, so that they might cleanse themselves on that day once a year.</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_767"></a><a href="jub68.htm#fr_771">169:2</a> The account given in 2-8 of the conquest of Shechem is given in a fuller form in the <i>Test. Judah</i> iii-vii., and in the Midrash Wajjissau (cf. Gaster, <i>Chronicles of Jerahmeel</i>, pp. 80-87). The legend evidently has an old basis, for it harmonizes with the statement given in Gen. xlviii. 22, which refers to Jacob's conquest of Shechem (cf. RX. margin). This form of the story is obviously independent of, and possibly older than, that given in Gen. xxxiv.</p>
