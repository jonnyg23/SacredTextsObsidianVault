 <p><a name="fn_520"></a><a href="jub41.htm#fr_522">113:1</a> A traditional title of Abraham. It goes back to Isa. xli. 8; cf. Jas. ii. 23, <i>T.B. Men.</i> 53<i>b</i>.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_521"></a><a href="jub42.htm#fr_523">113:2</a> The bracketed words a dittograph.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_522"></a><a href="jub42.htm#fr_524">113:3</a> This explains why Abraham did not take Hagar back. The later tradition (cf. <i>e. g.</i> <i>Pirḳe de R. Eliezer</i> xxx.) identifies Hagar with Keturah.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_523"></a><a href="jub42.htm#fr_525">113:4</a> Cf. Gen. xxv. 27 (where "plain" = lit. "upright"), and Gen. xxvii. 11 (combined here).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_524"></a><a href="jub42.htm#fr_526">113:5</a> According to the Targums the "tents" were academies. Jacob is represented as a lifelong student of the Torah (cf. <i>Ber. rabba</i> lxiii; <i>Pirḳe de R. Eliezer</i> xxxii.).</p>
