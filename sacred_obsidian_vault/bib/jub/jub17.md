 <p><a name="fn_154"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_154">52:7</a> For 13-14 cf. Gen. v. 9, 12.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_155"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_155">52:8</a> A fem. form = "she who praises God."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_156"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_156">52:9</a> Cf. Gen. v. 15.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_157"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_157">53:1</a> This last line looks like a quotation from 1 Enoch vi. 6 ("who descended in the days of Jared"). Note the play in Hebrew on the name <i>Jared</i> (<i>yāred</i>) and "descended" (Heb. <i>yārĕdû</i>). The myth of the descent of the angels was based on Gen. vi. 1-4, but was rejected by the Rabbis, who rendered "sons of God" (<i>i. e.</i> angels) "sons of the judges."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_158"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_158">53:2</a> This name is given to angels in Dan. iv. 13, 17, 23; in 1 Enoch it is applied especially to the fallen angels (cf. 1 Enoch i. 5, x. 9, 15 and often).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_159"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_159">53:3</a> This statement is interesting. It describes what was probably the original commission by God to the angelic watchers, who, however, fell when they descended to the earth. According to 1 Enoch, Enoch acquired his supernatural knowledge from the instruction of angels.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_160"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_160">53:4</a> Cf. Gen. v. 18.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_161"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_161">53:5</a> The passage that follows about Enoch (17-23) implies knowledge on the part of the author of Enochic writings. Charles infers that these were 1 Enoch vi-xvi., xxiii.-xxxvi., and lxxii.-xc.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_162"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_162">53:6</a> Cf. the phrase "Scribe of righteousness" applied to Enoch in 1 Enoch xii. 4, xv . 1.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_163"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_163">53:7</a> Probably a reference to 1 Enoch lxxii.-lxxxii. ("The Book of the courses of the Heavenly Luminaries ").</p>
 <p><a name="fn_164"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_164">53:8</a> There is nothing in 1 or 2 Enoch about "jubilees," etc. This statement is probably due solely to the author of <i>Jubilees</i>, who wished to invest the institution with a spurious antiquity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_165"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_165">54:1</a> The reference is probably to the "Dream-Visions" (1 Enoch lxxxiii.-xc.).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_166"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_166">54:2</a> <i>i. e.</i> Enoch. The writings of Enoch are mentioned elsewhere (1 Enoch, <i>Test. XII. Patriarchs</i>).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_167"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_167">54:3</a> <i>Edna</i> in 1 Enoch lxxxv. 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_168"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_168">54:4</a> Cf. Gen. V. 21.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_169"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_169">54:5</a> 1 Enoch xxiii.-xxxvi.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_170"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_170">54:6</a> Cf. 1 Enoch lxx. 1-3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_171"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_171">54:7</a> Cf. 1 Enoch xii. 3 f., xiv. i. The title ("Scribe of the Knowledge of the Most High") is conferred upon Ezra in 4 Ezra xiv. 50 (Syriac text).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_172"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_172">54:8</a> Cf. 2 Enoch xxxiv. 3.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_173"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_173">55:1</a> Cf. x. 17.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_174"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_174">55:2</a> Cf. Exod. xxx. 7.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_175"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_175">55:3</a> Three of these places are connected with critical events in the history of the world; Eden (with Adam), Sinai (with Moses), Zion (with David).</p>
 <p><a name="fn_176"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_176">55:4</a> The exact identification is uncertain; possibly the mount above Eden, where the Scthites live, is meant. Other suggestions are Mt. Ephraim, which would imply a Samaritan authorship, and Lubar, on Ararat, which would connect well with the history of Noah.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_177"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_177">55:5</a> Cf. i. 29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_178"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_178">55:6</a> Cf. Gen. v. 25.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_179"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_179">55:7</a> Cf. Gen. v. 29.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_180"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_180">55:8</a> Cf. iii. 32.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_181"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_181">55:9</a> This implies the view that Abel's body was not buried before Adam's. According to <i>Pirḳe de R. Eliezer</i> (xxi.), Adam was at first uncertain what to do, but then buried Abel's corpse.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_182"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_182">56:1</a> Cf. Gen. ii. 14. Notice that "day" here is interpreted as = 1000 years--a belief early current among Jews and Christians (cf. <i>Ber. rabba</i> xix. on Gen. iii. 8), 2 Pet. iii. 8. Justin Martyr, <i>Trypho.</i> lxxxi; cf. also <i>Pirḳe de R. Eliezer</i> xviii.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_183"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_183">56:2</a> The <i>lex talionis</i>; cf. Exod. xxi. 24 ("eye for eye, tooth for tooth"); Lev. xxiv. 19. Similar examples are given in 2 Macc. v. 19 f., xv. 32 f. The rigorous application of this "law" was upheld by the Sadducees, as against the Pharisees.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_184"></a><a href="jub17.htm#fr_184">56:3</a> Cf. Gen. V. 22. Note that Shem is represented as the eldest; cf. Gen. x. 21 (R.V.).</p>
