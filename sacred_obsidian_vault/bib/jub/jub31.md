   <h3 align="center">Abram with Lot in Canaan and Egypt (cf. Gen. xii. 4-20). Abram separates from Lot (cf. Gen. xiii. 11-18) (xiii. 1-21).</h3>  
 <p>XIII. And Abram journeyed from Haran, and he took Sarai, his wife, and Lot his brother Haran's son, to the land of Canaan, and he came into †Asshur†, <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">1</font></a> and proceeded to Shechem, and dwelt near a lofty oak. <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">2</font></a> 2. And he saw, and, behold, the land was very pleasant from the entering of Hamath to the lofty oak. <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">3</font></a>. And the Lord said to him: "To thee and to thy seed will I give this land." 4. And he built an altar there, and he offered thereon a burnt sacrifice to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 5. And he removed from thence unto the mountain . . . 3 Bethel on the west and Ai on the east, and pitched his tent there. <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">4</font></a> 6. And he saw and behold, the land was very wide and good, and everything grew thereon--vines and figs and pomegranates, oaks and ilexes, and terebinths and oil trees, and cedars and cypresses and date trees, and all trees of the field, and there was water on the mountains. 7. And he blessed the Lord who had led him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and had brought him to this land. 8. And it came </p><table align="LEFT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

  to pass in the first year, in the seventh week, on the new moon of the first month, that he built an altar on this mountain, and called on the name of the Lord: "Thou, the eternal God, art my God." <a name="fr_407"></a><a href="#fn_407"><font size="1">5</font></a> 9.

And he removed from thence and went towards the south, <a name="fr_408"></a><a href="#fn_408"><font size="1">1</font></a> and he came to Hebron, and Hebron was built at, that time, and he dwelt there two years, and he went (thence) into the land of the south, to Bealoth <a name="fr_409"></a><a href="#fn_409"><font size="1">2</font></a> and there was a famine in the land. 11.

NOW Tanais <a name="fr_411"></a><a href="#fn_411"><font size="1">4</font></a> in Egypt was at that time built--seven years after Hebron. <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">5</font></a> 11 And it came to pass when Pharaoh seized Sarai, the wife of Abram, that the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 14. And Abram was very glorious by reason of possessions in sheep, and cattle, and asses, and horses, and camels, and menservants, and maidservants, and in silver and gold exceedingly. And Lot also, his brother's son, was wealthy. 15. And Pharaoh gave back Sarai, the wife of Abram, and he sent him out of the land of Egypt, <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">6</font></a> and he journeyed to the place where he had pitched his tent at the beginning, to the place of the altar, with Ai on the east, and Bethel on the west, and he blessed the Lord his God who had brought him back in peace. <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">7</font></a> 16.

For all the land which thou seest I shall give to thee and to thy seed for ever, and I shall make thy seed as the sand of the sea: <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">2</font></a> though a man may number the dust of the earth, yet thy seed shall not be numbered. <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">3</font></a> 21. Arise, walk (through the land) in the length of it and the breadth of it, and see it all; for to thy seed shall I give it." And Abram went to Hebron, and dwelt there.</p>
