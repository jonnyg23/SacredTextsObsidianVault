  forty-second jubilee, Abraham returned and dwelt opposite Hebron, that is Kirjath Arba, two weeks of years. 2. And in the first year of the †third† <a name="fr_518"></a><a href="#fn_517"><font size="1">1</font></a> week of this jubilee the days of the life of Sarah were accomplished, and she died in Hebron. 3.
