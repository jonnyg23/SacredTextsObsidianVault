   <h3 align="center">The decreasing Years and increasing Corruption of Mankind (xxiii. 9-17).</h3>  
 <p>9. For the days of the forefathers, of their life, were nineteen jubilees; and after the Flood they began to grow less than nineteen jubilees, and to decrease in jubilees, and to grow old quickly, and to be full of their days by reason of manifold tribulation and the wickedness of their ways, with the exception of Abraham. <a name="fr_609"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">2</font></a> 10. For Abraham was perfect in all his deeds with the Lord, and well-pleasing in righteousness all the days of his life; and behold, he did not complete four jubilees in his life, when he had grown old by reason of the wickedness <a name="fr_610"></a><a href="#fn_608"><font size="1">3</font></a> and was full of his days. 11. And all the generations which will arise from this time until the day of the great judgment will grow old quickly, before they complete two jubilees, and their knowledge will forsake them by reason of their old age [and all their knowledge will vanish away]. <a name="fr_611"></a><a href="#fn_609"><font size="1">4</font></a> 12. And in those days, if a man live a jubilee and a half of years, they will say regarding him: "He hath lived long, and the greater part of his days are pain and sorrow and</p>

 <p>tribulation, <a name="fr_612"></a><a href="#fn_610"><font size="1">1</font></a> and there is no peace: 13. For calamity followeth on calamity, and wound on wound, and tribulation on tribulation, and evil tidings on evil tidings, and illness on illness, and all evil judgments such as these, one with another, illness and overthrow, and snow and frost and ice, and fever, and chills, and torpor, and famine, and death, and sword, and captivity, and all kinds of calamities and pains." <a name="fr_613"></a><a href="#fn_611"><font size="1">2</font></a> 14. And all these will come on an evil generation, which transgresseth on the earth: their works are uncleanness and fornication, and pollution and abominations. <a name="fr_614"></a><a href="#fn_612"><font size="1">3</font></a> 15. Then they will say: "The days of the forefathers were many (even), unto a thousand years, and were good; but, behold, the days of our life, if a man hath lived many, are three score years and ten, and, if he is strong, four score years, and those evil <a name="fr_615"></a><a href="#fn_613"><font size="1">4</font></a> and there is no peace in the days of this evil generation." 16. And in that generation the sons will convict their fathers and their elders of sin and unrighteousness, <a name="fr_616"></a><a href="#fn_614"><font size="1">5</font></a> and of the words of their mouth and the great wickednesses which they perpetrate, and concerning their forsaking the covenant <a name="fr_617"></a><a href="#fn_615"><font size="1">6</font></a> which the Lord made between them and Him, that they should observe and do all His commandments and His ordinances and all His laws, without departing either to the right hand or to the left. <a name="fr_618"></a><a href="#fn_616"><font size="1">7</font></a> 17. For all have done evil, <a name="fr_619"></a><a href="#fn_617"><font size="1">8</font></a> and every mouth speaketh iniquity <a name="fr_620"></a><a href="#fn_618"><font size="1">9</font></a> and all their works are an uncleanness and an abomination, and all their ways are pollution, uncleanness and destruction.</p>
