  XI. And in the thirty-fifth jubilee, in the third week, in the first year thereof, Reu took to himself a wife, and her name was Ôrâ, the daughter of Ûr, the son of Kêsêd, and she bare him a son, and he <table align="LEFT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

And Ûr, the son of Kêsêd, <a name="fr_376"></a><a href="#fn_376"><font size="1">4</font></a> built the city of Arâ <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">5</font></a> of the Chaldees, and called its name after his own name and the name of his father. 4. And they made for themselves molten images, and they worshipped each the idol, the molten image which they had made for themselves, and they began to make graven images and unclean simulacra, and malignant spirits assisted

 <p>and seduced (them) into committing transgression and uncleanness. 5. And the prince Mastêmâ exerted himself to do all this, and he sent forth other spirits, those which were put under his hand, to do all manner of wrong and sin, and all manner of transgression, to corrupt and destroy, and to shed blood upon the earth. <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">1</font></a> 6. For this reason he called the name of Sêrôḫ, Serug, for every one turned to do all manner of sin and transgression. 7. And he grew up, and dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees, near to the father of his wife's mother, and he worshipped idols, and he took to himself a wife in the thirty-sixth jubilee, in the </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

Before they could plough in the seed, the ravens picked (it) from the surface of the ground. 12. And for this reason he called his name Terah, because the ravens and the birds reduced them to destitution and devoured their seed. <a name="fr_382"></a><a href="#fn_382"><font size="1">5</font></a> 13.
