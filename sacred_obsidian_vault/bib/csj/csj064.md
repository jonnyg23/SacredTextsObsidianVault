 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Mark 10, 1-12: Matthew 19, 1-12.</font></p>  
 <p>INTO the coasts of Judea by the farther side of Jordan, multitudes followed Jesus: and the people resort unto him; and, as he was wont, he taught them.</p>  
 <p>¶The Pharisees also came, and tempting him asked Jesus, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">*</font></a> He answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">What did Moses command you?</div>  
 <p>They said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">For the hardness of your heart he wrote you his precept. But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife.  
 <p>Have ye not read, that he which made <i>them</i> at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? So then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.</p></div>  
 <p>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away? He saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except <i>it be</i> for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</div>  
 <p>In the house his disciples asked Jesus again of the same <i>matter</i>. He saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</div>  
 <p>The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. But Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">All <i>men</i> cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men:</div>  
 <p>

 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.  
 <p>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p></div>

 <p><a name="fn_74"></a><a href="csj064.htm#fr_77">95:*</a> The account of this episode in Mark 10 gains interest by comparison with that in Matthew 19. See also Matthew 5, 31-32; and Luke 16, 18.</p>
