 <p align="center">A.D. 96.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Revelation 2, 18-29.</font></p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">AND unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write;  
 <p>These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</p>  
 <p>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <i>to be</i> more than the first.</p>  
 <p>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>  
 <p>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. But that which ye have <i>already</i>, hold fast till I come.</p>  
 <p>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. And I will give him the morning star.</p></div>  
 <p>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
