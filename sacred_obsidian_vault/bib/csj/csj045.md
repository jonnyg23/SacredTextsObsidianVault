 <p align="center">A.D. 29. Age 32. <i>Galilee</i>. <i>Capernaum</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Mark 9, 30-37: Luke 9, 44-48: Matthew 17, 22-27.</font></p>  
 <p>JESUS departed thence, and passed through Galilee. While in Galilee, all wondered at the things which Jesus did. But while they wondered, Jesus said unto his disciples,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be betrayed, and delivered into the hands of men: and they shall kill him; and the third day after that he is killed, he shall be raised again.</div>  
 <p>But they understood not.</p>  
 <p>¶There arose a reasoning among the disciples: for by the way [to Capernaum] they had disputed amongst themselves which of them should be the greatest. In the house Jesus asked,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</div>  
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a></p>  
 <p>But they held their peace: and Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">If any man desire to be first, <i>the same</i> shall be last of all.</div>  
 <p>He took a child in his arms, and said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth me not, but him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</div>  
 <p>When they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute <i>money</i> came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</p>  
 <p>Peter saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">*</font></a> him, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</div>  
 <p>Peter saith, of strangers. Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Then are the children free.  
 <p>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou has opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">†</font></a></p></div>
