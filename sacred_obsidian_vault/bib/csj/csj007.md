 <p align="center">A.D. 27. Age 30 <i>Judea: Jordan</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 3, 1-6; 13-17: Mark 1, 10-11; Luke 3, 22-23.</font></p>  
 <p>IN those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>  
 <p>This is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

 <p>John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>  
 <p>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>  
 <p>¶Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>  
 <p>Jesus answering said unto him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Suffer <i>it to be so</i> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.</div>  
 <p>Then John suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and praying, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending in a bodily shape like a dove, and lighting upon him; and to a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>  
 <p>And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age.</p>
