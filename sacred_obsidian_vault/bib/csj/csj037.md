 <p>WHEN Jesus saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</div>  
 <p>This he said to prove Philip, for he himself knew what he would do. Jesus’ disciples said, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</p>  
 <p>Philip answered, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient.</p>  
 <p>¶When the day began to wear away, then came the twelve and said, This is a desert place: send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and villages round about, and lodge, and buy themselves victuals: for they have nothing to eat. Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">They need not depart; give ye them to eat. How many loaves have ye? Go and see.</div>  
 <p>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith, A lad here hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? Jesus said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Bring them hither to me. Make the men sit down by fifties in a company.</div>  
 <p>Now there was much green grass in the place. So the men sat down, in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p>  
 <p>Jesus took the loaves, and when, looking up to heaven, he had given thanks, he blessed and brake, and distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes.</p>  
 <p>They did all eat. And when they were filled, Jesus said unto his disciples,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</div>  
 <p>They filled twelve baskets. They that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
