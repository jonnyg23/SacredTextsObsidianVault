 <p align="center">A.D. 96.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Revelation 3, 7-13.</font></p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">AND to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write;  
 <p>These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p>  
 <p>I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p>  
 <p>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>  
 <p>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p>  
 <p>Behold, I come quickly; hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</p>  
 <p>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, <i>which is</i> new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God; and <i>I will write upon him</i> my new name.</p></div>  
 <p>Him that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
