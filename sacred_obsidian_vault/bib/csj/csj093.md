 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Sea of Galilee</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">John 21, 1-25.</font></p>  
 <p>JESUS shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">*</font></a> and on this wise: there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</p>  
 <p>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say, We go with thee. They entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>  
 <p>But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then saith he unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Children, have ye any meat?</div>  
 <p>They answered, No. And he said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</div>  
 <p>They cast; and as soon as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</div>  
 <p>Peter drew the net to land full of great fishes, and for all there were so many; yet was not the net broken.</p>  
 <p>Jesus saith unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Come <i>and</i> dine.</div>  
 <p>Jesus then taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</p>  
 <p>¶So when they had dined, Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</div>  
 <p>He saith, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Feed my lambs.</div>  
 <p>He saith the second time,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</div>  
 <p>He saith, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Feed my sheep.</div>  
 <p>He saith the third time,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</div>  
 <p>Peter was grieved because he said the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Feed my sheep.  
 <p>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shall be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <i>thee</i> whither thou wouldest not.</p></div>  
 <p>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And he saith unto Peter,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Follow me.</div>  
 <p>Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple following, whom Jesus loved. <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">*</font></a> Seeing him, Peter saith, Lord, and what <i>shall</i> this man <i>do?</i> Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee? follow thou me.</div>  
 <p>This is the disciple <a name="fr_110"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">*</font></a> which testifieth of these things: and wrote these things. And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.</p>
