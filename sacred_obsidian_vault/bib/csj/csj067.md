 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Bethphage</i>. <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">John 11, 55-57: Matthew 21, 1-6: Mark 77, 1-11: Luke 19, 28-44.</font></p>  
 <p>THE Jews’ passover was nigh at hand; and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem, before the passover, to purify themselves. Jesus went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</p>  
 <p>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where Jesus were, he should shew <i>it</i>, that they might take him. Then they sought for him.</p>  
 <p>¶When Jesus was come to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, nigh unto Jerusalem, he sendeth forth two disciples, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Go ye your way into the village over against you, in the which, as soon as ye be entered into it, straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her, <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">*</font></a> whereon yet never man sat; loose them, and bring <i>them</i> hither unto me.  
 <p>And if any man say aught unto you, and ask you, Why do ye this? why do ye loose them? ye shall say, Because the Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them hither.</p></div>  
 <p>The [two] disciples went, and did as Jesus had commanded. The owners said, Why loose ye them? They answered, The Lord hath need of them. And they let them go.</p>  
 <p>They brought the ass, and the colt, and put their garments on the colt; and they set Jesus thereon.</p>  
 <p>As he went, many spread their clothes in the way; and others cut branches off the trees, and strewed them in the way.</p>

 <p>At the descent of the mount of Olives, the multitude began to praise God, saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of he Lord. Hosanna in the highest: peace in heaven!</p>  
 <p>Some of the Pharisees said unto Jesus, Master, rebuke thy disciples. He answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</div>  
 <p>¶When Jesus was come near, he beheld the city (Jerusalem), and wept over it, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things <i>which</i> belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.  
 <p>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side. And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p></div>  
 <p>¶When Jesus was come into Jerusalem, he taught daily in the temple. All the city was moved. The blind and the lame came to him, and he healed them.</p>  
 <p>The wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David, displeased the chief priests and the scribes; and they said unto Jesus, Hearest thou what these say? He answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</div>  
 <p>And when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out. With the twelve he went unto Bethany, and lodged there.</p>
