 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Perea</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 20, 17-28: Mark 10, 32-45: Luke 18, 31-34.</font></p>  
 <p>JESUS going up to Jerusalem took again the disciples apart in the way, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, <i>saying</i>,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed and delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and he shall be spitefully entreated and spitted on; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles.  
 <p>They shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>  
 <p>And all the things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</p></div>  
 <p>They (the twelve) understood none of this saying; neither knew they the things which were spoken.</p>  
 <p>¶Then came unto Jesus the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, desiring a certain thing of him. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">*</font></a> He said unto her,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">What wilt thou?  
 <p>And he said unto them,</p>  
 <p>What would ye that I should do for you?</p></div>  
 <p>She saith, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in glory in thy kingdom. But Jesus said <i>unto them</i>,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Ye know not what ye ask: are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</div>  
 <p>And they say, We can. Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, the cup that I drink of: and with the baptism that I am baptized withal ye shall be baptized: but to sit</div>

 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give, but <i>it shall be given to them</i> for whom it is prepared of my Father.</div>  
 <p>The ten were moved with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus called them to <i>him</i>, and said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  
 <p>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all: let him be your servant, even as the Son of man: for even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p></div>
