 <p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31. <i>Galilee: Capernaum</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Mark 1, 16-26; Luke 4, 31 . . . 38 . . . 44; Matthew 4, 17 . . . 25.</font></p>  
 <p>NOW as Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. He said unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. Follow me.</div>  
 <p>Straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>  
 <p>When he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in a ship with their father, mending their nets. He called them: and they left their father in the ship with the hired servants, and followed Jesus.</p>  
 <p>¶They went into Capernaum; and on the sabbath day Jesus entered into the synagogue, and taught. They were astonished: for his word was with power: he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>  
 <p>There was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, Let <i>us</i> alone, thou Jesus of Nazareth. Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art: the Holy One of God.</p>  
 <p>Jesus rebuked him, saying,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</div>  
 <p>When the unclean spirit had thrown the man in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</p>  
 <p>¶Jesus arose, and, when they were come out of the synagogue, entered the house of Peter and Andrew, with James and John.</p>  
 <p>¶In the morning, rising up a great while before day, Jesus went out into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>  
 <p>The people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart. He said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</div>  
 <p>Simon and they that were with him followed after Jesus, and when they had found him, they said unto him,  <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">*</font></a>All <i>men</i> seek for thee. He answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</div>  
 <p>¶And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom. His fame went throughout Syria. And there followed him multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis; <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">*</font></a> <i>from</i> Jerusalem, and Judea; and <i>from</i> beyond Jordan.</p>
