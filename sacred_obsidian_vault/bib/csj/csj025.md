 <p align="center">A.D. 28. Age 31. <i>Capernaum. Nain</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 8, 5-13: Luke 7, 11-18.</font></p>  
 <p>WHEN Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion beseeching him, saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</p>  
 <p>The elders of the Jews came, saying, That he was worthy: for he loveth our nation, and hath built us a synagogue.</p>  
 <p>And Jesus saith unto the centurion,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I will come and heal him.</div>  
 <p>The centurion answered, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. Jesus marvelled, and turned and said to the people that followed him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</div>  
 <p>And Jesus said unto the centurion,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, <i>so</i> be it done unto thee.</div>

 <p>His servant was healed in the selfsame hour. <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>¶The day after, Jesus went into a city called Nain: many of his disciples, and much people went with him.</p>  
 <p>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of a widow: much people of the city was with her. The Lord had compassion on her, and said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Weep not.</div>  
 <p>He touched the bier, and they that bare <i>him</i> stood still. Jesus said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</div>  
 <p>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.</p>  
 <p>There came a fear on all: they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen among us.</p>  
 <p>This rumor of Jesus went forth throughout all Judea and the region round about. And the disciples of John shewed him [John the Baptist] of all these things.</p>
