 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Mount of Olives. Gethsemane</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 26, 30-47: Mark 14, 26-43: Luke 22, 39-47: John 18, 1-9.</font></p>  
 <p> <a name="fr_99"></a><a href="#fn_95"><font size="1">*</font></a>WHEN they had sung a hymn, Jesus came out; and he went as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him. Then saith Jesus unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">All ye shall be offended <a name="fr_100"></a><a href="#fn_96"><font size="1">†</font></a> because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  
 <p>But after that I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p></div>  
 <p>Peter answered, Although all shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will not I. I will never be offended. Jesus saith unto him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Verily I say unto thee, That this day, <i>even</i> in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div>  
 <p>But Peter spake the more vehemently, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee in any wise. Likewise said they all.</p>  
 <p>¶They came to a place named Gethsemane, over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which Jesus entered and his disciples. And he said unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</div>  
 <p>He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast; with him Peter, James, and John. Then saith he unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</div>  
 <p>He went forward a little, and kneeled, and prayed,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Abba, Father, all things <i>are</i> possible unto thee: Father, if it be possible, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. <a name="fr_101"></a><a href="#fn_97"><font size="1">‡</font></a></div>

 <p>Being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood.</p>  
 <p>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping. He saith unto Peter,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Simon, sleepest thou? What, couldest not thou watch with me one hour? Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.</div>  
 <p>Jesus went away the second time, and prayed,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</div>  
 <p>When he rose up, and was come to the disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, and he said unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</div>  
 <p>He went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Father, take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</div>  
 <p>And he cometh the third time, and again he found the disciples asleep; and he saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: it is enough: behold, the hour is come; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us be going: lo, he is at hand that doth betray me.</div>  
 <p>¶Judas knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</p>  
 <p>Immediately, while Jesus yet spake, cometh Judas, and with him a multitude: a band <i>of men</i> from the chief priests and Pharisees; and the scribes and elders of the people, with lanterns and torches, and weapons: swords and staves.</p>  
 <p>Jesus knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Whom seek ye?</div>  
 <p>They answered, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I am he.</div>  
 <p>They went backward, and fell to the ground. Then asked he them again,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Whom seek ye?</div>  
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></a></p>  
 <p>They said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I have told you that I am <i>he:</i> if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way.</div>  
 <p>That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</div>
