 <p align="center">A.D. 27. Age 30. <i>Cana</i>. <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">John 2, 1-9; 12-16; 18-21.</font></p>  
 <p>THE third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage; and the mother of Jesus was there.</p>  
 <p>When they wanted wine, his mother saith unto Jesus, They have no wine. Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</div>  
 <p>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith, do <i>it</i>.</p>  
 <p>There were set there six waterpots of stone containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Fill the waterpots with water.</div>  
 <p>They filled them to the brim. And he saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</div>  
 <p>And they bare <i>it</i>. The ruler of the feast tasted. The water was made wine.</p>  
 <p>¶After this he went to Capernaum, Jesus, and his mother, and his brethren,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>and his disciples; and they continued there not many days.</p>  
 <p>¶The Jews’ passover was at hand: Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>  
 <p>¶ <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">*</font></a>He found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves; and the changers of money sitting: and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto them that sold doves,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Take these things hence, make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</div>  
 <p>¶Then the Jews said unto Jesus, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? He answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">†</font></a></div>  
 <p>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>  
 <p>But Jesus spake of the temple of his body.</p>
