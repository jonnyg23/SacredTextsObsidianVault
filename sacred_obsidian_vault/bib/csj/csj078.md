 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Bethany. Jerusalem: Upper Room</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Luke 21, 37-38; 22, 1-18: Matthew 26, 1-5; 14-20: Mark 14, 1-2; 10-17: John 13, 2-17.</font></p>  
 <p>NOW the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the passover. In the daytime Jesus was teaching in the temple. At night he abode in the mount of Olives; in the morning the people came early to the temple for to hear him.</p>  
 <p>Two days before <i>the feast</i>, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people, assembled unto the palace of the high priest Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by craft. But they said, Not on the feast <i>day</i>, lest there be an uproar of <a href="errata.htm#4">the</a> people.</p>  
 <p>¶Then Judas surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve, went and said unto the chief priests, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Jesus unto you? They were glad, and <a href="errata.htm#5">covenanted</a> to give Judas thirty pieces of silver. Judas promised: and sought opportunity how he might conveniently betray Jesus unto them in the absence of the multitude.</p>  
 <p>¶Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, he said unto his disciples,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Ye know that after two days is <i>the feast of</i> passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</div>  
 <p>Then came the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast</i> of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed; and Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Go and prepare the passover, that we may eat.</div>  
 <p>And they said, Where wilt thou that we prepare? He said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">When ye are entered into the city, behold, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: go ye into the city to such a man, and follow him into the house where he entereth in. And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  
 <p>And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</p></div>  
 <p>They went, and found as he had said: and they made ready the passover. In the evening Jesus cometh with the twelve apostles, and when the hour was come, he sat down, the twelve with him.</p>  
 <p>And he said unto them,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</div>  
 <p>And he took the cup and gave thanks, and said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Take this, and divide <i>it</i> among yourselves: for I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</div>  
 <p>Supper being ended, Jesus riseth; and he laid aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel.</p>  
 <p>Then Simon Peter saith, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</div>  
 <p>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</div>  
 <p>Peter saith, Lord, not my feet only, but also <i>my</i> hands and <i>my</i> head. Jesus saith unto him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</div>  
 <p>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Ye are not all clean.</div>  
 <p>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them,</p>  
 <p>Know ye what I have done to you?</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet: ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  
 <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord: neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p></div>
