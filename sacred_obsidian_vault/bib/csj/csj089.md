 <p align="center">A.D. 30. Age 33. <i>Jerusalem. Golgotha: Calvary</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">Matthew 27, 39-56: Mark 15, 29-41: Luke 23, 35-49: John 19, 23-30.</font></p>  
 <p>THE soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part: casting lots upon them.</p>  
 <p>The people that passed by derided <i>him</i>, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it</i> in three days, save thyself!</p>  
 <p>The soldiers also mocked him, saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself!</p>  
 <p>Likewise the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save!</p>  
 <p>One of the two thieves which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth; but the other rebuked him, saying, Dost thou not fear God? We receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>  
 <p>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>  
 <p>Jesus said unto him,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</div>  
 <p>¶Now there stood by the cross Jesus’ mother, and his mother's sister; Mary the <i>wife</i> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved: <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_101"><font size="1">*</font></a> and he saith unto his mother,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Woman, behold thy son!</div>  
 <p>Then saith he to the disciple,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Behold thy mother!</div>  
 <p>And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own <i>home</i>.</p>  
 <p>¶Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</div>  
 <p>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, saith,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">I thirst.</div>  
 <p>

 <p>Straightway one of them ran, and filled a sponge with vinegar, put <i>it</i> upon hysop (on a reed), and put it to Jesus’ mouth. When he had received the vinegar, he said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">It is finished.</div>  
 <p>And when he had cried again with a loud voice, he said,</p>  
 <p></p><div class="jesussaid">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit!</div>  
 <p>Having said thus, Jesus bowed his head, and yielded up the ghost.</p>  
 <p>¶All his acquaintance stood afar off, beholding these things. There were also women looking on: among which was Mary Magdalene; and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses; and Salome the mother of Zebedee's children; and many other women which came up with Jesus into Jerusalem.</p>
