  <h3 align="center">Basic English Bible: Philemon</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.</p>
