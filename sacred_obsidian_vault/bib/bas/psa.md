 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners, or take his place in the way of evil-doers, or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and whose mind is on his law day and night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> He will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which gives its fruit at the right time, whose leaves will ever be green; and he will do well in all his undertakings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> The evil-doers are not so; but are like the dust from the grain, which the wind takes away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged, and the evil-doers will have no place among the upright,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Because the Lord sees the way of the upright, but the end of the sinner is destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The kings of the earth have taken their place, and the rulers are fixed in their purpose, against the Lord, and against the king of his selection, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Let their chains be broken, and their cords taken from off us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing: the Lord will make sport of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Then will his angry words come to their ears, and by his wrath they will be troubled:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But I have put my king on my holy hill of Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> I will make clear the Lord's decision: he has said to me, You are my son, this day have I given you being.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Make your request to me, and I will give you the nations for your heritage, and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> They will be ruled by you with a rod of iron; they will be broken like a potter's vessel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> So now be wise, you kings: take his teaching, you judges of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Give worship to the Lord with fear, kissing his feet and giving him honour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> For fear that he may be angry, causing destruction to come on you, because he is quickly moved to wrath. Happy are all those who put their faith in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> &lt;A Psalm. Of David. When he went in flight from Absalom his son.&gt; Lord, how greatly are they increased who make attacks on me! in great numbers they come against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Unnumbered are those who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> But your strength, O Lord, is round me, you are my glory and the lifter up of my head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> I send up a cry to the Lord with my voice, and he gives me an answer from his holy hill. (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> I took my rest in sleep, and then again I was awake; for the Lord was my support.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I will have no fear, though ten thousand have come round me, putting themselves against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Come to me, Lord; keep me safe, O my God; for you have given all my haters blows on their face-bones; the teeth of the evil-doers have been broken by you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Salvation comes from the Lord; your blessing is on your people. (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker on corded instruments. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Give answer to my cry, O God of my righteousness; make me free from my troubles; have mercy on me, and give ear to my prayer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> O you sons of men, how long will you go on turning my glory into shame? how long will you give your love to foolish things, going after what is false? (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> See how the Lord has made great his mercy for me; the Lord will give ear to my cry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Let there be fear in your hearts, and do no sin; have bitter feelings on your bed, but make no sound. (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Give the offerings of righteousness, and put your faith in the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> There are numbers who say, Who will do us any good? the light of his face has gone from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Lord, you have put joy in my heart, more than they have when their grain and their wine are increased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> I will take my rest on my bed in peace, because you only, Lord, keep me safe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker on wind instruments. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Give ear to my words, O Lord; give thought to my heart-searchings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Let the voice of my cry come to you, my King and my God; for to you will I make my prayer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> My voice will come to you in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I send my prayer to you, and keep watch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wrongdoing; there is no evil with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> The sons of pride have no place before you; you are a hater of all workers of evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> You will send destruction on those whose words are false; the cruel man and the man of deceit are hated by the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> But as for me, I will come into your house, in the full measure of your mercy; and in your fear I will give worship, turning my eyes to your holy Temple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Be my guide, O Lord, in the ways of your righteousness, because of those who are against me; make your way straight before my face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> For no faith may be put in their words; their inner part is nothing but evil; their throat is like an open place for the dead; smooth are the words of their tongues.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Send them to destruction, O Lord; let their evil designs be the cause of their fall; let them be forced out by all their sins; because they have gone against your authority.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> But let all those who put their faith in you be glad with cries of joy at all times, and let all the lovers of your name be glad in you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> For you, Lord, will send a blessing on the upright man; your grace will be round him, and you will be his strength.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker on corded instruments, on the Sheminith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O Lord, do not be bitter with me in your wrath; do not send punishment on me in the heat of your passion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am wasted away: make me well, for even my bones are troubled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> My soul is in bitter trouble; and you, O Lord, how long?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Come back, O Lord, make my soul free; O give me salvation because of your mercy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> For in death there is no memory of you; in the underworld who will give you praise?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> The voice of my sorrow is a weariness to me; all the night I make my bed wet with weeping; it is watered by the drops flowing from my eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> My eyes are wasting away with trouble; they are becoming old because of all those who are against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Go from me, all you workers of evil; for the Lord has given ear to the voice of my weeping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> The Lord has given ear to my request; the Lord has let my prayer come before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Let all those who are against me be shamed and deeply troubled; let them be turned back and suddenly put to shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> &lt;Shiggaion of David; a song which he made to the Lord, about the words of Cush the Benjamite.&gt; O Lord my God, I put my faith in you; take me out of the hands of him who is cruel to me, and make me free;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> So that he may not come rushing on my soul like a lion, wounding it, while there is no one to be my saviour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> O Lord my God, if I have done this; if my hands have done any wrong;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> If I have given back evil to him who did evil to me, or have taken anything from him who was against me without cause;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Let my hater go after my soul and take it; let my life be crushed to the earth, and my honour into the dust. (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Come up, Lord, in your wrath; be lifted up against my haters; be awake, my God, give orders for the judging.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> The meeting of the nations will be round you; take your seat, then, over them, on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> The Lord will be judge of the peoples; give a decision for me, O Lord, because of my righteousness, and let my virtue have its reward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> O let the evil of the evil-doer come to an end, but give strength to the upright: for men's minds and hearts are tested by the God of righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> God, who is the saviour of the upright in heart, is my breastplate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> God is the judge of the upright, and is angry with the evil-doers every day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> If a man is not turned from his evil, he will make his sword sharp; his bow is bent and ready.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> He has made ready for him the instruments of death; he makes his arrows flames of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> That man is a worker of evil; the seed of wrongdoing has given birth to deceit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> He has made a hole deep in the earth, and is falling into the hole which he has made</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> His wrongdoing will come back to him, and his violent behaviour will come down on his head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> I will give praise to the Lord for his righteousness; I will make a song to the name of the Lord Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker on the Gittith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O Lord, our Lord, whose glory is higher than the heavens, how noble is your name in all the earth!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> You have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast, because of those who are against you; so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have put in their places;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> What is man, that you keep him in mind? the son of man, that you take him into account?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> For you have made him only a little lower than the gods, crowning him with glory and honour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> You have made him ruler over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> All sheep and oxen, and all the beasts of the field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> The birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> O Lord, our Lord, how noble is your name in all the earth!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker on Muthlabben. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; I will give you praise, O Lord, with all my heart; I will make clear all the wonder of your works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> I will be glad and have delight in you: I will make a song of praise to your name, O Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> When my haters are turned back, they will be broken and overcome before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> For you gave approval to my right and my cause; you were seated in your high place judging in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> You have said sharp words to the nations, you have sent destruction on the sinners, you have put an end to their name for ever and ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> You have given their towns to destruction; the memory of them has gone; they have become waste for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> But the Lord is King for ever: he has made ready his high seat for judging.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And he will be the judge of the world in righteousness, giving true decisions for the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> The Lord will be a high tower for those who are crushed down, a high tower in times of trouble;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And those who have knowledge of your name will put their faith in you; because you, Lord, have ever given your help to those who were waiting for you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> Make songs of praise to the Lord, whose house is in Zion: make his doings clear to the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> When he makes search for blood, he has them in his memory: he is not without thought for the cry of the poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Have mercy on me, O Lord, and see how I am troubled by my haters; let me be lifted up from the doors of death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> So that I may make clear all your praise in the house of the daughter of Zion: I will be glad because of your salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> The nations have gone down into the hole which they made: in their secret net is their foot taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> The Lord has given knowledge of himself through his judging: the evil-doer is taken in the net which his hands had made. (Higgaion. Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> The sinners and all the nations who have no memory of God will be turned into the underworld.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> For the poor will not be without help; the hopes of those in need will not be crushed for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Up! O Lord; let not man overcome you: let the nations be judged before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Put them in fear, O Lord, so that the nations may see that they are only men. (Selah.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Why do you keep far away, O Lord? why are you not to be seen in times of trouble?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> The evil-doer in his pride is cruel to the poor; let him be taken by the tricks of his invention.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the evil-doer is lifted up because of the purpose of his heart, and he whose mind is fixed on wealth is turned away from the Lord, saying evil against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> The evil-doer in his pride says, God will not make a search. All his thoughts are, There is no God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> His ways are ever fixed; your decisions are higher than he may see: as for his haters, they are as nothing to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> He has said in his heart, I will not be moved: through all generations I will never be in trouble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and false words: under his tongue are evil purposes and dark thoughts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> He is waiting in the dark places of the towns: in the secret places he puts to death those who have done no wrong: his eyes are secretly turned against the poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> He keeps himself in a secret place like a lion in his hole, waiting to put his hands on the poor man, and pulling him into his net.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> The upright are crushed and made low, and the feeble are overcome by his strong ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> He says in his heart, God has no memory of me: his face is turned away; he will never see it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Up! O Lord; let your hand be lifted: give thought to the poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Why has the evil-doer a low opinion of God, saying in his heart, You will not make search for it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> You have seen it; for your eyes are on sorrow and grief, to take it into your hand: the poor man puts his faith in you; you have been the helper of the child who has no father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Let the arm of the sinner and the evil-doer be broken; go on searching for his sin till there is no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are gone from his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Lord, you have given ear to the prayer of the poor: you will make strong their hearts, you will give them a hearing:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> To give decision for the child without a father and for the broken-hearted, so that the man of the earth may no longer be feared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> &lt;For the chief music-maker. Of David.&gt; In the Lord put I my faith; how will you say to my soul, Go in flight like a bird to the mountain?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> See, the bows of the evil-doers are bent, they make ready their arrows on the cord, so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> If the bases are broken down, what is the upright man to do?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lord's seat is in heaven; his eyes are watching and testing the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> The Lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test, but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> On the evil-doer he will send down fire and flames, and a burning wind; with these will their cup be full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For the Lord is upright; he is a lover of righteousness: the upright will see his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> &lt;For the chief music-maker on the Sheminith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Send help, Lord, for mercy has come to an end; there is no more faith among the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Everyone says false words to his neighbour: their tongues are smooth in their talk, and their hearts are full of deceit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> The smooth lips and the tongue of pride will be cut off by the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> They have said, With our tongues will we overcome; our lips are ours: who is lord over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Because of the crushing of the poor and the weeping of those in need, now will I come to his help, says the Lord; I will give him the salvation which he is desiring.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> The words of the Lord are true words: like silver tested by fire and burned clean seven times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> You will keep them, O Lord, you will keep them safe from this generation for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> The sinners are walking on every side, and evil is honoured among the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Will you for ever put me out of your memory, O Lord? will your face for ever be turned away from me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> How long is my soul to be in doubt, with sorrow in my heart all the day? how long will he who is against me be given power over me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Let my voice come before you, and give me an answer, O Lord my God; let your light be shining on me, so that the sleep of death may not overtake me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And he who is against me may not say, I have overcome him; and those who are troubling me may not be glad when I am moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> But I have had faith in your mercy; my heart will be glad in your salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> I will make a song to the Lord, because he has given me my reward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker. Of David.&gt; The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Have all the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food as they would take bread; they make no prayer to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> Then were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the upright.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor, but the Lord is his support.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord, Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Lord, who may have a resting-place in your tent, a living-place on your holy hill?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> He who goes on his way uprightly, doing righteousness, and saying what is true in his heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> Whose tongue is not false, who does no evil to his friend, and does not take away the good name of his neighbour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> Who gives honour to those who have the fear of the Lord, turning away from him who has not the Lord's approval. He who takes an oath against himself, and makes no change.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> He who does not put out his money at interest, or for payment give false decisions against men who have done no wrong. He who does these things will never be moved.</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> The Lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup; you are the supporter of my right.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> Fair are the places marked out for me; I have a noble heritage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> I will give praise to the Lord who has been my guide; knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> I have put the Lord before me at all times; because he is at my right hand, I will not be moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> Because of this my heart is glad, and my glory is full of joy: while my flesh takes its rest in hope.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> You have put my heart to the test, searching me in the night; you have put me to the test and seen no evil purpose in me; I will keep my mouth from sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> As for the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> I have kept my feet in your ways, my steps have not been turned away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> My cry has gone up to you, for you will give me an answer, O God: let your ear be turned to me, and give attention to my words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> Make clear the wonder of your mercy, O saviour of those who put their faith in your right hand, from those who come out against them.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> They are shut up in their fat: with their mouths they say words of pride.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> They have made a circle round our steps: their eyes are fixed on us, forcing us down to the earth;</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> Up! Lord, come out against him, make him low, with your sword be my saviour from the evil-doer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> With your hand, O Lord, from men, even men of the world, whose heritage is in this life, and whom you make full with your secret wealth: they are full of children; after their death their offspring take the rest of their goods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> As for me, I will see your face in righteousness: when I am awake it will be joy enough for me to see your form.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> &lt;To the chief music-maker.

 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour; my God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> The cords of death were round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came before him, even into his ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> Then trouble and shock came on the earth; and the bases of the mountains were moved and shaking, because he was angry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: flames were lighted by it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And he went in flight through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> He made the dark his secret place; his tent round him was the dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out: a rain of ice and fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> He sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> Then the deep beds of the waters were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of your words of wrath, O Lord, because of the breath from your mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> He made me free from my strong hater, and from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> They came on me in the day of my trouble; but the Lord was my support.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but eyes full of pride will be made low.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> You, O Lord, will be my light; by you, my God, the dark will be made bright for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in; by the help of my God I have gone over a wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> As for God, his way is completely good; the word of the Lord is tested; he is a breastplate for all those who put their faith in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:31">18:31</a> For who is God but the Lord? or who is a Rock but our God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:32">18:32</a> God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:33">18:33</a> He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:34">18:34</a> He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:35">18:35</a> You have given me the breastplate of your salvation: your right hand has been my support, and your mercy has made me great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:36">18:36</a> You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet are kept from slipping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:37">18:37</a> I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:38">18:38</a> I will give them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:39">18:39</a> For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who come out against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:40">18:40</a> By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:41">18:41</a> They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:42">18:42</a> Then they were crushed as small as dust before the wind; they were drained out like the waste of the streets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:43">18:43</a> You have made me free from the fightings of the people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:44">18:44</a> From the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me: men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:45">18:45</a> They will be wasting away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:46">18:46</a> The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:47">18:47</a> It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:48">18:48</a> He makes me free from my haters; I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:49">18:49</a> Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:3">44:3</a> For they did not make the land theirs by their swords, and it was not their arms which kept them safe; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you had pleasure in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:4">44:4</a> You are my King and my God; ordering salvation for Jacob.</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:22">44:22</a> Truly, because of you we are put to death every day; we are numbered like sheep for destruction.</p>

 <p><a name="an_73:2">73:2</a> But as for me, my feet had almost gone from under me; I was near to slipping;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:3">73:3</a> Because of my envy of the men of pride, when I saw the well-being of the wrongdoers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:4">73:4</a> For they have no pain; their bodies are fat and strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:5">73:5</a> They are not in trouble as others are; they have no part in the unhappy fate of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:6">73:6</a> For this reason pride is round them like a chain; they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:7">73:7</a> Their eyes are bursting with fat; they have more than their heart's desire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:8">73:8</a> Their thoughts are deep with evil designs; their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:9">73:9</a> Their mouth goes up to heaven; their tongues go walking through the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:10">73:10</a> For this reason they are full of bread; and water is ever flowing for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:11">73:11</a> And they say, How will the Lord see this? is there knowledge in the Most High?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:12">73:12</a> Truly, such are the sinners; they do well at all times, and their wealth is increased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:13">73:13</a> As for me, I have made my heart clean to no purpose, washing my hands in righteousness;</p>

 <p><a name="an_73:15">73:15</a> If I would make clear what it is like, I would say, You are false to the generation of your children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:16">73:16</a> When my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this, it was a weariness in my eyes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:17">73:17</a> Till I went into God's holy place, and saw the end of the evil-doers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:18">73:18</a> You put their feet where there was danger of slipping, so that they go down into destruction.</p>

 <p><a name="an_73:22">73:22</a> As for me, I was foolish, and without knowledge; I was like a beast before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_73:23">73:23</a> But still I am ever with you; you have taken me by my right hand.</p>

 <p><a name="an_74:4">74:4</a> Sending out their voices like lions among your worshippers; they have put up their signs to be seen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:5">74:5</a> They are cutting down, like a man whose blade is lifted up against the thick trees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:6">74:6</a> Your doors are broken down with hammers and iron blades.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:7">74:7</a> They have put on fire your holy place; they have made the place of your name unclean, pulling it down to the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:8">74:8</a> They have said in their hearts, Let us put an end to them all together; they have given over to the fire all God's places of worship in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:9">74:9</a> We do not see our signs: there is no longer any prophet, or anyone among us to say how long.</p>

 <p><a name="an_74:14">74:14</a> The heads of the great snake were crushed by you; you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:15">74:15</a> You made valleys for fountains and springs; you made the ever-flowing rivers dry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:16">74:16</a> The day is yours and the night is yours: you made the light and the sun.</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:1">78:1</a> &lt;Maschil. Of Asaph.&gt; Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth.</p>

 <p><a name="an_78:3">78:3</a> Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:4">78:4</a> We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:5">78:5</a> He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:6">78:6</a> So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:7">78:7</a> So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God's works go out of their minds, but keep his laws;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:8">78:8</a> And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:9">78:9</a> The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:10">78:10</a> They were not ruled by God's word, and they would not go in the way of his law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:11">78:11</a> They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:12">78:12</a> He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:13">78:13</a> The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:14">78:14</a> In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:15">78:15</a> The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:16">78:16</a> He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:17">78:17</a> And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:18">78:18</a> Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:19">78:19</a> They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:20">78:20</a> See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:21">78:21</a> So these things came to the Lord's ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:22">78:22</a> Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:23">78:23</a> And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:24">78:24</a> And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:25">78:25</a> Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:26">78:26</a> He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:27">78:27</a> He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:28">78:28</a> And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:29">78:29</a> So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:30">78:30</a> But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:31">78:31</a> The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:32">78:32</a> For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:33">78:33</a> So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:34">78:34</a> When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:35">78:35</a> In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:36">78:36</a> But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:37">78:37</a> And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:38">78:38</a> But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:39">78:39</a> So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:40">78:40</a> How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:41">78:41</a> Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:42">78:42</a> They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:43">78:43</a> How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:44">78:44</a> So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:45">78:45</a> He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:46">78:46</a> He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:47">78:47</a> He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:48">78:48</a> Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:49">78:49</a> He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:50">78:50</a> He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:51">78:51</a> He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:52">78:52</a> But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:53">78:53</a> He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:54">78:54</a> And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:55">78:55</a> Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:56">78:56</a> But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:57">78:57</a> Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:58">78:58</a> They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:59">78:59</a> When this came to God's ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:60">78:60</a> So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:61">78:61</a> And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:62">78:62</a> He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage.</p>

 <p><a name="an_106:9">106:9</a> By his word the Red Sea was made dry: and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:10">106:10</a> And he took them safely out of the hands of their haters, and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:11">106:11</a> And the waters went over their haters; all of them came to an end.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:12">106:12</a> Then they had faith in his words; they gave him songs of praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:13">106:13</a> But their memory of his works was short; not waiting to be guided by him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:14">106:14</a> They gave way to their evil desires in the waste land, and put God to the test in the dry places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:15">106:15</a> And he gave them their request, but sent a wasting disease into their souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:16">106:16</a> They were full of envy against Moses among the tents, and against Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:17">106:17</a> The earth opening put an end to Dathan, covering up Abiram and his band.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:18">106:18</a> And a fire was lighted among their tents; the sinners were burned up by the flames.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:19">106:19</a> They made a young ox in Horeb, and gave worship to an image of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:20">106:20</a> And their glory was changed into the image of an ox, whose food is grass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:21">106:21</a> They had no memory of God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:22">106:22</a> Works of wonder in the land of Ham, and things of fear by the Red Sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:23">106:23</a> And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses, his special servant, had not gone up before him, between him and his people, turning back his wrath, to keep them from destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:24">106:24</a> They were disgusted with the good land; they had no belief in his word;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:25">106:25</a> Talking against him secretly in their tents, they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:26">106:26</a> So he made an oath against them, to put an end to them in the waste land:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:27">106:27</a> That their children might be mixed among the nations, and sent away into other lands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:28">106:28</a> And they were joined to Baal-peor, and took part in the offerings to the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:29">106:29</a> So they made him angry by their behaviour; and he sent disease on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:30">106:30</a> Then Phinehas got up, and made prayer for them; and the disease went no farther.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:31">106:31</a> And all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:32">106:32</a> They made God angry again at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled because of them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:33">106:33</a> For they made his spirit bitter, and he said unwise things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:34">106:34</a> They did not put an end to the peoples, as the Lord had said;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:35">106:35</a> But they were joined to the nations, learning their works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:36">106:36</a> And they gave worship to images; which were a danger to them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:37">106:37</a> They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:38">106:38</a> And gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong, offering them to the images of Canaan; and the land was made unclean with blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:39">106:39</a> So they became unclean through their works, going after their evil desires.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:40">106:40</a> Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people, and he was angry with his heritage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:41">106:41</a> And he gave them into the hands of the nations; and they were ruled by their haters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:42">106:42</a> By them they were crushed, and made low under their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:43">106:43</a> Again and again he made them free; but their hearts were turned against his purpose, and they were overcome by their sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:44">106:44</a> But when their cry came to his ears, he had pity on their trouble:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:45">106:45</a> And kept in mind his agreement with them, and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:46">106:46</a> He put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:47">106:47</a> Be our saviour, O Lord our God, and let us come back together from among the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name, and have glory in your praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:48">106:48</a> Praise be to the Lord God of Israel for ever and for ever; and let all the people say, So be it. Give praise to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:1">107:1</a> O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:2">107:2</a> Let those whose cause the Lord has taken up say so, his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:3">107:3</a> Making them come together out of all the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:4">107:4</a> They were wandering in the waste places; they saw no way to a resting-place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:5">107:5</a> Their souls became feeble for need of food and drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:6">107:6</a> Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:7">107:7</a> Guiding them in the right way, so that they might come into the town of their resting-place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:8">107:8</a> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:9">107:9</a> He gives its desire to the unresting soul, so that it is full of good things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:10">107:10</a> Those who were in the dark, in the black night, in chains of sorrow and iron;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:11">107:11</a> Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:12">107:12</a> So that he made their hearts weighted down with grief; they were falling, and had no helper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:13">107:13</a> Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:14">107:14</a> He took them out of the dark and the black night, and all their chains were broken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:15">107:15</a> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!</p>

 <p><a name="an_107:19">107:19</a> Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:20">107:20</a> He sent his word and made them well, and kept them safe from the underworld.</p>

 <p><a name="an_107:23">107:23</a> Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters;</p>

 <p><a name="an_107:25">107:25</a> For at his word comes up the storm-wind, lifting high the waves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:26">107:26</a> The sailors go up to heaven, and down into the deep; their souls are wasted because of their trouble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_107:27">107:27</a> They are turned here and there, rolling like a man who is full of wine; and all their wisdom comes to nothing.</p>
