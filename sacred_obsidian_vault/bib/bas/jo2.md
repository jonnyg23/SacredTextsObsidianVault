  <h3 align="center">Basic English Bible: 2 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> I, a ruler in the church, send word to the noble sister who is of God's selection, and to her children, for whom I have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is true;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Because of this true knowledge which is in us, and will be with us for ever:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And now, my sister, I make a request to you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first, that we have love for one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And love is the keeping of his laws. This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> The children of your noble sister, who is of God's selection, send you their love.</p>
