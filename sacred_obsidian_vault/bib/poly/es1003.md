 <p align="center"><a href="../apo/es1003.htm">Apo</a></p><p>1 Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia, </p>
 <p>2 And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces. </p>
 <p>3 And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked. </p>
 <p>4 Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another; </p>
 <p>5 Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory: </p>
 <p>6 As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck: </p>
 <p>7 And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin. </p>
 <p>8 And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow; </p>
 <p>9 And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed. </p>
 <p>10 The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. </p>
 <p>11 The second wrote, The king is strongest. </p>
 <p>12 The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory. </p>
 <p>13 Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them: </p>
 <p>14 And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers; </p>
 <p>15 And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them. </p>
 <p>16 And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in. </p>
 <p>17 And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine; </p>
 <p>18 And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it: </p>
 <p>19 It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich: </p>
 <p>20 It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt: </p>
 <p>21 And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents: </p>
 <p>22 And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords: </p>
 <p>23 But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done. </p>
 <p>24 O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace. </p>

 <p>2 καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς σατράπαις καὶ στρατηγοῖς καὶ τοπάρχαις τοῖς ὑπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς μέχρι τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ἐν ταῖς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι ἑπτὰ σατραπείαις </p>
 <p>3 καὶ ἐφάγοσαν καὶ ἐπίοσαν καὶ ἐμπλησθέντες ἀνέλυσαν ὁ δὲ Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀνέλυσεν εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα καὶ ἐκοιμήθη καὶ ἔξυπνος ἐγένετο </p>
 <p>4 τότε οἱ τρεῖς νεανίσκοι οἱ σωματοφύλακες οἱ φυλάσσοντες τὸ σῶμα τοῦ βασιλέως εἶπαν ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον </p>
 <p>5 εἴπωμεν ἕκαστος ἡμῶν ἕνα λόγον ὃς ὑπερισχύσει καὶ οὗ ἂν φανῇ τὸ ῥῆμα αὐτοῦ σοφώτερον τοῦ ἑτέρου δώσει αὐτῷ Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς δωρεὰς μεγάλας καὶ ἐπινίκια μεγάλα </p>
 <p>6 καὶ πορφύραν περιβαλέσθαι καὶ ἐν χρυσώμασιν πίνειν καὶ ἐπὶ χρυσῷ καθεύδειν καὶ ἅρμα χρυσοχάλινον καὶ κίδαριν βυσσίνην καὶ μανιάκην περὶ τὸν τράχηλον </p>
 <p>7 καὶ δεύτερος καθιεῖται Δαρείου διὰ τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ συγγενὴς Δαρείου κληθήσεται </p>
 <p>8 καὶ τότε γράψαντες ἕκαστος τὸν ἑαυτοῦ λόγον ἐσφραγίσαντο καὶ ἔθηκαν ὑπὸ τὸ προσκεφάλαιον Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ εἶπαν </p>
 <p>9 ὅταν ἐγερθῇ ὁ βασιλεύς δώσουσιν αὐτῷ τὸ γράμμα καὶ ὃν ἂν κρίνῃ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ τρεῖς μεγιστᾶνες τῆς Περσίδος ὅτι ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ σοφώτερος αὐτῷ δοθήσεται τὸ νῖκος καθὼς γέγραπται </p>
 <p>10 ὁ εἷς ἔγραψεν ὑπερισχύει ὁ οἶνος </p>
 <p>11 ὁ ἕτερος ἔγραψεν ὑπερισχύει ὁ βασιλεύς </p>
 <p>12 ὁ τρίτος ἔγραψεν ὑπερισχύουσιν αἱ γυναῖκες ὑπὲρ δὲ πάντα νικᾷ ἡ ἀλήθεια </p>
 <p>13 καὶ ὅτε ἐξηγέρθη ὁ βασιλεύς λαβόντες τὸ γράμμα ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ καὶ ἀνέγνω </p>
 <p>14 καὶ ἐξαποστείλας ἐκάλεσεν πάντας τοὺς μεγιστᾶνας τῆς Περσίδος καὶ τῆς Μηδίας καὶ σατράπας καὶ στρατηγοὺς καὶ τοπάρχας καὶ ὑπάτους καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῷ χρηματιστηρίῳ καὶ ἀνεγνώσθη τὸ γράμμα ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν </p>
 <p>15 καὶ εἶπεν καλέσατε τοὺς νεανίσκους καὶ αὐτοὶ δηλώσουσιν τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκλήθησαν καὶ εἰσήλθοσαν </p>
 <p>16 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς ἀπαγγείλατε ἡμῖν περὶ τῶν γεγραμμένων </p>
 <p>17 καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ πρῶτος ὁ εἴπας περὶ τῆς ἰσχύος τοῦ οἴνου καὶ ἔφη οὕτως </p>
 <p>18 ἄνδρες πῶς ὑπερισχύει ὁ οἶνος πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς πίνοντας αὐτὸν πλανᾷ τὴν διάνοιαν </p>
 <p>19 τοῦ τε βασιλέως καὶ τοῦ ὀρφανοῦ ποιεῖ τὴν διάνοιαν μίαν τήν τε τοῦ οἰκέτου καὶ τὴν τοῦ ἐλευθέρου τήν τε τοῦ πένητος καὶ τὴν τοῦ πλουσίου </p>
 <p>20 καὶ πᾶσαν διάνοιαν μεταστρέφει εἰς εὐωχίαν καὶ εὐφροσύνην καὶ οὐ μέμνηται πᾶσαν λύπην καὶ πᾶν ὀφείλημα </p>
 <p>21 καὶ πάσας καρδίας ποιεῖ πλουσίας καὶ οὐ μέμνηται βασιλέα οὐδὲ σατράπην καὶ πάντα διὰ ταλάντων ποιεῖ λαλεῖν </p>
 <p>22 καὶ οὐ μέμνηται ὅταν πίνωσιν φιλιάζειν φίλοις καὶ ἀδελφοῖς καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ σπῶνται μαχαίρας </p>
 <p>23 καὶ ὅταν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου γενηθῶσιν οὐ μέμνηται ἃ ἔπραξαν </p>
 <p>24 ὦ ἄνδρες οὐχ ὑπερισχύει ὁ οἶνος ὅτι οὕτως ἀναγκάζει ποιεῖν καὶ ἐσίγησεν οὕτως εἴπας </p>
