 <p align="CENTER">LXII. <i>Judgement of the Kings and the Mighty: Blessedness of the Righteous</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER LXII.</h3> 
 <p>1. And thus the Lord commanded the kings and the mighty and the exalted, and those who dwell on the earth, and said: 'Open your eyes and lift up your horns if ye are able to recognize the Elect One.'</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>2. And the Lord of Spirits seated him on the throne of His glory,<br> And the spirit of righteousness was poured out upon him,<br> And the word of his mouth slays all the sinners,<br> And all the unrighteous are destroyed from before his face.<br> 3. And there shall stand up in that day all the kings and the mighty,<br> And the exalted and those who hold the earth,<br> And they shall see and recognize How he sits on the throne of his glory,<br> And righteousness is judged before him,<br> And no lying word is spoken before him.</p> 
 <p>4. Then shall pain come upon them as on a woman in travail,<br> <font color="GREEN">[</font>And she has pain in bringing forth<font color="GREEN">]</font><br> When her child enters the mouth of the womb,<br> And she has pain in bringing forth.</p> 
 <p>5. And one portion of them shall look on the other,<br> And they shall be terrified,<br> And they shall be downcast of countenance,<br> And pain shall seize them,<br> When they see that Son of Man Sitting on the throne of his glory.</p></dir> </dir>

 <p>6. And the kings and the mighty and all who possess the earth shall bless and glorify and extol him who rules over all, who was hidden.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>7. For from the beginning the Son of Man was hidden,<br> And the Most High preserved him in the presence of His might,<br> And revealed him to the elect.</p> 
 <p>8. And the congregation of the elect and holy shall be sown,<br> And all the elect shall stand before him on that day.</p> 
 <p>9. And all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who rule the earth<br> Shall fall down before him on their faces,<br> And worship and set their hope upon that Son of Man,<br> And petition him and supplicate for mercy at his hands.</p> 
 <p>10. Nevertheless that Lord of Spirits will so press them<br> That they shall hastily go forth from His presence,<br> And their faces shall be filled with shame,<br> And the darkness grow deeper on their faces.<br> 11. And <b>He will deliver</b> them to the angels for punishment,<br> To execute vengeance on them because they have oppressed His children and His elect<br> 12. And they shall be a spectacle for the righteous and for His elect:<br> They shall rejoice over them,<br> Because the wrath of the Lord of Spirits resteth upon them,<br> And His sword is drunk with their blood.<br> 13. And the righteous and elect shall be saved on that day,<br> And they shall never thenceforward see the face of the sinners and unrighteous. <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a></p> 
 <p>14. And the Lord of Spirits will abide over them,<br> And with that Son of Man shall they eat<br> And lie down and rise up for ever and ever.</p> 
 <p>15. And the righteous and elect shall have risen from the earth,<br> And ceased to be of downcast countenance.</p> 
 <p>And they shall have been clothed with garments of glory,<br> 16. And these shall be the garments of life from the Lord of Spirits:<br> And your garments shall not grow old,<br> Nor your glory pass away before the Lord of Spirits.</p>
