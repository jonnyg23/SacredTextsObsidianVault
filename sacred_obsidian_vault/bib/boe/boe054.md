 <p>1. And in those days shall the earth also give back that which has been entrusted to it,<br> And Sheol also shall give back that which it has received,<br> And hell shall give back that which it owes.</p> 
 <p>5<i>a</i>. For in those days the Elect One shall arise,<br> 2. And he shall choose the righteous and holy from among them:<br> For the day has drawn nigh that they should be saved.</p> 
 <p>3. And the Elect One shall in those days sit on My throne,<br> And his mouth shall <b>pour</b> forth all the secrets of wisdom and counsel:<br> For the Lord of Spirits hath given (them) to him and hath glorified him.</p> 
 <p>4. And in those days shall the mountains leap like rams,<br> And the hills also shall skip like lambs satisfied with milk,<br> And the faces of <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>all<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> the angels in heaven shall be lighted up with joy.</p> 
 <p>5<i>b</i>. And the earth shall rejoice,<br> <i>c</i>. And the righteous shall dwell upon it,<br> <i>d</i>. And the elect shall walk thereon.</p></dir> </dir>
