 <p align="CENTER">XCIX. <i>Woes pronounced on the Godless, the Lawbreakers: evil Plight of Sinners in the last Days: further Woes</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XCIX.</h3><dir> <dir>  
 <p>1. Woe to you who work godlessness,<br> And glory in lying and extol them:<br> Ye shall perish, and no happy life shall be yours.</p> 
 <p>2. Woe to them who pervert the words of uprightness,<br> And transgress the eternal law,<br> And transform themselves into what they were not <font color="GREEN">[</font>into sinners<font color="GREEN">]</font>:<br> They shall be trodden under foot upon the earth.</p> 
 <p>3. In those days make ready, ye righteous, to raise your prayers as <b>a</b> memorial,<br> And place them as a testimony before the angels,<br> That they may place the sin of the sinners for a memorial before the Most High.</p> 
 <p>4. In those days the nations shall be stirred up,<br> And the families of the nations shall arise on the day of destruction.</p> 
 <p>5. And in those days the destitute shall go forth and carry off their children,<br> And they shall abandon them, so that their children shall perish through them:<br> Yea, they shall abandon their children (that are still) sucklings, and not return to them,<br> And shall have no pity on their beloved ones.</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>6. And again I swear to you, ye sinners, that sin is prepared for a day of unceasing bloodshed. 7. And they who worship stones, and grave images of gold</p> 
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a></p> 
 <p>and silver and wood <font color="GREEN">〈</font>and stone<font color="GREEN">〉</font> and clay, and those who worship impure spirits and demons, and all kinds of idols not according to knowledge, shall get no manner of help from them.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>8. And they shall become godless by reason of the folly of their hearts,<br> And their eyes shall be blinded through the fear of their hearts<br> And through visions in their dreams.<br> 9. Through these they shall become godless and fearful;<br> For they shall have wrought all their work in a lie,<br> And shall have worshiped a stone:<br> Therefore in an instant shall they perish.</p> 
 <p>10. But in those days blessed are all they who accept the words of wisdom, and understand them,<br> And observe the paths of the Most High, and walk in the path of His righteousness,<br> And become not godless with the godless;<br> For they shall be saved.</p> 
 <p>11. Woe to you who spread evil to your neighbours;<br> For you shall be slain in Sheol.<br> 12. Woe to you who make deceitful and false measures,<br> And (to them) who cause bitterness on the earth;<br> For they shall thereby be utterly consumed.</p> 
 <p>13. Woe to you who build your houses through the grievous toil of others,<br> And all their building materials are the bricks and stones of sin;<br> I tell you ye shall have no peace.</p> 
 <p>14. Woe to them who reject the measure and eternal heritage of their fathers<br> And whose souls follow after idols;<br> For they shall have no rest.</p> 
 <p>15. Woe to them who work unrighteousness and help oppression, <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></a><br> And slay their neighbours until the day of the great judgement.</p> 
 <p>16. For He shall cast down your glory,<br> And bring affliction on your hearts,<br> And shall arouse <b>His fierce indignation</b>,<br> And destroy you all with the sword;<br> And all the holy and righteous shall remember your sins.</p>
