 <p>1. Be hopeful, ye righteous; for suddenly shall the sinners perish before you,<br> And ye shall have lordship over them according to your desires.</p> 
 <p><font color="GREEN">[</font>2. And in the day of the tribulation of the sinners,<br> Your children shall mount and rise as eagles,<br> And higher than the vultures will be your nest,<br> And ye shall ascend and enter the crevices of the earth,<br> And the clefts of the rock for ever as coneys before the unrighteous,<br> And the sirens shall sigh because of you-and weep.<font color="GREEN">]</font></p> 
 <p>3. Wherefore fear not, ye that have suffered;<br> For healing shall be your portion,<br> And a bright light shall enlighten you,<br> And the voice of rest ye shall hear from heaven.</p> 
 <p>4. Woe unto you, ye sinners, for your riches make you appear like the righteous,<br> But your hearts convict you of being sinners,<br> And this fact shall be a testimony against you for a memorial of (your) evil deeds.</p> 
 <p>5. Woe to you who devour the finest of the wheat,<br> And drink <b>wine in large bowls</b>,<br> And tread under foot the lowly with your might.</p> 
 <p>6. Woe to you who drink water <b>from every fountain</b>,<br> For suddenly shall ye be consumed and wither away,<br> Because ye have forsaken the fountain of life.</p> 
 <p>7. Woe to you who work unrighteousness<br> And deceit and blasphemy:<br> It shall be a memorial against you for evil.</p> 
 <p>8. Woe to you, ye mighty,<br> Who with might oppress the righteous;<br> For the day of your destruction is coming. <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a><br> In those days many and good days shall come to the righteous--in the day of your judgement.</p>
