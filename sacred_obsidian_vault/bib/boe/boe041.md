 <p>1. The First Parable.<br> When the congregation of the righteous shall appear,<br> And sinners shall be judged for their sins,<br> And shall be driven from the face of the earth:</p> 
 <p>2. And when the Righteous One shall appear before the eyes of the righteous,<br> Whose elect works hang upon the Lord of Spirits,<br> And light shall appear to the righteous and the elect who dwell on the earth, <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a><br> Where then will be the dwelling of the sinners,<br> And where the resting-place of those who have denied the Lord of Spirits?<br> It had been good for them if they had not been born.</p> 
 <p>3. When the secrets of the righteous shall be revealed and the sinners judged,<br> And the godless driven from the presence of the righteous and elect,<br> 4. From that time those that possess the earth shall no longer be powerful and exalted:</p> 
 <p>And they shall not be able to behold the face of the holy,<br> For the Lord of Spirits has <b>caused His light to appear</b><br> On the face of the holy, righteous, and elect.</p> 
 <p>5. Then shall the kings and the mighty perish<br> And be given into the hands of the righteous and holy.<br> 6. And thenceforward none shall seek for themselves mercy from the Lord of Spirits<br> For their life is at an end.</p>
