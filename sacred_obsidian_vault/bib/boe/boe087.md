 <p>1. And I lifted up my hands in righteousness and blessed the Holy and Great One, and spake with the breath of my mouth, and with the</p> 
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p> 
 <p>tongue of flesh, which God has made for the children of the flesh of men, that they should speak therewith, and He gave them breath and a tongue and a mouth that they should speak therewith:</p> 
 <p>2. 'Blessed be Thou, O Lord, King,<br> Great and mighty in Thy greatness,<br> Lord of the whole creation of the heaven,<br> King of kings and God of the whole world.</p> 
 <p>And Thy power and kingship and greatness abide for ever and ever,<br> And throughout all generations Thy dominion;<br> And all the heavens are Thy throne for ever,<br> And the whole earth Thy footstool for ever and ever.</p> 
 <p>3. For Thou hast made and Thou rulest all things,<br> And nothing is too hard for Thee,<br> Wisdom departs not <b>from the place of Thy throne</b>,<br> <b>Nor turns away</b> from Thy presence.<br> And Thou knowest and seest and hearest everything,<br> And there is nothing hidden from Thee <font color="GREEN">[</font>for Thou seest everything<font color="GREEN">]</font>.<br> 4. And now the angels of Thy heavens are guilty of trespass,<br> And upon the flesh of men abideth Thy wrath until the great day of judgement.<br> 5. And now, O God and Lord and Great King,<br> I implore and beseech Thee to fulfil my prayer,<br> To leave me a posterity on earth,<br> And not destroy all the flesh of man,<br> And make the earth without inhabitant,<br> So that there should be an eternal destruction.<br> 6. And now, my Lord, destroy from the earth the flesh which has aroused Thy wrath,<br> But the flesh of righteousness and uprightness establish as a plant of the eternal seed,<br> And hide not Thy face from the prayer of Thy servant, O Lord.'</p>
