 <p>1. The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>and<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> righteous, who will be living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>and godless<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> are to be removed. 2. And he took up his parable and said--Enoch a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>which<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is for to come. 3. Concerning the elect I said, and took up my parable concerning them:</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling,<br> 4. And the eternal God will tread upon the earth, (even) on Mount Sinai,<br> <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>And appear from His camp<font color="GREEN">⌉</font><br> And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven of heavens.</p> 
 <p>5. And all shall be smitten with fear<br> And the Watchers shall quake,<br> And great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth.</p> 
 <p>6. And the high mountains shall be shaken,<br> And the high hills shall be made low,<br> And shall melt like wax before the flame <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p> 
 <p>7. And the earth shall be <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>wholly<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> rent in sunder,<br> And all that is upon the earth shall perish,<br> And there shall be a judgement upon all (men).</p> 
 <p>8. But with the righteous He will make peace.</p> 
 <p>And will protect the elect,<br> And mercy shall be upon them.</p> 
 <p>And they shall all belong to God,<br> And they shall be prospered,<br> And they shall <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>all<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> be blessed.</p> 
 <p><font color="GREEN">⌈</font>And He will help them all<font color="GREEN">⌉</font>,<br> And light shall appear unto them,<br> <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>And He will make peace with them<font color="GREEN">⌉</font>.</p> 
 <p>9. And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>His<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> holy ones<br> To execute judgement upon all,<br> And to destroy <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>all<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> the ungodly:</p> 
 <p>And to convict all flesh<br> Of all the works <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>of their ungodliness<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> which they have ungodly committed,<br> And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>have spoken<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> against Him.</p></dir> </dir>
