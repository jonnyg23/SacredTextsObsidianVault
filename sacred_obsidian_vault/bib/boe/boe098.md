 <p>1. And now I say unto you, my sons, love righteousness and walk therein;<br> For the paths of righteousness are worthy of acceptation,<br> But the paths of unrighteousness shall suddenly be destroyed and vanish.</p> 
 <p>2. And to certain men of a generation shall the paths of violence and of death be revealed,<br> And they shall hold themselves afar from them,<br> And shall not follow them. <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></a></p> 
 <p>3. And now I say unto you the righteous:<br> Walk not in the paths of wickedness, nor in the paths of death,<br> And draw not nigh to them, lest ye be destroyed.</p> 
 <p>4. But seek and choose for yourselves righteousness and an elect life,<br> And walk in the paths of peace,<br> And ye shall live and prosper.</p> 
 <p>5. And hold fast my words in the thoughts of your hearts,<br> And suffer them not to be effaced from your hearts;</p> 
 <p>For I know that sinners will tempt men to <b>evilly-entreat</b> wisdom,<br> So that no place may be found for her,<br> And no manner of temptation may minish.</p></dir> </dir>

 <p>6. Woe to those who build unrighteousness and oppression<br> And lay deceit as a foundation;<br> For they shall be suddenly overthrown,<br> And they shall have no peace.</p> 
 <p>7. Woe to those who build their houses with sin;<br> For from all their foundations shall they be overthrown,<br> And by the sword shall they fall.</p> 
 <p><font color="GREEN">[</font>And those who acquire gold and silver in judgement suddenly shall perish.<font color="GREEN">]</font></p> 
 <p>8. Woe to you, ye rich, for ye have trusted in your riches,<br> And from your riches shall ye depart,<br> Because ye have not remembered the Most High in the days of your riches.</p> 
 <p>9. Ye have committed blasphemy and unrighteousness,<br> And have become ready for the day of slaughter, <a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></a><br> And the day of darkness and the day of the great judgement.</p> 
 <p>10. Thus I speak and declare unto you:<br> He who hath created you will overthrow you,<br> And for your fall there shall be no compassion,<br> And your Creator will rejoice at your destruction.</p> 
 <p>11. And your righteous ones in those days shall be<br> A reproach to the sinners and the godless.</p>
