 <p align="CENTER">XXIV. XXV. <i>The Seven Mountains in the North-West and the Tree of Life</i>.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XXIV.</h3> 
 <p>1. <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>And from thence I went to another place of the earth<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font>, and he showed me a mountain range of fire which burnt <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>day and night<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font>. 2. And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>three towards<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> the east, <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>one<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other. 3. And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne. 4. And amongst them was a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: and its fruit <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>is beautiful, and its fruit<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> resembles the dates of a palm. 5. Then I said: '<font color="GREEN">⌈</font>How<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>very<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> delightful in appearance.' 6. Then answered Michael, one of the holy <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>and honoured<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> angels who was with me, and was their leader.</p>
