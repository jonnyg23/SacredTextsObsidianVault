And it shall come to pass in those days that none shall be saved,<br> Either by gold or by silver,<br> And none be able to escape.<br> 8 And there shall be no iron for war,<br> Nor shall one clothe oneself with a breastplate.<br> Bronze shall be of no service,<br> And tin <font color="GREEN">[</font>shall be of no service and<font color="GREEN">]</font> shall not be esteemed,<br> And lead shall not be desired.<br> 9 And all these things shall be <font color="GREEN">[</font>denied and<font color="GREEN">]</font> destroyed from the surface of the earth,<br> When the Elect One shall appear before the face of the Lord of Spirits.'</p>
