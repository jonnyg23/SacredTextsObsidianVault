 <p>1. And I went from thence to the middle of the earth, and I saw a blessed place <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>in which there were trees<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> with branches abiding and blooming <font color="GREEN">[</font>of a dismembered tree<font color="GREEN">]</font>. 2. And there I saw a holy mountain, <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>and<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> underneath the mountain to the east there was a stream and it flowed towards the south. 3. And I saw towards the east another mountain higher than this, and between them a deep and narrow ravine: in it also ran a stream <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>underneath<font color="GREEN">⌉</font> the mountain. 4. And to the west thereof there was another mountain, lower than the former and of small elevation, and a ravine <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>deep and dry<font color="GREEN">⌉</font></p>

 <p>between them: and another deep and dry ravine was at the extremities of the three <font color="GREEN">⌈</font>mountains<font color="GREEN">⌉</font>. 5. And all the ravines were deep <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>and narrow<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font>, (being formed) of hard rock, and trees were not planted upon them. 6. And I marveled <font color="GREEN">⌈⌈</font>at the rocks, and I marveled<font color="GREEN">⌉⌉</font> at the ravine, yea, I marveled very much.</p>
