 <p>1. And after that he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and let loose all the powers of the waters which are beneath in the earth in order to bring judgement and destruction on all who <font color="GREEN">[</font>abide and<font color="GREEN">]</font> dwell on the earth. 2. And the Lord of Spirits gave commandment to the angels who were going forth, that they should not cause <b>the waters</b> to rise but should hold them in check; for those angels were over the powers of the waters. 3. And I went away from the presence of Enoch.</p>
