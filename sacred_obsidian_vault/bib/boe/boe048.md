 <p>1. And this is the Second Parable concerning those who deny the name of the dwelling of the holy ones and the Lord of Spirits.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>2. And into the heaven they shall not ascend,<br> And on the earth they shall not come:<br> Such shall be the lot of the sinners<br> Who have denied the name of the Lord of Spirits,<br> Who are thus preserved for the day of suffering and tribulation.<a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a></p> 
 <p>3. On that day Mine Elect One shall sit on the throne of glory<br> And shall <b>try</b> their works,<br> And their places of rest shall be innumerable.</p> 
 <p>And their souls shall grow strong within them when they see Mine Elect Ones,<br> And those who have called upon My glorious name:<br> 4. Then will I cause Mine Elect One to dwell among them.</p> 
 <p>And I will transform the heaven and make it an eternal blessing and light<br> 5. And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing:</p> 
 <p>And I will cause Mine elect ones to dwell upon it:<br> But the sinners and evil-doers shall not set foot thereon.</p> 
 <p>6. For I have provided and satisfied with peace My righteous ones<br> And have caused them to dwell before Me:</p> 
 <p>But for the sinners there is judgement impending with Me,<br> So that I shall destroy them from the face of the earth.</p>
