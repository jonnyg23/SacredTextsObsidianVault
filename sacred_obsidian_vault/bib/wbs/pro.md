  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: Proverbs</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> For they shalt be an ornament of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; who taketh away the life of its owners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and rejected my reproof: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> But whoever hearkeneth to me shall dwell in safety, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> So that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Yes, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; and every good path. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger who flattereth with her words; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> For her house inclineth to death, and her paths to the dead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> None that go to her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of it than fine gold. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> My son, let not them depart from thy eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> So shall they be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: but thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> Say not to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> Strive not with a man without cause, if he hath done thee no harm. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:33">3:33</a> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:34">3:34</a> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace to the lowly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:35">3:35</a> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> He taught me also, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> My son, attend to my words; incline thy ear to my sayings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Let them not depart from thy eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> For they are life to those that find them, and health to all their flesh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> Let thy eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow thy ear to my understanding: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the house of a stranger; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> My son, if thou art surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Give not sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Provideth her provisions in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> These six things doth the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> A false witness that speaketh lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Bind them continually upon thy heart, and tie them about thy neck. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> For by means of a lewd woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; whoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> Men do not despise a thief, if he stealeth to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:31">6:31</a> But if he is found, he shall restore seven-fold; he shall give all the substance of his house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:32">6:32</a> But whoever committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:33">6:33</a> A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:34">6:34</a> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:35">6:35</a> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: </p>

 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understandeth, he will not answer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him at length become his son. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> A man's pride shall bring him low: but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> Whoever is partner with a thief, hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and discloseth it not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> The fear of man bringeth a snare: but he who putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> Many seek the ruler's favor; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> Who hath ascended into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> Every word of God is pure: he is a shield to them that put their trust in him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> Add thou not to his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> Two things have I required of thee; deny them not to me before I die: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw-teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> The horse-leech hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yes, four things say not, It is enough: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> The eye that mocketh at its father, and despiseth to obey its mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yes, four which I know not: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with food. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> For an odious woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are very wise: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> The conies are but a feeble people, yet they make their houses in the rocks; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:28">30:28</a> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in king's palaces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> There are three things which go well, yes, four are comely in going: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> A lion, which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> A greyhound; a he-goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:32">30:32</a> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:33">30:33</a> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that are of heavy hearts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> She is like the merchant's ships; she bringeth her food from afar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and a portion to her maidens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yes, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles to the merchant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and on her tongue is the law of kindness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. </p>
