  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: 3 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Who have borne testimony of thy charity before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou wilt do well: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Demetrius hath good report by all men, and by the truth itself: and we also bear testimony; and ye know that our testimony is true. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. </p>
