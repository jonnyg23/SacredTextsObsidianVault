 <p><a name="000"><b>Zatthu</b></a>     A sprout, <a href="../kjv/neh010.htm#014">Neh 10:14</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Zattu</b></a>     Id., one whose descendants returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel (<a href="../kjv/ezr002.htm#008">Ezr 2:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh007.htm#013">Neh 7:13</a>); probably the same as Zatthu. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Zaza</b></a>     Plenty, a descendant of Judah (<a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#033">Ch1 2:33</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Zeal</b></a>     An earnest temper; may be enlightened (<a href="../kjv/num025.htm#011">Num 25:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/co2007.htm#011">Co2 7:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/co2009.htm#002">Co2 9:2</a>), or ignorant and misdirected (<a href="../kjv/rom010.htm#002">Rom 10:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/phi003.htm#006">Phi 3:6</a>). As a Christian grace, it must be grounded on right principles and directed to right ends (<a href="../kjv/gal004.htm#018">Gal 4:18</a>). It is sometimes ascribed to God (<a href="../kjv/kg2019.htm#031">Kg2 19:31</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa037.htm#032">Isa 37:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze005.htm#013">Eze 5:13</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Zealots</b></a>     A sect of Jews which originated with Judas the Gaulonite (<a href="../kjv/act005.htm#037">Act 5:37</a>). They refused to pay tribute to the Romans, on the ground that this was a violation of the principle that God was the only king of Israel. They rebelled against the Romans, but were soon scattered, and became a lawless band of mere brigands. They were afterwards called Sicarii, from their use of the sica, i.e., the Roman dagger. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Zebadiah</b></a>     Gift of Jehovah.     (1.) A son of Asahel, Joab's brother (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#007">Ch1 27:7</a>). (2.) A Levite who took part as one of the teachers in the system of national education instituted by Jehoshaphat (<a href="../kjv/ch2017.htm#007">Ch2 17:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch2017.htm#008">Ch2 17:8</a>). (3.) The son of Ishmael, "the ruler of the house of Judah in all the king's matters" (<a href="../kjv/ch2019.htm#008">Ch2 19:8</a>). (4.) A son of Beriah (<a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#015">Ch1 8:15</a>). (5.) A Korhite porter of the Lord's house (<a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#002">Ch1 26:2</a>). Three or four others of this name are also mentioned. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Zebah</b></a>     Man-killer, or sacrifice, one of the two kings who led the vast host of the Midianites who invaded the land of Israel, and over whom Gideon gained a great and decisive victory (Judg. 8). Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The kings were taken alive and brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally taken part in the slaughter of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death (compare <a href="../kjv/sa1012.htm#011">Sa1 12:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa010.htm#026">Isa 10:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa083.htm#011">Psa 83:11</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Zebaim</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/ezr002.htm#057">Ezr 2:57</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh007.htm#059">Neh 7:59</a>). "Pochereth of Zebaim" should be read as in the Revised Version, "Pochereth-hazzebaim" ("snaring the antelopes"), probably the name of some hunter. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Zebedee</b></a>     A Galilean fisherman, the husband of Salome (q.v.), and the father of James and John, two of our Lord's disciples (<a href="../kjv/mat004.htm#021">Mat 4:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#056">Mat 27:56</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar015.htm#040">Mar 15:40</a>). He seems to have been a man of some position in Capernaum, for he had two boats (<a href="../kjv/luk005.htm#004">Luk 5:4</a>) and "hired servants" (<a href="../kjv/mar001.htm#020">Mar 1:20</a>) of his own. No mention is made of him after the call of his two sons by Jesus. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Zeboim</b></a>     Gazelles or roes.     (1.) One of the "five cities of the plain" of Sodom, generally coupled with Admah (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#019">Gen 10:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen014.htm#002">Gen 14:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu029.htm#023">Deu 29:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/hos011.htm#008">Hos 11:8</a>). It had a king of its own (Shemeber), and was therefore a place of some importance. It was destroyed along with the other cities of the plain. (2.) A valley or rugged glen somewhere near Gibeah in Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/sa1013.htm#018">Sa1 13:18</a>). It was probably the ravine now bearing the name Wady  Shakh-ed-Dub'a , or "ravine of the hyena," north of Jericho. (3.) A place mentioned only in <a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#034">Neh 11:34</a>, inhabited by the Benjamites after the Captivity.
