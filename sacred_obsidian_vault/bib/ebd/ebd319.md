 <p><a name="000"><b>Salcah</b></a>     Wandering, a city of Bashan assigned to the half tribe of Manasseh (<a href="../kjv/deu003.htm#010">Deu 3:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos012.htm#005">Jos 12:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#011">Jos 13:11</a>), identified with Salkhad, about 56 miles east of Jordan. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Salem</b></a>     Peace, commonly supposed to be another name of Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/gen014.htm#018">Gen 14:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa076.htm#002">Psa 76:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb007.htm#001">Heb 7:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/heb007.htm#002">Heb 7:2</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Salim</b></a>     Peaceful, a place near Aenon (q.v.), on the west of Jordan, where John baptized (<a href="../kjv/joh003.htm#023">Joh 3:23</a>). It was probably the Shalem mentioned in <a href="../kjv/gen033.htm#018">Gen 33:18</a>, about 7 miles south of Aenon, at the head of the great Wady  Far'ah , which formed the northern boundary of Judea in the Jordan valley. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Sallai</b></a>     Basket-maker.     (1.) A Benjamite (<a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#008">Neh 11:8</a>). (2.) A priest in the days of Joshua and Zerubbabel (<a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#020">Neh 12:20</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Sallu</b></a>     Weighed.     (1.) A priest (<a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#007">Neh 12:7</a>). (2.) A Benjamite (<a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#007">Ch1 9:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#007">Neh 11:7</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Salmon</b></a>      (1.)Garment, the son of Nashon (<a href="../kjv/rut004.htm#020">Rut 4:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#004">Mat 1:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</a>), possibly the same as Salma in <a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#051">Ch1 2:51</a>. (2.) Shady; or Zalmon (q.v.), a hill covered with dark forests, south of Shechem, from which Abimelech and his men gathered wood to burn that city (<a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#048">Jdg 9:48</a>). In <a href="../kjv/psa068.htm#014">Psa 68:14</a> the change from war to peace is likened to snow on the dark mountain, as some interpret the expression. Others suppose the words here mean that the bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that it seemed to be white as if covered with snow. The reference, however, of the psalm is probably to Josh. 11 and 12. The scattering of the kings and their followers is fitly likened unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on the dark Salmon. It is the modern Jebel Suleiman.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Salmone</b></a>     A promontory on the east of Crete, under which Paul sailed on his voyage to Rome (<a href="../kjv/act027.htm#007">Act 27:7</a>); the modern Cape Sidero. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Salome</b></a>     Perfect.     (1.) The wife of Zebedee and mother of James and John (<a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#056">Mat 27:56</a>), and probably the sister of Mary, the mother of our Lord (<a href="../kjv/joh019.htm#025">Joh 19:25</a>). She sought for her sons places of honour in Christ's kingdom (<a href="../kjv/mat020.htm#020">Mat 20:20</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat020.htm#021">Mat 20:21</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/mat019.htm#028">Mat 19:28</a>). She witnessed the crucifixion (<a href="../kjv/mar015.htm#040">Mar 15:40</a>), and was present with the other women at the sepulchre (<a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#056">Mat 27:56</a>). (2.) "The daughter of Herodias," not named in the New Testament. On the occasion of the birthday festival held by Herod Antipas, who had married her mother Herodias, in the fortress of Machaerus, she "came in and danced, and pleased Herod" (Mark 6:14-29). John the Baptist, at that time a prisoner in the dungeons underneath the castle, was at her request beheaded by order of Herod, and his head given to the damsel in a charger, "and the damsel gave it to her mother," whose revengeful spirit was thus gratified. "A luxurious feast of the period" (says Farrar, Life of Christ) "was not regarded as complete unless it closed with some gross pantomimic representation; and doubtless Herod had adopted the evil fashion of his day. But he had not anticipated for his guests the rare luxury of seeing a princess, his own niece, a grand-daughter of Herod the Great and of Mariamne, a descendant, therefore, of Simon the high priest and the great line of Maccabean princes, a princess who afterwards became the wife of a tetrarch [Philip, tetrarch of Trachonitis] and the mother of a king, honouring them by degrading herself into a scenic dancer."

 <p><a name="008"><b>Salt</b></a>     Used to season food (<a href="../kjv/job006.htm#006">Job 6:6</a>), and mixed with the fodder of cattle (<a href="../kjv/isa030.htm#024">Isa 30:24</a>, "clean;" in marg. of R.V. "salted"). All meat-offerings were seasoned with salt (<a href="../kjv/lev002.htm#013">Lev 2:13</a>). To eat salt with one is to partake of his hospitality, to derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was bound to look after his host's interests (<a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#014">Ezr 4:14</a>, "We have maintenance from the king's palace;" A.V. marg., "We are salted with the salt of the palace;" R.V., "We eat the salt of the palace"). A "covenant of salt" (<a href="../kjv/num018.htm#019">Num 18:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2013.htm#005">Ch2 13:5</a>) was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with salt (<a href="../kjv/eze016.htm#004">Eze 16:4</a>). Disciples are likened unto salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving uses (<a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#013">Mat 5:13</a>). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem, he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a barren soil (<a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#045">Jdg 9:45</a>). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on scientific grounds, that under the generic name of "salt," in certain passages, we are to understand petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in <a href="../kjv/gen019.htm#026">Gen 19:26</a> he would read "pillar of asphalt;" and in <a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#013">Mat 5:13</a>, instead of "salt," "petroleum," which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made. The Jebel Usdum, to the south of the Dead Sea, is a mountain of rock salt about 7 miles long and from 2 to 3 miles wide and some hundreds of feet high.
