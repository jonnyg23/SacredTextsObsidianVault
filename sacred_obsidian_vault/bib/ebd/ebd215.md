 <p><a name="000"><b>Justus</b></a>      (1.) Another name for Joseph, surnamed Barsabas. He and Matthias are mentioned only in <a href="../kjv/act001.htm#002">Act 1:2</a>. "They must have been among the earliest disciples of Jesus, and must have been faithful to the end; they must have been well known and esteemed among the brethren. What became of them afterwards, and what work they did, are entirely unknown" (Lindsay's Acts of the Apostles). (2.) A Jewish proselyte at Corinth, in whose house, next door to the synagogue, Paul held meetings and preached after he left the synagogue (<a href="../kjv/act018.htm#007">Act 18:7</a>). (3.) A Jewish Christian, called Jesus, Paul's only fellow-labourer at Rome, where he wrote his Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="../kjv/col004.htm#011">Col 4:11</a>).

 <p><a name="001"><b>Juttah</b></a>     Extended, a Levitical city in the mountains or hill-country of Judah (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#055">Jos 15:55</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos021.htm#016">Jos 21:16</a>). Its modern name is Yutta, a place about 5 1/2 miles south of Hebron. It is supposed to have been the residence of Zacharias and Elisabeth, and the birthplace of John the Baptist, and on this account is annually visited by thousands of pilgrims belonging to the Greek Church (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#039">Luk 1:39</a>). (See MARY.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Kabzeel</b></a>     Gathering of God, a city in the extreme south of Judah, near to Idumaea (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#021">Jos 15:21</a>), the birthplace of Benaiah, one of David's chief warriors (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#020">Sa2 23:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#022">Ch1 11:22</a>). It was called also Jekabzeel (<a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#025">Neh 11:25</a>), after the Captivity. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Kadesh</b></a>      (1.) Holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the "wilderness" or "desert of Zin" (<a href="../kjv/gen014.htm#007">Gen 14:7</a>; Num. 13:3-26; <a href="../kjv/num014.htm#029">Num 14:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/num020.htm#001">Num 20:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/num027.htm#014">Num 27:14</a>), on the border of Edom (<a href="../kjv/num020.htm#016">Num 20:16</a>). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth "twelve spies" to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land (<a href="../kjv/num013.htm#018">Num 13:18</a>). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. (See HORMAH; KORAH.) Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, "by way of the Red Sea" (<a href="../kjv/deu002.htm#001">Deu 2:1</a>). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.) At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, "with his rod smote the rock twice," instead of "speaking to the rock before their eyes," as the Lord had commanded him (Compare <a href="../kjv/num027.htm#014">Num 27:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu009.htm#023">Deu 9:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa106.htm#032">Psa 106:32</a>, <a href="../kjv/psa106.htm#033">Psa 106:33</a>). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land (<a href="../kjv/num020.htm#012">Num 20:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/num020.htm#024">Num 20:24</a>). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and "came unto Mount Hor" (<a href="../kjv/num020.htm#022">Num 20:22</a>). This place has been identified with  'Ain el-Kadeis , about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba. (See SPIES.) (2.) The sacred city of the Hittites, on the left bank of the Orontes, about 4 miles south of the Lake of Homs. It is identified with the great mound Tell Neby Mendeh, some 50 to 100 feet high, and 400 yards long. On the ruins of the temple of Karnak, in Egypt, has been found an inscription recording the capture of this city by Rameses II. (See PHARAOH.) Here the sculptor "has chiseled in deep work on the stone, with a bold execution of the several parts, the procession of the warriors, the battle before Kadesh, the storming of the fortress, the overthrow of the enemy, and the camp life of the Egyptians." (See HITTITES.)

 <p><a name="005"><b>Kadmonites</b></a>     Orientals, the name of a Canaanitish tribe which inhabited the north-eastern part of Palestine in the time of Abraham (<a href="../kjv/gen015.htm#019">Gen 15:19</a>). Probably they were identical with the "children of the east," who inhabited the country between Palestine and the Euphrates.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Kanah</b></a>     Reedy; brook of reeds.     (1.) A stream forming the boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh, from the Mediterranean eastward to Tappuah (<a href="../kjv/jos016.htm#008">Jos 16:8</a>). It has been identified with the sedgy streams that constitute the Wady Talaik, which enters the sea between Joppa and Caesarea. Others identify it with the river  'Aujeh . (2.) A town in the north of Asher (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#028">Jos 19:28</a>). It has been identified with  'Ain-Kana , a village on the brow of a valley some 7 miles south-east of Tyre. About a mile north of this place are many colossal ruins strewn about. And in the side of a neighbouring ravine are figures of men, women, and children cut in the face of the rock. These are supposed to be of Phoenician origin.

 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Karkor</b></a>     Foundation, a place in the open desert wastes on the east of Jordan (<a href="../kjv/jdg008.htm#010">Jdg 8:10</a>), not far beyond Succoth and Penuel, to the south. Here Gideon overtook and routed a fugitive band of Midianites under Zeba and Zalmunna, whom he took captive.
