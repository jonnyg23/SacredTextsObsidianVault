 <p><a name="000"><b>Ibzan</b></a>     Illustrious, the tenth judge of Israel (<a href="../kjv/jdg012.htm#008">Jdg 12:8</a>). He ruled seven years. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Ice</b></a>     Frequently mentioned (<a href="../kjv/job006.htm#016">Job 6:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/job038.htm#029">Job 38:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa147.htm#017">Psa 147:17</a>, etc.). (See CRYSTAL.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Ichabod</b></a>     When the tidings of the disastrous defeat of the Israelites in the battle against the Philistines near to Mizpeh were carried to Shiloh, the wife of Phinehas "was near to be delivered. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed" (<a href="../kjv/sa1004.htm#019">Sa1 4:19</a>). In her great distress she regarded not "the women that stood by her," but named the child that was born "Ichabod" i.e., no glory, saying, "The glory is departed from Israel;" and with that word on her lips she expired. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Iconium</b></a>     The capital of ancient Lycaonia. It was first visited by Paul and Barnabas from Antioch-in-Pisidia during the apostle's first missionary journey (<a href="../kjv/act013.htm#050">Act 13:50</a>, <a href="../kjv/act013.htm#051">Act 13:51</a>). Here they were persecuted by the Jews, and being driven from the city, they fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium, and encouraged the church which had been founded there (<a href="../kjv/act014.htm#021">Act 14:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/act014.htm#022">Act 14:22</a>). It was probably again visited by Paul during his third missionary journey along with Silas (<a href="../kjv/act018.htm#023">Act 18:23</a>). It is the modern Konieh, at the foot of Mount Taurus, about 120 miles inland from the Mediterranean. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Idalah</b></a>     Snares(?), a city near the west border of Zebulun (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#015">Jos 19:15</a>). It has been identified with the modern Jeida, in the valley of Kishon. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Iddo</b></a>      (1.) Timely (<a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#021">Ch1 6:21</a>). A Gershonite Levite. (2.) Lovely. The son of Zechariah (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#021">Ch1 27:21</a>), the ruler of Manasseh in David's time. (3.) Timely.

A prophet of Judah who wrote the history of Rehoboam and Abijah (<a href="../kjv/ch2012.htm#015">Ch2 12:15</a>). He has been identified with Oded (<a href="../kjv/ch2015.htm#001">Ch2 15:1</a>). (5.) Lovely. The father of Berachiah, and grandfather of the prophet Zechariah (<a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#001">Zac 1:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#007">Zac 1:7</a>). He returned from Babylon (<a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#004">Neh 12:4</a>).

"Nothing can be more instructive and significant than this multiplicity and variety of words designating the instruments and inventions of idolatry."

 <p><a name="007"><b>Idolatry</b></a>     Image-worship or divine honour paid to any created object. Paul describes the origin of idolatry in <a href="../kjv/rom001.htm#021">Rom 1:21</a> : men forsook God, and sank into ignorance and moral corruption (<a href="../kjv/rom001.htm#028">Rom 1:28</a>). The forms of idolatry are,     (1.) Fetishism, or the worship of trees, rivers, hills, stones, etc. (2.) Nature worship, the worship of the sun, moon, and stars, as the supposed powers of nature. (3.) Hero worship, the worship of deceased ancestors, or of heroes.    In Scripture, idolatry is regarded as of heathen origin, and as being imported among the Hebrews through contact with heathen nations. The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim (<a href="../kjv/gen031.htm#019">Gen 31:19</a>), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban's progenitors "on the other side of the river in old time" (<a href="../kjv/jos024.htm#002">Jos 24:2</a>). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it (<a href="../kjv/jos024.htm#014">Jos 24:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze020.htm#007">Eze 20:7</a>). Many a token of God's displeasure fell upon them because of this sin. The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years' wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies. The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction (<a href="../kjv/exo022.htm#020">Exo 22:20</a>). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment (<a href="../kjv/deu013.htm#002">Deu 13:2</a>), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned (<a href="../kjv/deu017.htm#002">Deu 17:2</a>). To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity (<a href="../kjv/deu013.htm#006">Deu 13:6</a>). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry (<a href="../kjv/exo034.htm#015">Exo 34:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo034.htm#016">Exo 34:16</a>; Deut. 7; <a href="../kjv/deu012.htm#029">Deu 12:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu020.htm#017">Deu 20:17</a>), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause (<a href="../kjv/jer002.htm#017">Jer 2:17</a>). "A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death." Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offense (<a href="../kjv/sa1015.htm#023">Sa1 15:23</a>), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the Canaanites (<a href="../kjv/exo023.htm#024">Exo 23:24</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo023.htm#032">Exo 23:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo034.htm#013">Exo 34:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu007.htm#005">Deu 7:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/deu007.htm#025">Deu 7:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu012.htm#001">Deu 12:1</a>). In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate covetousness (<a href="../kjv/mat006.htm#024">Mat 6:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk016.htm#013">Luk 16:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/col003.htm#005">Col 3:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph005.htm#005">Eph 5:5</a>).
