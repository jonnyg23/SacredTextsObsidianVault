 <p><a name="000"><b>Zebudah</b></a>     Given, the wife of Josiah and mother of Jehoiakim (<a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#036">Kg2 23:36</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Zebul</b></a>     Habitation, the governor of Shechem under Abimelech (<a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#028">Jdg 9:28</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#030">Jdg 9:30</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#036">Jdg 9:36</a>). He informed his master of the intention of the people of Shechem to transfer their allegiance to the Hivite tribe of Hamor. This led to Abimelech's destroying the city, when he put its entire population to the sword, and sowed the ruins with salt (Judg. 9:28-45). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Zebulonite</b></a>     The designation of Elon, the judge who belonged to the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="../kjv/jdg012.htm#011">Jdg 12:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg012.htm#012">Jdg 12:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Zebulun</b></a>     Dwelling, the sixth and youngest son of Jacob and Leah (<a href="../kjv/gen030.htm#020">Gen 30:20</a>). Little is known of his personal history. He had three sons (<a href="../kjv/gen046.htm#014">Gen 46:14</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Zebulun, Tribe of</b></a>     Numbered at Sinai (<a href="../kjv/num001.htm#031">Num 1:31</a>) and before entering Canaan (<a href="../kjv/num026.htm#027">Num 26:27</a>). It was one of the tribes which did not drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#030">Jdg 1:30</a>). It took little interest in public affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon (<a href="../kjv/jdg006.htm#035">Jdg 6:35</a>), and afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron (<a href="../kjv/ch1012.htm#033">Ch1 12:33</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1012.htm#040">Ch1 12:40</a>). Along with the other northern tribes, Zebulun was carried away into the land of Assyria by Tiglath-pileser (<a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</a>). In Deborah's song the words, "Out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer" (<a href="../kjv/jdg005.htm#014">Jdg 5:14</a>) has been rendered in the R.V., "They that handle the marshal's staff." This is a questionable rendering. "The word sopher ('scribe' or 'writer') defines the word shebhet ('rod' or 'pen') with which it is conjoined. The 'rod of the scribe' on the Assyrian monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the 'lawgivers.'" (Sayce).

 <p><a name="005"><b>Zebulun, Lot of</b></a>     In Galilee, to the north of Issachar and south of Asher and Naphtali (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#010">Jos 19:10</a>), and between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean. According to ancient prophecy this part of Galilee enjoyed a large share of our Lord's public ministry (<a href="../kjv/isa009.htm#001">Isa 9:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/isa009.htm#002">Isa 9:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat004.htm#012">Mat 4:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Zechariah</b></a>     Jehovah is renowned or remembered.     (1.) A prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the twelve minor prophets. Like Ezekiel, he was of priestly extraction. He describes himself (<a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#001">Zac 1:1</a>) as "the son of Berechiah." In <a href="../kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1</a> and <a href="../kjv/ezr006.htm#014">Ezr 6:14</a> he is called "the son of Iddo," who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (520 B.C.), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary with Haggai (<a href="../kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1</a>). His book consists of two distinct parts, <a href="../kjv/hag001.htm#001">Hag 1:1</a> to 8, inclusive, and 9 to the end. It begins with a preface (<a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#001">Zac 1:1</a>), which recalls the nation's past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (Zech. 1:7 - 6:8), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the crowning of Joshua (<a href="../kjv/zac006.htm#009">Zac 6:9</a>), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's Christ. <a href="../kjv/zac007.htm#001">Zac 7:1</a> and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing. The second part of the book (Zech. 9 - 14) bears no date. It is probable that a considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of two burdens. The first burden (Zech. 9 - 11) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the Advent. The second burden (Zech. 12 - 14) points out the glories that await Israel in "the latter day", the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom. (2.) The son or grandson of Jehoiada, the high priest in the times of Ahaziah and Joash. After the death of Jehoiada he boldly condemned both the king and the people for their rebellion against God (<a href="../kjv/ch2024.htm#020">Ch2 24:20</a>), which so stirred up their resentment against him that at the king's commandment they stoned him with stones, and he died "in the court of the house of the Lord" (<a href="../kjv/ch2024.htm#021">Ch2 24:21</a>). Christ alludes to this deed of murder in <a href="../kjv/mat023.htm#035">Mat 23:35</a>, <a href="../kjv/luk011.htm#051">Luk 11:51</a>. (See ZACHARIAS [2].) (3.) A prophet, who had "understanding in the seeing of God," in the time of Uzziah, who was much indebted to him for his wise counsel (<a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#005">Ch2 26:5</a>). Besides these, there is a large number of persons mentioned in Scripture bearing this name of whom nothing is known. (4.) One of the chiefs of the tribe of Reuben (<a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#007">Ch1 5:7</a>). (5.) One of the porters of the tabernacle (<a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#021">Ch1 9:21</a>). (6.) <a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#037">Ch1 9:37</a>. (7.) A Levite who assisted at the bringing up of the ark from the house of Obededom (<a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#020">Ch1 15:20</a>). (8.) A Kohathite Levite (<a href="../kjv/ch1024.htm#025">Ch1 24:25</a>). (9.) A Merarite Levite (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#021">Ch1 27:21</a>). (10.) The father of Iddo (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#021">Ch1 27:21</a>). (11.) One who assisted in teaching the law to the people in the time of Jehoshaphat (<a href="../kjv/ch2017.htm#007">Ch2 17:7</a>). (12.) A Levite of the sons of Asaph (<a href="../kjv/ch2020.htm#014">Ch2 20:14</a>). (13.) One of Jehoshaphat's sons (<a href="../kjv/ch2021.htm#002">Ch2 21:2</a>). (14.) The father of Abijah, who was the mother of Hezekiah (<a href="../kjv/ch2029.htm#001">Ch2 29:1</a>). (15.) One of the sons of Asaph (<a href="../kjv/ch2029.htm#013">Ch2 29:13</a>). (16.) One of the "rulers of the house of God" (<a href="../kjv/ch2035.htm#008">Ch2 35:8</a>). (17.) A chief of the people in the time of Ezra, who consulted him about the return from captivity (<a href="../kjv/ezr008.htm#016">Ezr 8:16</a>); probably the same as mentioned in <a href="../kjv/neh008.htm#004">Neh 8:4</a>, (18.) <a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#012">Neh 11:12</a>. (19.) <a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#016">Neh 12:16</a>. (20.) <a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#035">Neh 12:35</a>, <a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#041">Neh 12:41</a>. (21.) <a href="../kjv/isa008.htm#002">Isa 8:2</a>.

 <p><a name="007"><b>Zedad</b></a>     Side; sloping place, a town in the north of Palestine, near Hamath (<a href="../kjv/num034.htm#008">Num 34:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze047.htm#015">Eze 47:15</a>). It has been identified with the ruins of Sudud, between Emesa (Hums) and Baalbec, but that is uncertain. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Zedekiah</b></a>     Righteousness of Jehovah.     (1.) The last king of Judah. He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz (<a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#031">Kg2 23:31</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#017">Kg2 24:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#018">Kg2 24:18</a>). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet "he did evil in the sight of the Lord" (<a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#019">Kg2 24:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#020">Kg2 24:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer052.htm#002">Jer 52:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer052.htm#003">Jer 52:3</a>). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, "with all his host" (<a href="../kjv/kg2025.htm#001">Kg2 25:1</a>), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, "every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs" (<a href="../kjv/kg2025.htm#003">Kg2 25:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/lam004.htm#004">Lam 4:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/lam004.htm#005">Lam 4:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/lam004.htm#010">Lam 4:10</a>). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (588 B.C.) to Babylon (<a href="../kjv/kg2025.htm#001">Kg2 25:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2036.htm#012">Ch2 36:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer032.htm#004">Jer 32:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer032.htm#005">Jer 32:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer034.htm#002">Jer 34:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer034.htm#003">Jer 34:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer039.htm#001">Jer 39:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer052.htm#004">Jer 52:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze012.htm#012">Eze 12:12</a>), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death. After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandman were permitted to remain in the land (<a href="../kjv/jer052.htm#016">Jer 52:16</a>). Gedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled over Judah (<a href="../kjv/kg2025.htm#022">Kg2 25:22</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2025.htm#024">Kg2 25:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer040.htm#002">Jer 40:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer040.htm#005">Jer 40:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer040.htm#006">Jer 40:6</a>). (2.) The son of Chenaanah, a false prophet in the days of Ahab (<a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#011">Kg1 22:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#024">Kg1 22:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2018.htm#010">Ch2 18:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch2018.htm#023">Ch2 18:23</a>). (3.) The son of Hananiah, a prince of Judah in the days of Jehoiakim (<a href="../kjv/jer036.htm#012">Jer 36:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Zeeb</b></a>     The wolf, one of the two leaders of the great Midianite host which invaded Israel and was utterly routed by Gideon. The division of that host, which attempted to escape across the Jordan, under Oreb and Zeeb, was overtaken by the Ephraimites, who, in a great battle, completely vanquished them, their leaders being taken and slain (<a href="../kjv/jdg007.htm#025">Jdg 7:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa083.htm#011">Psa 83:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa010.htm#026">Isa 10:26</a>).
