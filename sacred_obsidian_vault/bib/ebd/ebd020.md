 <p><a name="000"><b>Ambush</b></a>     Joshua at the capture of Ai lay in ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he gained an easy victory (Josh. 8:4-26). Shechem was taken in this manner (Judg. 9:30-45. Compare <a href="../kjv/jer051.htm#012">Jer 51:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Amen</b></a>     This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful (<a href="../kjv/rev003.htm#014">Rev 3:14</a>). In <a href="../kjv/isa065.htm#016">Isa 65:16</a>, the Authorized Version has "the God of truth," which in Hebrew is "the God of Amen." It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated "verily." Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel, it is repeated, "Verily, verily." It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="../kjv/rev003.htm#014">Rev 3:14</a>). It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers (<a href="../kjv/psa041.htm#013">Psa 41:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa072.htm#019">Psa 72:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa089.htm#052">Psa 89:52</a>), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfillment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an oath (<a href="../kjv/num005.htm#022">Num 5:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu027.htm#015">Deu 27:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh005.htm#013">Neh 5:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh008.htm#006">Neh 8:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1016.htm#036">Ch1 16:36</a>). In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say "Amen" at the close of the prayer (<a href="../kjv/co1014.htm#016">Co1 14:16</a>). The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure (<a href="../kjv/co2001.htm#020">Co2 1:20</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Amethyst</b></a>     One of the precious stones in the breastplate of the high priest (<a href="../kjv/exo028.htm#019">Exo 28:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo039.htm#012">Exo 39:12</a>), and in the foundation of the New Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#020">Rev 21:20</a>). The ancients thought that this stone had the power of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore or touched it, and hence its Greek name formed from a, " privative ," and  methuo , "to get drunk." Its Jewish name,  ahlamah' , was derived by the rabbins from the Hebrew word  halam , "to dream," from its supposed power of causing the wearer to dream. It is a pale-blue crystallized quartz, varying to a dark purple blue. It is found in Persia and India, also in different parts of Europe.
