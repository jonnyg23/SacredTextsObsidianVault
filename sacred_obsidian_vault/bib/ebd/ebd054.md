 <p><a name="004"><b>Bethabara</b></a>     House of the ford, a place on the east bank of the Jordan, where John was baptizing (<a href="../kjv/joh001.htm#028">Joh 1:28</a>). It may be identical with Bethbarah, the ancient ford of Jordan of which the men of Ephraim took possession (<a href="../kjv/jdg007.htm#024">Jdg 7:24</a>). The Revised Version reads "Bethany beyond Jordan." It was the great ford, and still bears the name of "the ford," Makhadhet  'Abarah , "the ford of crossing over," about 25 miles from Nazareth. (See BETH-BARAH.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Beth-anath</b></a>     House of response, one of the fenced cities of Naphtali (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#038">Jos 19:38</a>). It is perhaps identical with the modern village  'Ainata , 6 miles west of Kedesh.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Beth-anoth</b></a>     House of answers, a city in the mountainous district of Judah (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#059">Jos 15:59</a>). It has been identified with the modern  Beit-'Anun , about 3 miles northeast of Hebron. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Bethany</b></a>     House of dates.     (1.) The Revised Version in <a href="../kjv/joh001.htm#028">Joh 1:28</a> has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan. (2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (<a href="../kjv/mar011.htm#001">Mar 11:1</a>), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord (<a href="../kjv/mat021.htm#017">Mat 21:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat026.htm#006">Mat 26:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar011.htm#011">Mar 11:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/mar011.htm#012">Mar 11:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar014.htm#003">Mar 14:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk024.htm#050">Luk 24:50</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh011.htm#001">Joh 11:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh012.htm#001">Joh 12:1</a>). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., "place of Lazarus," or simply Lazariyeh. Seen from a distance, the village has been described as "remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace." Now a mean village, containing about twenty families.

 <p><a name="008"><b>Beth-arabah</b></a>     House of the desert, one of the six cities of Judah, situated in the sunk valley of the Jordan and Dead Sea (<a href="../kjv/jos018.htm#022">Jos 18:22</a>). In <a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#061">Jos 15:61</a> it is said to have been "in the wilderness." It was afterwards included in the towns of Benjamin. It is called Arabah (<a href="../kjv/jos018.htm#018">Jos 18:18</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Beth-aram</b></a>     House of the height; i.e., "mountain-house", one of the towns of Gad, 3 miles east of Jordan, opposite Jericho (<a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#027">Jos 13:27</a>). Probably the same as Beth-haran in <a href="../kjv/num032.htm#036">Num 32:36</a>. It was called by king Herod, Julias, or Livias, after Livia, the wife of Augustus. It is now called Beit-haran.
