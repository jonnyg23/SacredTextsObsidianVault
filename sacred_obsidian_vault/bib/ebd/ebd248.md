 <p><a name="000"><b>Memucan</b></a>     Dignified, one of the royal counsellors at the court of Ahasuerus, by whose suggestion Vashti was divorced (<a href="../kjv/est001.htm#014">Est 1:14</a>, <a href="../kjv/est001.htm#016">Est 1:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/est001.htm#021">Est 1:21</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Menahem</b></a>     Comforting, the son of Gadi, and successor of Shallum, king of Israel, whom he slew. After a reign of about ten years (771-760 B.C.) he died, leaving the throne to his son Pekahiah. His reign was one of cruelty and oppression (<a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#014">Kg2 15:14</a>). During his reign, Pul (q.v.), king of Assyria, came with a powerful force against Israel, but was induced to retire by a gift from Menahem of 1,000 talents of silver.

 <p><a name="002"><b>Mene</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/dan005.htm#025">Dan 5:25</a>, <a href="../kjv/dan005.htm#026">Dan 5:26</a>), numbered, one of the words of the mysterious inscription written "upon the plaster of the wall" in Belshazzar's palace at Babylon. The writing was explained by Daniel. (See BELSHAZZAR.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Meni</b></a>     <a href="../kjv/isa065.htm#011">Isa 65:11</a>, marg. (A.V., "that number;" R.V., "destiny"), probably an idol which the captive Israelites worshipped after the example of the Babylonians. It may have been a symbol of destiny. LXX., tuche. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Meonenim</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#037">Jdg 9:37</a>; A.V., "the plain of Meonenim;" R.V., "the oak of Meonenim") means properly "soothsayers" or "sorcerers," "wizards" (<a href="../kjv/deu018.htm#010">Deu 18:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/deu018.htm#014">Deu 18:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2021.htm#006">Kg2 21:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/mic005.htm#012">Mic 5:12</a>). This may be the oak at Shechem under which Abram pitched his tent (see SHECHEM), the "enchanter's oak," so called, perhaps, from Jacob's hiding the "strange gods" under it (<a href="../kjv/gen035.htm#004">Gen 35:4</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Mephaath</b></a>     Splendour, a Levitical city (<a href="../kjv/jos021.htm#037">Jos 21:37</a>) of the tribe of Reuben (<a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#018">Jos 13:18</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Mephibosheth</b></a>     Exterminator of shame; i.e., of idols.     (1.) The name of Saul's son by the concubine Rizpah (q.v.), the daughter of Aiah. He and his brother Armoni were with five others "hanged on a hill before the Lord" by the Gibeonites, and their bodies exposed in the sun for five months (<a href="../kjv/sa2021.htm#008">Sa2 21:8</a>). (2.) The son of Jonathan, and grandson of Saul (<a href="../kjv/sa2004.htm#004">Sa2 4:4</a>). He was but five years old when his father and grandfather fell on Mount Gilboa. The child's nurse hearing of this calamity, fled with him from Gibeah, the royal residence, and stumbling in her haste, the child was thrown to the ground and maimed in both his feet, and ever after was unable to walk (<a href="../kjv/sa2019.htm#026">Sa2 19:26</a>). He was carried to the land of Gilead, where he found a refuge in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar, by whom he was brought up.    Some years after this, when David had subdued all the adversaries of Israel, he began to think of the family of Jonathan, and discovered that Mephibosheth was residing in the house of Machir. Thither he sent royal messengers, and brought him and his infant son to Jerusalem, where he ever afterwards resided (<a href="../kjv/sa2009.htm#001">Sa2 9:1</a>). When David was a fugitive, according to the story of Ziba (<a href="../kjv/sa2016.htm#001">Sa2 16:1</a>) Mephibosheth proved unfaithful to him, and was consequently deprived of half of his estates; but according to his own story, however (<a href="../kjv/sa2019.htm#024">Sa2 19:24</a>), he had remained loyal to his friend. After this incident he is only mentioned as having been protected by David against the vengeance the Gibeonites were permitted to execute on the house of Saul (<a href="../kjv/sa2021.htm#007">Sa2 21:7</a>). He is also called Merib-baal (<a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#034">Ch1 8:34</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#040">Ch1 9:40</a>). (See ZIBA.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Merab</b></a>     Increase, the eldest of Saul's two daughters (<a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#049">Sa1 14:49</a>). She was betrothed to David after his victory over Goliath, but does not seem to have entered heartily into this arrangement (<a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#002">Sa1 18:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#017">Sa1 18:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#019">Sa1 18:19</a>). She was at length, however, married to Adriel of Abel-Meholah, a town in the Jordan valley, about 10 miles south of Bethshean, with whom the house of Saul maintained alliance. She had five sons, who were all put to death by the Gibeonites on the hill of Gibeah (<a href="../kjv/sa2021.htm#008">Sa2 21:8</a>).

 <p><a name="008"><b>Meraiah</b></a>     Resistance, a chief priest, a contemporary of the high priest Joiakim (<a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#012">Neh 12:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Meraioth</b></a>     Rebellions.     (1.) Father of Amariah, a high priest of the line of Eleazar (<a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#006">Ch1 6:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#007">Ch1 6:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#052">Ch1 6:52</a>). (2.) <a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#015">Neh 12:15</a>, a priest who went to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel. He is called Meremoth in <a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#003">Neh 12:3</a>.
