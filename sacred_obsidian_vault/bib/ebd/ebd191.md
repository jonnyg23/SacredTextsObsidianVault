 <p><a name="000"><b>Israel</b></a>     The name conferred on Jacob after the great prayer-struggle at Peniel (<a href="../kjv/gen032.htm#028">Gen 32:28</a>), because "as a prince he had power with God and prevailed." (See JACOB.) This is the common name given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people of the twelve tribes are called "Israelites," the "children of Israel" (<a href="../kjv/jos003.htm#017">Jos 3:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos007.htm#025">Jos 7:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg008.htm#027">Jdg 8:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer003.htm#021">Jer 3:21</a>), and the "house of Israel" (<a href="../kjv/exo016.htm#031">Exo 16:31</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo040.htm#038">Exo 40:38</a>). This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true Israel (<a href="../kjv/psa073.htm#001">Psa 73:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa045.htm#017">Isa 45:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh001.htm#047">Joh 1:47</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom009.htm#006">Rom 9:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom011.htm#026">Rom 11:26</a>). After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to themselves this name, as if they were the whole nation (<a href="../kjv/sa2002.htm#009">Sa2 2:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2002.htm#010">Sa2 2:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2002.htm#017">Sa2 2:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2002.htm#028">Sa2 2:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#010">Sa2 3:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#017">Sa2 3:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2019.htm#040">Sa2 19:40</a>), and the kings of the ten tribes were called "kings of Israel," while the kings of the two tribes were called "kings of Judah." After the Exile the name Israel was assumed as designating the entire nation.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Israel, Kingdom of</b></a>     (975-722 B.C.). Soon after the death of Solomon, Ahijah's prophecy (<a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#031">Kg1 11:31</a>) was fulfilled, and the kingdom was rent in twain.       See map, Kingdoms of Israel and Judah     Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents (<a href="../kjv/kg1012.htm#002">Kg1 12:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1012.htm#003">Kg1 12:3</a>). Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his father had imposed on his subjects (<a href="../kjv/kg1012.htm#004">Kg1 12:4</a>), and the rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, "Every man to his tents, O Israel" (<a href="../kjv/sa2020.htm#001">Sa2 20:1</a>). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:1-18; 2 Chr. 10), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon's son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of Ahab.

In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean did not much exceed 13000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about 9375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this kingdom (<a href="../kjv/kg1012.htm#025">Kg1 12:25</a>) afterwards Tirza (<a href="../kjv/kg1014.htm#017">Kg1 14:17</a>). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the capital (<a href="../kjv/kg1016.htm#024">Kg1 16:24</a>) and continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians (<a href="../kjv/kg2017.htm#005">Kg2 17:5</a>). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon who himself thus records the capture of that city: "Samaria I looked at I captured; 27280 men who dwelt in it I carried away" (<a href="../kjv/kg2017.htm#006">Kg2 17:6</a>) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered throughout the East. (See CAPTIVITY.) "Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three years and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe and eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria and swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine." After the deportation of the ten tribes the deserted land was colonized by various eastern tribes whom the king of Assyria sent thither (<a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#002">Ezr 4:2</a> <a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#010">Ezr 4:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2017.htm#024">Kg2 17:24</a>). (See KINGS.) In contrast with the kingdom of Judah is that of Israel.     (1.) "There was no fixed capital and no religious centre. (2.) The army was often insubordinate. (3.) The succession was constantly interrupted so that out of nineteen kings there were no less than nine dynasties each ushered in by a revolution. (4.) The authorized priests left the kingdom in a body and the priesthood established by Jeroboam had no divine sanction and no promise; it was corrupt at its very source." (Maclean's O. T. Hist.)

He was Jacob's ninth son, and was born in Padan-aram (compare <a href="../kjv/gen028.htm#002">Gen 28:2</a>).

This tribe contained 54,400 fighting men when the census was taken at Sinai. After the entrance into the Promised Land, this tribe was one of the six which stood on Gerizim during the ceremony of the blessing and cursing (<a href="../kjv/deu027.htm#012">Deu 27:12</a>).
