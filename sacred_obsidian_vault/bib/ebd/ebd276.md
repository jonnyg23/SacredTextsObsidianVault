 <p><a name="000"><b>Oath</b></a>     A solemn appeal to God, permitted on fitting occasions (<a href="../kjv/deu006.htm#013">Deu 6:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer004.htm#002">Jer 4:2</a>), in various forms (<a href="../kjv/gen016.htm#005">Gen 16:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2012.htm#005">Sa2 12:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/rut001.htm#017">Rut 1:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/hos004.htm#015">Hos 4:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom001.htm#009">Rom 1:9</a>), and taken in different ways (<a href="../kjv/gen014.htm#022">Gen 14:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen024.htm#002">Gen 24:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2006.htm#022">Ch2 6:22</a>). God is represented as taking an oath (<a href="../kjv/heb006.htm#016">Heb 6:16</a>), so also Christ (<a href="../kjv/mat026.htm#064">Mat 26:64</a>), and Paul (<a href="../kjv/rom009.htm#001">Rom 9:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/gal001.htm#020">Gal 1:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/phi001.htm#008">Phi 1:8</a>). The precept, "Swear not at all," refers probably to ordinary conversation between man and man (<a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#034">Mat 5:34</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#037">Mat 5:37</a>). But if the words are taken as referring to oaths, then their intention may have been to show "that the proper state of Christians is to require no oaths; that when evil is expelled from among them every yea and nay will be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow."

 <p><a name="001"><b>Obadiah</b></a>     Servant of the Lord.     (1.) An Israelite who was chief in the household of King Ahab (<a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#003">Kg1 18:3</a>). Amid great spiritual degeneracy he maintained his fidelity to God, and interposed to protect The Lord's prophets, an hundred of whom he hid at great personal risk in a cave (<a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#004">Kg1 18:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#013">Kg1 18:13</a>). Ahab seems to have held Obadiah in great honour, although he had no sympathy with his piety (<a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#005">Kg1 18:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#006">Kg1 18:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#007">Kg1 18:7</a>). The last notice of him is his bringing back tidings to Ahab that Elijah, whom he had so long sought for, was at hand (<a href="../kjv/kg1018.htm#009">Kg1 18:9</a>). "Go," said Elijah to him, when he met him in the way, "go tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here." (2.) A chief of the tribe of Issachar (<a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#003">Ch1 7:3</a>). (3.) A descendant of Saul (<a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#038">Ch1 8:38</a>). (4.) A Levite, after the Captivity (<a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#016">Ch1 9:16</a>). (5.) A Gadite who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="../kjv/ch1012.htm#009">Ch1 12:9</a>). (6.) A prince of Zebulun in the time of David (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#019">Ch1 27:19</a>). (7.) One of the princes sent by Jehoshaphat to instruct the people in the law (<a href="../kjv/ch2017.htm#007">Ch2 17:7</a>). (8.) A Levite who superintended the repairs of the temple under Josiah (<a href="../kjv/ch2034.htm#012">Ch2 34:12</a>). (9.) One who accompanied Ezra on the return from Babylon (<a href="../kjv/ezr008.htm#009">Ezr 8:9</a>). (10.) A prophet, fourth of the minor prophets in the Hebrew canon, and fifth in the LXX. He was probably contemporary with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Of his personal history nothing is known.

 <p><a name="002"><b>Obadiah, Book of</b></a>     Consists of one chapter, "concerning Edom," its impending doom (Obad. 1-16), and the restoration of Israel (<a href="../kjv/oba001.htm#017">Oba 1:17</a>). This is the shortest book of the Old Testament. There are on record the account of four captures of Jerusalem,     (1.) by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="../kjv/kg1014.htm#025">Kg1 14:25</a>); (2.) by the Philistines and Arabians in the reign of Jehoram (<a href="../kjv/ch2021.htm#016">Ch2 21:16</a>); (3.) by Joash, the king of Israel, in the reign of Amaziah (<a href="../kjv/kg2014.htm#013">Kg2 14:13</a>); and (4.) by the Babylonians, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (586 B.C.). Obadiah (<a href="../kjv/oba001.htm#011">Oba 1:11</a>) speaks of this capture as a thing past. He sees the calamity as having already come on Jerusalem, and the Edomites as joining their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing about the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read that the Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans, but the probabilities are that they did so, and this explains the words of Obadiah in denouncing against Edom the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies was thus in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem.    Edom is the type of Israel's and of God's last foe (<a href="../kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1</a>). These will finally all be vanquished, and the kingdom will be the Lord's (Compare <a href="../kjv/psa022.htm#028">Psa 22:28</a>).

 <p><a name="003"><b>Obal</b></a>     Stripped, the eight son of Joktan (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#028">Gen 10:28</a>); called also Ebal (<a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#022">Ch1 1:22</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Obed</b></a>     Serving; worshipping.     (1.) A son of Boaz and Ruth (<a href="../kjv/rut004.htm#021">Rut 4:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/rut004.htm#022">Rut 4:22</a>), and the grandfather of David (<a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</a>). (2.) <a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#034">Ch1 2:34</a>. (3.) <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#007">Ch1 26:7</a>. (4.) <a href="../kjv/ch2023.htm#001">Ch2 23:1</a>.           
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Obed-Edom</b></a>     Servant of Edom.     (1.) "The Gittite" (probably so called because he was a native of Gath-rimmon), a Levite of the family of the Korhites (<a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#001">Ch1 26:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#004">Ch1 26:4</a>), to whom was specially entrusted the custody of the ark (<a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#018">Ch1 15:18</a>). When David was bringing up the ark "from the house of Abinadab, that was in Gibeah" (probably some hill or eminence near Kirjath-jearim), and had reached Nachon's threshing-floor, he became afraid because of the "breach upon Uzzah," and carried it aside into the house of Obededom (<a href="../kjv/sa2006.htm#001">Sa2 6:1</a>). There it remained for six months, and was to him and his house the occasion of great blessing. David then removed it with great rejoicing to Jerusalem, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle he had pitched for it. (2.) A Merarite Levite, a temple porter, who with his eight sons guarded the southern gate (<a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#018">Ch1 15:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#021">Ch1 15:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#004">Ch1 26:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#008">Ch1 26:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#015">Ch1 26:15</a>). (3.) One who had charge of the temple treasures (<a href="../kjv/ch2025.htm#024">Ch2 25:24</a>).

 <p><a name="007"><b>Obil</b></a>     A keeper of camels, an Ishmaelite who was "over the camels" in the time of David (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#030">Ch1 27:30</a>).
