 <p><a name="000"><b>Parchment</b></a>     A skin prepared for writing on; so called from Pergamos (q.v.), where this was first done (<a href="../kjv/ti2004.htm#013">Ti2 4:13</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Pardon</b></a>     The forgiveness of sins granted freely (<a href="../kjv/isa043.htm#025">Isa 43:25</a>), readily (<a href="../kjv/neh009.htm#017">Neh 9:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa086.htm#005">Psa 86:5</a>), abundantly (<a href="../kjv/isa055.htm#007">Isa 55:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom005.htm#020">Rom 5:20</a>). Pardon is an act of a sovereign, in pure sovereignty, granting simply a remission of the penalty due to sin, but securing neither honour nor reward to the pardoned. Justification (q.v.), on the other hand, is the act of a judge, and not of a sovereign, and includes pardon and, at the same time, a title to all the rewards and blessings promised in the covenant of life.

 <p><a name="002"><b>Parlour</b></a>     (from the Fr. parler, "to speak") denotes an "audience chamber," but that is not the import of the Hebrew word so rendered. It corresponds to what the Turks call a kiosk, as in <a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#020">Jdg 3:20</a> (the "summer parlour"), or as in the margin of the Revised Version ("the upper chamber of cooling"), a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and having a door communicating with the outside by which persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretense of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (<a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#021">Jdg 3:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#022">Jdg 3:22</a>). The "inner parlours" in <a href="../kjv/ch1028.htm#011">Ch1 28:11</a> were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the temple (<a href="../kjv/kg1006.htm#005">Kg1 6:5</a>), "side chambers;" or they may have been, as some think, the porch and the holy place. In <a href="../kjv/sa1009.htm#022">Sa1 9:22</a> the Revised Version reads "guest chamber," a chamber at the high place specially used for sacrificial feasts.

 <p><a name="003"><b>Parmashta</b></a>     Strong-fisted, a son of Haman, slain in Shushan (<a href="../kjv/est009.htm#009">Est 9:9</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Parmenas</b></a>     Constant, one of the seven "deacons" (<a href="../kjv/act006.htm#005">Act 6:5</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Parshandatha</b></a>     An interpreter of the law, the eldest of Haman's sons, slain in Shushan (<a href="../kjv/est009.htm#007">Est 9:7</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Parthians</b></a>     Were present in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<a href="../kjv/act002.htm#009">Act 2:9</a>). Parthia lay on the east of Media and south of Hyrcania, which separated it from the Caspian Sea. It corresponded with the western half of the modern Khorasan, and now forms a part of Persia.

 <p><a name="007"><b>Partridge</b></a>     (Heb.  kore , i.e., "caller"). This bird, unlike our own partridge, is distinguished by "its ringing call-note, which in early morning echoes from cliff to cliff amidst the barrenness of the wilderness of Judea and the glens of the forest of Carmel" hence its Hebrew name. This name occurs only twice in Scripture. In <a href="../kjv/sa1026.htm#020">Sa1 26:20</a> "David alludes to the mode of chase practiced now, as of old, when the partridge, continuously chased, was at length, when fatigued, knocked down by sticks thrown along the ground." It endeavours to save itself "by running, in preference to flight, unless when suddenly started. It is not an inhabitant of the plain or the corn-field, but of rocky hill-sides" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.). In <a href="../kjv/jer017.htm#011">Jer 17:11</a> the prophet is illustrating the fact that riches unlawfully acquired are precarious and short-lived. The exact nature of the illustration cannot be precisely determined. Some interpret the words as meaning that the covetous man will be as surely disappointed as the partridge which gathers in eggs, not of her own laying, and is unable to hatch them; others (Tristram), with more probability, as denoting that the man who enriches himself by unjust means "will as surely be disappointed as the partridge which commences to sit, but is speedily robbed of her hopes of a brood" by her eggs being stolen away from her. The commonest partridge in Palestine is the Caccabis saxatilis, the Greek partridge. The partridge of the wilderness ( Ammo-perdix heyi ) is a smaller species. Both are essentially mountain and rock birds, thus differing from the English partridge, which loves cultivated fields.

 <p><a name="008"><b>Paruah</b></a>     Flourishing, the father of Jehoshaphat, appointed to provide monthly supplies for Solomon from the tribe of Issachar (<a href="../kjv/kg1004.htm#017">Kg1 4:17</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Parvaim</b></a>     The name of a country from which Solomon obtained gold for the temple (<a href="../kjv/ch2003.htm#006">Ch2 3:6</a>). Some have identified it with Ophir, but it is uncertain whether it is even the name of a place. It may simply, as some think, denote "Oriental regions."
