 <p><a name="000"><b>Pallu</b></a>     Separated, the second son of Reuben (<a href="../kjv/ch1005.htm#003">Ch1 5:3</a>); called Phallu, <a href="../kjv/gen046.htm#009">Gen 46:9</a>. He was the father of the Phalluites (<a href="../kjv/exo006.htm#014">Exo 6:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/num026.htm#005">Num 26:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/num026.htm#008">Num 26:8</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Palm Tree</b></a>     (Heb.  tamar ), the date-palm characteristic of Palestine. It is described as "flourishing" (<a href="../kjv/psa092.htm#012">Psa 92:12</a>), tall (<a href="../kjv/sol007.htm#007">Sol 7:7</a>), "upright" (<a href="../kjv/jer010.htm#005">Jer 10:5</a>). Its branches are a symbol of victory (<a href="../kjv/rev007.htm#009">Rev 7:9</a>). "Rising with slender stem 40 or 50, at times even 80, feet aloft, its only branches, the feathery, snow-like, pale-green fronds from 6 to 12 feet long, bending from its top, the palm attracts the eye wherever it is seen." The whole land of Palestine was called by the Greeks and Romans Phoenicia, i.e., "the land of palms." Tadmor in the desert was called by the Greeks and Romans Palmyra, i.e., "the city of palms." The finest specimens of this tree grew at Jericho (<a href="../kjv/deu034.htm#003">Deu 34:3</a>) and Engedi and along the banks of the Jordan. Branches of the palm tree were carried at the feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../kjv/lev023.htm#040">Lev 23:40</a>). At our Lord's triumphal entrance into Jerusalem the crowds took palm branches, and went forth to meet him, crying, "Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord" (<a href="../kjv/mat021.htm#008">Mat 21:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh012.htm#013">Joh 12:13</a>). (See DATE.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Palm Trees, The City of</b></a>     The name given to Jericho (q.v.), <a href="../kjv/deu034.htm#003">Deu 34:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#016">Jdg 1:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#013">Jdg 3:13</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Palmer-worm</b></a>     (Heb.  gazam ). The English word may denote either a caterpillar (as rendered by the LXX.), which wanders like a palmer or pilgrim, or which travels like pilgrims in bands (<a href="../kjv/joe001.htm#004">Joe 1:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/joe002.htm#025">Joe 2:25</a>), the wingless locusts, or the migratory locust in its larva state. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Palsy</b></a>     A shorter form of "paralysis." Many persons thus afflicted were cured by our Lord (<a href="../kjv/mat004.htm#024">Mat 4:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat008.htm#005">Mat 8:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat009.htm#002">Mat 9:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar002.htm#003">Mar 2:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk007.htm#002">Luk 7:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh005.htm#005">Joh 5:5</a>) and the apostles (<a href="../kjv/act008.htm#007">Act 8:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/act009.htm#033">Act 9:33</a>, <a href="../kjv/act009.htm#034">Act 9:34</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Palti</b></a>     Deliverance from the Lord, one of the spies representing the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/num013.htm#009">Num 13:9</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Paltiel</b></a>     Deliverance of God, the prince of Issachar who assisted "to divide the land by inheritance" (<a href="../kjv/num034.htm#026">Num 34:26</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Paltite</b></a>     The designation of one of David's heroes (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#026">Sa2 23:26</a>); called also the Pelonite (<a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#027">Ch1 11:27</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Pamphylia</b></a>     Paul and his company, loosing from Paphos, sailed north-west and came to Perga, the capital of Pamphylia (<a href="../kjv/act013.htm#013">Act 13:13</a>, <a href="../kjv/act013.htm#014">Act 13:14</a>), a province about the middle of the southern sea-board of Asia Minor. It lay between Lycia on the west and Cilicia on the east. There were strangers from Pamphylia at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<a href="../kjv/act002.htm#010">Act 2:10</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Pan</b></a>     A vessel of metal or earthenware used in culinary operations; a cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old Testament (<a href="../kjv/lev002.htm#005">Lev 2:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev006.htm#021">Lev 6:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/num011.htm#008">Num 11:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#014">Sa1 2:14</a>, etc.). The "ash-pans" mentioned in <a href="../kjv/exo027.htm#003">Exo 27:3</a> were made of copper, and were used in connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The "iron pan" mentioned in <a href="../kjv/eze004.htm#003">Eze 4:3</a> (marg., "flat plate " or "slice") was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The "fire-pans" of <a href="../kjv/exo027.htm#003">Exo 27:3</a> were fire-shovels used for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered "snuff-dishes" (<a href="../kjv/exo025.htm#038">Exo 25:38</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo037.htm#023">Exo 37:23</a>) and "censers" (<a href="../kjv/lev010.htm#001">Lev 10:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev016.htm#012">Lev 16:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/num004.htm#014">Num 4:14</a>, etc.). These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense. The "frying-pan" mentioned in <a href="../kjv/lev002.htm#007">Lev 2:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev007.htm#009">Lev 7:9</a> was a pot for boiling.
