 <p><a name="000"><b>Nehushta</b></a>     Copper, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem, and the wife of Jehoiakin (<a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#008">Kg2 24:8</a>), king of Judah. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Nehushtan</b></a>     Of copper; a brazen thing a name of contempt given to the serpent Moses had made in the wilderness (<a href="../kjv/num021.htm#008">Num 21:8</a>), and which Hezekiah destroyed because the children of Israel began to regard it as an idol and "burn incense to it." The lapse of nearly one thousand years had invested the "brazen serpent" with a mysterious sanctity; and in order to deliver the people from their infatuation, and impress them with the idea of its worthlessness, Hezekiah called it, in contempt, "Nehushtan," a brazen thing, a mere piece of brass (<a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#004">Kg2 18:4</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Neiel</b></a>     Dwelling-place of God, a town in the territory of Asher, near its southern border (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#027">Jos 19:27</a>). It has been identified with the ruin  Y'anin , near the outlet of the Wady esh Sha-ghur, less than 2 miles north of Kabul, and 16 miles east of Caesarea. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Nekeb</b></a>     Cavern, a town on the boundary of Naphtali (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#033">Jos 19:33</a>). It has with probability, been identified with Seiyadeh, nearly 2 miles east of Bessum, a ruin half way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Nemuel</b></a>     Day of God.     (1.) One of Simeon's five sons (<a href="../kjv/ch1004.htm#024">Ch1 4:24</a>), called also Jemuel (<a href="../kjv/gen046.htm#010">Gen 46:10</a>). (2.) A Reubenite, a son of Eliab, and brother of Dathan and Abiram (<a href="../kjv/num026.htm#009">Num 26:9</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Nephilim</b></a>     <a href="../kjv/gen006.htm#004">Gen 6:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/num013.htm#033">Num 13:33</a>, R.V.), giants, the Hebrew word left untranslated by the Revisers, the name of one of the Canaanitish tribes. The Revisers have, however, translated the Hebrew gibborim, in <a href="../kjv/gen006.htm#004">Gen 6:4</a>, "mighty men." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Nephtoah</b></a>     Opened, a fountain and a stream issuing from it on the border between Judah and Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#008">Jos 15:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#009">Jos 15:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos018.htm#015">Jos 18:15</a>). It has been identified with  'Ain Lifta , a spring about 2 1/2 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Others, however, have identified it with 'Ain' Atan, on the south-west of Bethlehem, whence water is conveyed through "Pilate's aqueduct" to the Haram area at Jerusalem. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Ner</b></a>     Light, the father of Kish (<a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#033">Ch1 8:33</a>). <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#051">Sa1 14:51</a> should be read, "Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were the sons of Abiel." And hence this Kish and Ner were brothers, and Saul and Abner were first cousins (Compare <a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#036">Ch1 9:36</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Nereus</b></a>     A Christian at Rome to whom Paul sent his salutation (<a href="../kjv/rom016.htm#015">Rom 16:15</a>).
