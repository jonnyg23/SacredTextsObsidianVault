 <p><a name="000"><b>Muth-labben</b></a>     Occurring only in the title of Psalm 9, title. Some interpret the words as meaning "on the death of Labben," some unknown person. Others render the word, "on the death of the son;" i.e., of Absalom (<a href="../kjv/sa2018.htm#033">Sa2 18:33</a>). Others again have taken the word as the name of a musical instrument, or as the name of an air to which the psalm was sung.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Muzzle</b></a>     Grain in the East is usually thrashed by the sheaves being spread out on a floor, over which oxen and cattle are driven to and fro, till the grain is trodden out. Moses ordained that the ox was not to be muzzled while thrashing. It was to be allowed to eat both the grain and the straw (<a href="../kjv/deu025.htm#004">Deu 25:4</a>). (See AGRICULTURE.)

 <p><a name="002"><b>Myra</b></a>     One of the chief towns of Lycia, in Asia Minor, about 2 1/2 miles from the coast (<a href="../kjv/act027.htm#005">Act 27:5</a>). Here Paul removed from the Adramyttian ship in which he had sailed from Caesarea, and entered into the Alexandrian ship, which was afterwards wrecked at Melita (<a href="../kjv/act027.htm#039">Act 27:39</a>).

 <p><a name="003"><b>Myrrh</b></a>     Heb.  mor .     (1.) First mentioned as a principal ingredient in the holy anointing oil (<a href="../kjv/exo030.htm#023">Exo 30:23</a>). It formed part of the gifts brought by the wise men from the east, who came to worship the infant Jesus (<a href="../kjv/mat002.htm#011">Mat 2:11</a>). It was used in embalming (<a href="../kjv/joh019.htm#039">Joh 19:39</a>), also as a perfume (<a href="../kjv/est002.htm#012">Est 2:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa045.htm#008">Psa 45:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro007.htm#017">Pro 7:17</a>). It was a custom of the Jews to give those who were condemned to death by crucifixion "wine mingled with myrrh" to produce insensibility. This drugged wine was probably partaken of by the two malefactors, but when the Roman soldiers pressed it upon Jesus "he received it not" (<a href="../kjv/mar015.htm#023">Mar 15:23</a>). (See GALL.) This was the gum or viscid white liquid which flows from a tree resembling the acacia, found in Africa and Arabia, the Balsamodendron myrrha of botanists. The "bundle of myrrh" in <a href="../kjv/sol001.htm#013">Sol 1:13</a> is rather a "bag" of myrrh or a scent-bag. (2.) Another word  lot  is also translated "myrrh" (<a href="../kjv/gen037.htm#025">Gen 37:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen043.htm#011">Gen 43:11</a>; R.V., marg., "or ladanum"). What was meant by this word is uncertain. It has been thought to be the chestnut, mastich, stacte, balsam, turpentine, pistachio nut, or the lotus. It is probably correctly rendered by the Latin word  ladanum , the Arabic  ladan , an aromatic juice of a shrub called the Cistus or rock rose, which has the same qualities, though in a slight degree, of opium, whence a decoction of opium is called laudanum. This plant was indigenous to Syria and Arabia.

 <p><a name="004"><b>Myrtle</b></a>     <a href="../kjv/isa041.htm#019">Isa 41:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/neh008.htm#015">Neh 8:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#008">Zac 1:8</a>), Hebrew hadas, known in the East by the name as, the Myrtus communis of the botanist. "Although no myrtles are now found on the mount (of Olives), excepting in the gardens, yet they still exist in many of the glens about Jerusalem, where we have often seen its dark shining leaves and white flowers. There are many near Bethlehem and about Hebron, especially near Dewir Dan, the ancient Debir. It also sheds its fragrance on the sides of Carmel and of Tabor, and fringes the clefts of the Leontes in its course through Galilee. We meet with it all through Central Palestine" (Tristram).

 <p><a name="005"><b>Mysia</b></a>     A province in the north-west of Asia Minor. On his first voyage to Europe (<a href="../kjv/act016.htm#007">Act 16:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/act016.htm#008">Act 16:8</a>) Paul passed through this province and embarked at its chief port Troas.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Mystery</b></a>     The calling of the Gentiles into the Christian Church, so designated (<a href="../kjv/eph001.htm#009">Eph 1:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/eph001.htm#010">Eph 1:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph003.htm#008">Eph 3:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/col001.htm#025">Col 1:25</a>); a truth undiscoverable except by revelation, long hid, now made manifest. The resurrection of the dead (<a href="../kjv/co1015.htm#051">Co1 15:51</a>), and other doctrines which need to be explained but which cannot be fully understood by finite intelligence (<a href="../kjv/mat013.htm#011">Mat 13:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom011.htm#025">Rom 11:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1013.htm#002">Co1 13:2</a>); the union between Christ and his people symbolized by the marriage union (<a href="../kjv/eph005.htm#031">Eph 5:31</a>, <a href="../kjv/eph005.htm#032">Eph 5:32</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/eph006.htm#019">Eph 6:19</a>); the seven stars and the seven candlesticks (<a href="../kjv/rev001.htm#020">Rev 1:20</a>); and the woman clothed in scarlet (<a href="../kjv/rev017.htm#007">Rev 17:7</a>), are also in this sense mysteries. The anti-Christian power working in his day is called by the apostle (<a href="../kjv/th2002.htm#007">Th2 2:7</a>) the "mystery of iniquity."

 <p><a name="007"><b>Naam</b></a>     Pleasantness, one of the three sons of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh (<a href="../kjv/ch1004.htm#015">Ch1 4:15</a>).

The daughter of the king of Ammon, one of the wives of Solomon, the only one who appears to have borne him a son, viz., Rehoboam (<a href="../kjv/kg1014.htm#021">Kg1 14:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1014.htm#031">Kg1 14:31</a>).

 <p><a name="009"><b>Naaman</b></a>     Pleasantness, a Syrian, the commander of the armies of Benhadad II. in the time of Joram, king of Israel. He was afflicted with leprosy; and when the little Hebrew slave-girl that waited on his wife told her of a prophet in Samaria who could cure her master, he obtained a letter from Benhadad and proceeded with it to Joram. The king of Israel suspected in this some evil design against him, and rent his clothes. Elisha the prophet hearing of this, sent for Naaman, and the strange interview which took place is recorded in 2 Kings 5. The narrative contains all that is known of the Syrian commander. He was cured of his leprosy by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. His cure is alluded to by our Lord (<a href="../kjv/luk004.htm#027">Luk 4:27</a>).
