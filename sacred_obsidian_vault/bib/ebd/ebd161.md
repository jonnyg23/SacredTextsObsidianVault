 <p><a name="000"><b>Hammer</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  pattish , used by gold-beaters (<a href="../kjv/isa041.htm#007">Isa 41:7</a>) and by quarrymen (<a href="../kjv/jer023.htm#029">Jer 23:29</a>). Metaphorically of Babylon (<a href="../kjv/jer050.htm#023">Jer 50:23</a>) or Nebuchadnezzar. (2.) Heb.  makabah , a stone-cutter's mallet (<a href="../kjv/kg1006.htm#007">Kg1 6:7</a>), or of any workman (<a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#021">Jdg 4:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa044.htm#012">Isa 44:12</a>). (3.) Heb.  halmuth , a poetical word for a workman's hammer, found only in <a href="../kjv/jdg005.htm#026">Jdg 5:26</a>, where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad are driven into the ground. (4.) Heb.  mappets , rendered "battle-ax" in <a href="../kjv/jer051.htm#020">Jer 51:20</a>. This was properly a "mace," which is thus described by Rawlinson: "The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modeled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness."
