 <p><a name="000"><b>Ludim</b></a>     Probably the same as Lud (2) (Compare <a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#013">Gen 10:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#011">Ch1 1:11</a>). They are associated (<a href="../kjv/jer046.htm#009">Jer 46:9</a>) with African nations as mercenaries of the king of Egypt.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Luhith</b></a>     Made of boards, a Moabitish place between Zoar and Horonaim (<a href="../kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isa 15:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer048.htm#005">Jer 48:5</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Luke</b></a>     The evangelist, was a Gentile. The date and circumstances of his conversion are unknown. According to his own statement (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#002">Luk 1:2</a>), he was not an "eye-witness and minister of the word from the beginning." It is probable that he was a physician in Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he attached himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further after his release in his missionary journey at this time (<a href="../kjv/act017.htm#001">Act 17:1</a>). On Paul's third visit to Philippi (<a href="../kjv/act020.htm#005">Act 20:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/act020.htm#006">Act 20:6</a>) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was Paul's constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (Acts 20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul's imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome (<a href="../kjv/act027.htm#001">Act 27:1</a>), whither he accompanies him (<a href="../kjv/act028.htm#002">Act 28:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/act028.htm#012">Act 28:12</a>), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment (<a href="../kjv/plm001.htm#024">Plm 1:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/col004.htm#014">Col 4:14</a>). The last notice of the "beloved physician" is in <a href="../kjv/ti2004.htm#011">Ti2 4:11</a>. There are many passages in Paul's epistles, as well as in the writings of Luke, which show the extent and accuracy of his medical knowledge.

 <p><a name="003"><b>Luke, Gospel According to</b></a>     Was written by Luke. He does not claim to have been an eye-witness of our Lord's ministry, but to have gone to the best sources of information within his reach, and to have written an orderly narrative of the facts (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#001">Luk 1:1</a>). The authors of the first three Gospels, the synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote his independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Each writer has some things, both in matter and style, peculiar to himself, yet all the three have much in common. Luke's Gospel has been called "the Gospel of the nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by the love of a suffering Saviour;" "the Gospel of the saintly life;" "the Gospel for the Greeks; the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the gospel; the historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the good Physician and the Saviour of mankind;" the "Gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;" "the Gospel of womanhood;" "the Gospel of the outcast, of the Samaritan, the publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;" "the Gospel of tolerance." The main characteristic of this Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is fitfully expressed in the motto, "Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil" (<a href="../kjv/act010.htm#038">Act 10:38</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/luk004.htm#018">Luk 4:18</a>). Luke wrote for the "Hellenic world." This Gospel is indeed "rich and precious." "Out of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself. In many instances all three use identical language." (See MATTHEW; MARK; GOSPELS.) There are seventeen of our Lord's parables peculiar to this Gospel. (See Table Parables in the Gospels.) Luke also records seven of our Lord's miracles which are omitted by Matthew and Mark. (See Table Miracles Recorded in the Gospels.) The synoptical Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel be represented by 100, then when compared this result is obtained in the following table:                                                                                                         Synoptic Gospels Peculiarities Coincidences Total                                                                                                        Mark        07 93 100                                                                                                        Matthew         42 58 100                                                                                                        Luke        59 41 100        That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing the same things in very similar language. Luke's style is more finished and classical than that of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the Hebrew idiom. He uses a few Latin words (<a href="../kjv/luk012.htm#006">Luk 12:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk007.htm#041">Luk 7:41</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk008.htm#030">Luk 8:30</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk011.htm#033">Luk 11:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk019.htm#020">Luk 19:20</a>), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except  sikera , an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of grapes (from Heb.  shakar , "he is intoxicated", <a href="../kjv/lev010.htm#009">Lev 10:9</a>), probably palm wine. This Gospel contains twenty-eight distinct references to the Old Testament. The date of its composition is uncertain. It must have been written before the Acts, the date of the composition of which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64 A.D.. This Gospel was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63 A.D., when Luke may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was then a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was written at Rome during Paul's imprisonment there. But on this point no positive certainty can be attained. It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and phrases are common to both; see table:                       Compare With                     <a href="../kjv/luk004.htm#022">Luk 4:22</a> <a href="../kjv/col004.htm#006">Col 4:6</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk004.htm#032">Luk 4:32</a> <a href="../kjv/co1002.htm#004">Co1 2:4</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk006.htm#036">Luk 6:36</a> <a href="../kjv/co2001.htm#003">Co2 1:3</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk006.htm#039">Luk 6:39</a> <a href="../kjv/rom002.htm#019">Rom 2:19</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk009.htm#056">Luk 9:56</a> <a href="../kjv/co2010.htm#008">Co2 10:8</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk010.htm#008">Luk 10:8</a> <a href="../kjv/co1010.htm#027">Co1 10:27</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk011.htm#041">Luk 11:41</a> <a href="../kjv/tit001.htm#015">Tit 1:15</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk018.htm#001">Luk 18:1</a> <a href="../kjv/th2001.htm#011">Th2 1:11</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk021.htm#036">Luk 21:36</a> <a href="../kjv/eph006.htm#018">Eph 6:18</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk022.htm#019">Luk 22:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/luk022.htm#020">Luk 22:20</a> <a href="../kjv/co1011.htm#023">Co1 11:23</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk024.htm#046">Luk 24:46</a> <a href="../kjv/act017.htm#003">Act 17:3</a>                   <a href="../kjv/luk024.htm#034">Luk 24:34</a> <a href="../kjv/co1015.htm#005">Co1 15:5</a>

 <p><a name="004"><b>Lunatic</b></a>     Probably the same as epileptic, the symptoms of which disease were supposed to be more aggravated as the moon increased. In <a href="../kjv/mat004.htm#024">Mat 4:24</a> "lunatics" are distinguished from demoniacs. In <a href="../kjv/mat017.htm#015">Mat 17:15</a> the name "lunatic" is applied to one who is declared to have been possessed. (See DAEMONIAC.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Lust</b></a>     Sinful longing; the inward sin which leads to the falling away from God (<a href="../kjv/rom001.htm#021">Rom 1:21</a>). "Lust, the origin of sin, has its place in the heart, not of necessity, but because it is the centre of all moral forces and impulses and of spiritual activity." In <a href="../kjv/mar004.htm#019">Mar 4:19</a> "lusts" are objects of desire. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Luz</b></a>     A nut-bearing tree, the almond.     (1.) The ancient name of a royal Canaanitish city near the site of Bethel (<a href="../kjv/gen028.htm#019">Gen 28:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen035.htm#006">Gen 35:6</a>), on the border of Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/jos018.htm#013">Jos 18:13</a>). Here Jacob halted, and had a prophetic vision. (See BETHEL.) (2.) A place in the land of the Hittites, founded (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#026">Jdg 1:26</a>) by "a man who came forth out of the city of Luz." It is identified with Luweiziyeh, 4 miles north-west of Banias. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Lycaonia</b></a>     An inland province of Asia Minor, on the west of Cappadocia and the south of Galatia. It was a Roman province, and its chief towns were Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. The "speech of Lycaonia" (<a href="../kjv/act014.htm#011">Act 14:11</a>) was probably the ancient Assyrian language, or perhaps, as others think, a corrupt Greek intermingled with Syriac words. Paul preached in this region, and revisited it (<a href="../kjv/act016.htm#001">Act 16:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/act018.htm#023">Act 18:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/act019.htm#001">Act 19:1</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Lycia</b></a>     A wolf, a province in the south-west of Asia Minor, opposite the island of Rhodes. It forms part of the region now called Tekeh. It was a province of the Roman empire when visited by Paul (<a href="../kjv/act021.htm#001">Act 21:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/act027.htm#005">Act 27:5</a>). Two of its towns are mentioned, Patara (<a href="../kjv/act021.htm#001">Act 21:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/act021.htm#002">Act 21:2</a>) and Myra (<a href="../kjv/act027.htm#005">Act 27:5</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Lydda</b></a>     A town in the tribe of Ephraim, mentioned only in the New Testament (<a href="../kjv/act009.htm#032">Act 9:32</a>, <a href="../kjv/act009.htm#035">Act 9:35</a>, <a href="../kjv/act009.htm#038">Act 9:38</a>) as the scene of Peter's miracle in healing the paralytic Aeneas. It lay about 9 miles east of Joppa, on the road from the sea-port to Jerusalem. In the Old Testament (<a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#012">Ch1 8:12</a>) it is called Lod. It was burned by the Romans, but was afterwards rebuilt, and was known by the name of Diospolis. Its modern name is Ludd. The so-called patron saint of England, St. George, is said to have been born here.
