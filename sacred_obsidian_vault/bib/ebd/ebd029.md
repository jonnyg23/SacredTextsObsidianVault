 <p><a name="000"><b>Arch</b></a>     An architectural term found only in <a href="../kjv/eze040.htm#016">Eze 40:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze040.htm#021">Eze 40:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze040.htm#022">Eze 40:22</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze040.htm#026">Eze 40:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze040.htm#029">Eze 40:29</a>. There is no absolute proof that the Israelites employed arches in their buildings. The arch was employed in the building of the pyramids of Egypt. The oldest existing arch is at Thebes, and bears the date 1350 B.C.. There are also still found the remains of an arch, known as Robinson's Arch, of the bridge connecting Zion and Moriah. (See TYROPOEON VALLEY.)

 <p><a name="001"><b>Archelaus</b></a>     Ruler of the people, son of Herod the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was educated along with his brother Antipas at Rome. He inherited from his father a third part of his kingdom viz., Idumea, Judea, and Samaria, and hence is called "king" (<a href="../kjv/mat002.htm#022">Mat 2:22</a>). It was for fear of him that Joseph and Mary turned aside on their way back from Egypt. Till a few days before his death Herod had named Antipas as his successor, but in his last moments he named Archelaus.

 <p><a name="002"><b>Archer</b></a>     A shooter with the bow (<a href="../kjv/ch1010.htm#003">Ch1 10:3</a>). This art was of high antiquity (<a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#020">Gen 21:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen027.htm#003">Gen 27:3</a>). Saul was wounded by the Philistine archers (<a href="../kjv/sa1031.htm#003">Sa1 31:3</a>). The phrase "breaking the bow" (<a href="../kjv/hos001.htm#005">Hos 1:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer049.htm#035">Jer 49:35</a>) is equivalent to taking away one's power, while "strengthening the bow" is a symbol of its increase (<a href="../kjv/gen049.htm#024">Gen 49:24</a>). The Persian archers were famous among the ancients (<a href="../kjv/isa013.htm#018">Isa 13:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer049.htm#035">Jer 49:35</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer050.htm#009">Jer 50:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer050.htm#014">Jer 50:14</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer050.htm#029">Jer 50:29</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer050.htm#042">Jer 50:42</a>. (See Bow).

 <p><a name="003"><b>Archevite</b></a>     One of the nations planted by the Assyrians in Samaria (<a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#009">Ezr 4:9</a>); the men of Erech. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Archi</b></a>     A city on the boundary of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/jos016.htm#002">Jos 16:2</a>), between Bethel and Beth-horon the nether. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Archippus</b></a>     Master of the horse, a "fellow-soldier" of Paul's (<a href="../kjv/plm001.htm#002">Plm 1:2</a>), whom he exhorts to renewed activity (<a href="../kjv/col004.htm#017">Col 4:17</a>). He was a member of Philemon's family, probably his son. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Archite</b></a>     The usual designation of Hushai (<a href="../kjv/sa2015.htm#032">Sa2 15:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2017.htm#005">Sa2 17:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2017.htm#014">Sa2 17:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#033">Ch1 27:33</a>), who was a native of Archi. He was "the king's friend", i.e., he held office under David similar to that of our modern privy councilor. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Arcturus</b></a>     Bear-keeper, the name given by the ancients to the brightest star in the constellation Bootes. In the Authorized Version (<a href="../kjv/job009.htm#009">Job 9:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/job038.htm#032">Job 38:32</a>) it is the rendering of the Hebrew word  'ash , which probably designates the constellation the Great Bear. This word ( 'ash ) is supposed to be derived from an Arabic word meaning nightwatcher, because the Great Bear always revolves about the pole, and to our northern hemisphere never sets.

 <p><a name="008"><b>Ard</b></a>     Descent, a grandson of Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/num026.htm#038">Num 26:38</a>). In <a href="../kjv/ch1008.htm#003">Ch1 8:3</a> he is called Addar. His descendants are mentioned in <a href="../kjv/num026.htm#040">Num 26:40</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Ardon</b></a>     Descendant, the last of the three sons of Caleb by his first wife Azubah (<a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#018">Ch1 2:18</a>).
