 <p><a name="000"><b>Adina</b></a>     Slender, one of David's warriors (<a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#042">Ch1 11:42</a>), a Reubenite. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Adino</b></a>     The Eznite, one of David's mighty men (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#008">Sa2 23:8</a>). (See JASHOBEAM.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Adjuration</b></a>     A solemn appeal whereby one person imposes on another the obligation of speaking or acting as if under an oath (<a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#024">Sa1 14:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos006.htm#026">Jos 6:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#016">Kg1 22:16</a>). We have in the New Testament a striking example of this (<a href="../kjv/mat026.htm#063">Mat 26:63</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar005.htm#007">Mar 5:7</a>), where the high priest calls upon Christ to avow his true character. It would seem that in such a case the person so adjured could not refuse to give an answer. The word "adjure", i.e., cause to swear is used with reference to the casting out of demons (<a href="../kjv/act019.htm#013">Act 19:13</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Admah</b></a>     Earth, one of the five cities of the vale of Siddim (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#019">Gen 10:19</a>). It was destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="../kjv/gen019.htm#024">Gen 19:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu029.htm#023">Deu 29:23</a>). It is supposed by some to be the same as the Adam of <a href="../kjv/jos003.htm#016">Jos 3:16</a>, the name of which still lingers in Damieh, the ford of Jordan. (See ZEBOIM.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Adnah</b></a>     Delight.     (1.) A chief of the tribe of Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="../kjv/ch1012.htm#020">Ch1 12:20</a>). (2.) A general under Jehoshaphat, chief over 300,000 men (<a href="../kjv/ch2017.htm#014">Ch2 17:14</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Adonibezek</b></a>     Lord of Bezek, a Canaanitish king who, having subdued seventy of the chiefs that were around him, made an attack against the armies of Judah and Simeon, but was defeated and brought as a captive to Jerusalem, where his thumbs and great toes were cut off. He confessed that God had requited him for his like cruelty to the seventy kings whom he had subdued (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#004">Jdg 1:4</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/sa1015.htm#033">Sa1 15:33</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Adonijah</b></a>     My Lord is Jehovah.     (1.) The fourth son of David (<a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#004">Sa2 3:4</a>). After the death of his elder brothers, Amnon and Absalom, he became heir-apparent to the throne. But Solomon, a younger brother, was preferred to him. Adonijah, however, when his father was dying, caused himself to be proclaimed king. But Nathan and Bathsheba induced David to give orders that Solomon should at once be proclaimed and admitted to the throne. Adonijah fled and took refuge at the altar, and received pardon for his conduct from Solomon on the condition that he showed himself "a worthy man" (1 Kings 1:5-53). He afterwards made a second attempt to gain the throne, but was seized and put to death (<a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#013">Kg1 2:13</a>). (2.) A Levite sent with the princes to teach the book of the law to the inhabitants of Judah (<a href="../kjv/ch2017.htm#008">Ch2 17:8</a>). (3.) One of the "chiefs of the people" after the Captivity (<a href="../kjv/neh010.htm#016">Neh 10:16</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Adonikam</b></a>     Whom the Lord sets up, one of those "which came with Zerubbabel" (<a href="../kjv/ezr002.htm#013">Ezr 2:13</a>). His "children," or retainers, to the number of 666, came up to Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/ezr008.htm#013">Ezr 8:13</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Adoniram</b></a>     (Adoram <a href="../kjv/kg1012.htm#018">Kg1 12:18</a>), the son of Abda, was "over the tribute," i.e., the levy or forced labour. He was stoned to death by the people of Israel (<a href="../kjv/kg1004.htm#006">Kg1 4:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1005.htm#014">Kg1 5:14</a>) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Adoni-zedec</b></a>     Lord of justice or righteousness was king in Jerusalem at the time when the Israelites invaded Palestine (<a href="../kjv/jos010.htm#001">Jos 10:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos010.htm#003">Jos 10:3</a>). He formed a confederacy with the other Canaanitish kings against the Israelites, but was utterly routed by Joshua when he was engaged in besieging the Gibeonites. The history of this victory and of the treatment of the five confederated kings is recorded in Josh. 10:1-27. (Compare <a href="../kjv/deu021.htm#023">Deu 21:23</a>). Among the Tell Amarna tablets (see EGYPT) are some very interesting letters from Adoni-zedec to the King of Egypt. These illustrate in a very remarkable manner the history recorded in Josh. 10, and indeed throw light on the wars of conquest generally, so that they may be read as a kind of commentary on the book of Joshua. Here the conquering career of the Abiri (i.e., Hebrews) is graphically described: "Behold, I say that the land of the king my lord is ruined"," The wars are mighty against me", "The Hebrew chiefs plunder all the king's lands", "Behold, I the chief of the Amorites am breaking to pieces." Then he implores the king of Egypt to send soldiers to help him, directing that the army should come by sea to Ascalon or Gaza, and thence march to Wru-sa-lin (Jerusalem) by the valley of Elah.
