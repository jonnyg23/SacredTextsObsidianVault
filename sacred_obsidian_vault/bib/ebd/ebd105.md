 <p><a name="000"><b>Divorce</b></a>     The dissolution of the marriage tie was regulated by the Mosaic law (<a href="../kjv/deu024.htm#001">Deu 24:1</a>). The Jews, after the Captivity, were required to dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the law (<a href="../kjv/ezr010.htm#011">Ezr 10:11</a>). Christ limited the permission of divorce to the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon for the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight pretenses (<a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#031">Mat 5:31</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#032">Mat 5:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat019.htm#001">Mat 19:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar010.htm#002">Mar 10:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk016.htm#018">Luk 16:18</a>). These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Dizahab</b></a>     Region of gold, a place in the desert of Sinai, on the western shore of the Elanitic gulf (<a href="../kjv/deu001.htm#001">Deu 1:1</a>). It is now called Dehab. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Doctor</b></a>     <a href="../kjv/luk002.htm#046">Luk 2:46</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk005.htm#017">Luk 5:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/act005.htm#034">Act 5:34</a>), a teacher. The Jewish doctors taught and disputed in synagogues, or wherever they could find an audience. Their disciples were allowed to propose to them questions. They assumed the office without any appointment to it. The doctors of the law were principally of the sect of the Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction of Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical degrees were conferred on those who passed a certain examination. Those of the school of Tiberias were called by the title "rabbi," and those of Babylon by that of "master." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Dodai</b></a>     Loving, one of David's captains (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#004">Ch1 27:4</a>). (See DODO [2].) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Dodanim</b></a>     Leaders, a race descended from Javan (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#004">Gen 10:4</a>). They are known in profane history as the Dardani, originally inhabiting Illyricum. They were a semi-Pelasgic race, and in the ethnographical table (Gen. 10) they are grouped with the Chittim (q.v.). In <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#007">Ch1 1:7</a>, they are called Rodanim. The LXX. and the Samaritan Version also read Rhodii, whence some have concluded that the Rhodians, the inhabitants of the island of Rhodes, are meant. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Dodo</b></a>     Amatory; loving.     (1.) A descendant of Issachar (<a href="../kjv/jdg010.htm#001">Jdg 10:1</a>). (2.) An Ahohite, father of Eleazar, who was one of David's three heroes (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#009">Sa2 23:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#012">Ch1 11:12</a>). He was the same with Dodai mentioned in <a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#004">Ch1 27:4</a>. (3.) A Bethlehemite, and father of Elhanan, who was one of David's thirty heroes (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#024">Sa2 23:24</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Doeg</b></a>     Fearful, an Edomite, the chief overseer of Saul's flocks (<a href="../kjv/sa1021.htm#007">Sa1 21:7</a>). At the command of Saul he slew the high priest Ahimelech (q.v.) at Nob, together with all the priests to the number of eighty-five persons. (Compare <a href="../kjv/psa052.htm#001">Psa 52:1</a>, title.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Dog</b></a>     Frequently mentioned both in the Old and New Testaments. Dogs were used by the Hebrews as a watch for their houses (<a href="../kjv/isa056.htm#010">Isa 56:10</a>), and for guarding their flocks (<a href="../kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1</a>). There were also then as now troops of semi-wild dogs that wandered about devouring dead bodies and the offal of the streets (<a href="../kjv/kg1014.htm#011">Kg1 14:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1016.htm#004">Kg1 16:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1021.htm#019">Kg1 21:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1021.htm#023">Kg1 21:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#038">Kg1 22:38</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa059.htm#006">Psa 59:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/psa059.htm#014">Psa 59:14</a>). As the dog was an unclean animal, the terms "dog," "dog's head," "dead dog," were used as terms of reproach or of humiliation (<a href="../kjv/sa1024.htm#014">Sa1 24:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#008">Sa2 3:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2009.htm#008">Sa2 9:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2016.htm#009">Sa2 16:9</a>). Paul calls false apostles "dogs" (<a href="../kjv/phi003.htm#002">Phi 3:2</a>). Those who are shut out of the kingdom of heaven are also so designated (<a href="../kjv/rev022.htm#015">Rev 22:15</a>). Persecutors are called "dogs" (<a href="../kjv/psa022.htm#016">Psa 22:16</a>). Hazael's words, "Thy servant which is but a dog" (<a href="../kjv/kg2008.htm#013">Kg2 8:13</a>), are spoken in mock humility = impossible that one so contemptible as he should attain to such power. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Doleful Creatures</b></a>     (occurring only <a href="../kjv/isa013.htm#021">Isa 13:21</a>. Heb.  ochim , i.e., "shrieks;" hence "howling animals"), a general name for screech owls (howlets), which occupy the desolate palaces of Babylon. Some render the word "hyenas." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Doors</b></a>     Moved on pivots of wood fastened in sockets above and below (<a href="../kjv/pro026.htm#014">Pro 26:14</a>). They were fastened by a lock (<a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#023">Jdg 3:23</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#025">Jdg 3:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/sol005.htm#005">Sol 5:5</a>) or by a bar (<a href="../kjv/jdg016.htm#003">Jdg 16:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/job038.htm#010">Job 38:10</a>). In the interior of Oriental houses, curtains were frequently used instead of doors. The entrances of the tabernacle had curtains (<a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#031">Exo 26:31</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#036">Exo 26:36</a>). The "valley of Achor" is called a "door of hope," because immediately after the execution of Achan the Lord said to Joshua, "Fear not," and from that time Joshua went forward in a career of uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a "door opened" for the spread of the gospel (<a href="../kjv/co1016.htm#009">Co1 16:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/co2002.htm#012">Co2 2:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/col004.htm#003">Col 4:3</a>). Our Lord says of himself, "I am the door" (<a href="../kjv/joh010.htm#009">Joh 10:9</a>). John (<a href="../kjv/rev004.htm#001">Rev 4:1</a>) speaks of a "door opened in heaven."
