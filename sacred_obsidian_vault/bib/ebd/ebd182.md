 <p><a name="000"><b>Horem</b></a>     Consecrated, one of the fenced cities of Naphtali (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#038">Jos 19:38</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Horites</b></a>     Cave-men, a race of Troglodytes who dwelt in the limestone caves which abounded in Edom. Their ancestor was "Seir," who probably gave his name to the district where he lived. They were a branch of the Hivites (<a href="../kjv/gen014.htm#006">Gen 14:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#020">Gen 36:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#038">Ch1 1:38</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#039">Ch1 1:39</a>). They were dispossessed by the descendants of Esau, and as a people gradually became extinct (<a href="../kjv/deu002.htm#012">Deu 2:12</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Hormah</b></a>     Banning; i.e., placing under a "ban," or devoting to utter destruction. After the manifestation of God's anger against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up "to the head of the mountain," seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the Lord, without the ark of the covenant, and without Moses. The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and "smote and discomfited them even unto Hormah" (<a href="../kjv/num014.htm#045">Num 14:45</a>). This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#017">Jdg 1:17</a>), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards (<a href="../kjv/num021.htm#001">Num 21:1</a>) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh, "fought against them, and took some of them prisoners." But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they "banned" them, and hence the place was now called Hormah. But this "ban" was not fully executed till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became "Hormah" (<a href="../kjv/jos012.htm#014">Jos 12:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#017">Jdg 1:17</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Horn</b></a>     Trumpets were at first horns perforated at the tip, used for various purposes (<a href="../kjv/jos006.htm#004">Jos 6:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos006.htm#005">Jos 6:5</a>). Flasks or vessels were made of horn (<a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#001">Sa1 16:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#013">Sa1 16:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1001.htm#039">Kg1 1:39</a>). But the word is used also metaphorically to denote the projecting corners of the altar of burnt offerings (<a href="../kjv/exo027.htm#002">Exo 27:2</a>) and of incense (<a href="../kjv/exo030.htm#002">Exo 30:2</a>). The horns of the altar of burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock (<a href="../kjv/exo029.htm#012">Exo 29:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev004.htm#007">Lev 4:7</a>). The criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the horns of the altar (<a href="../kjv/kg1001.htm#050">Kg1 1:50</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#028">Kg1 2:28</a>). The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill (<a href="../kjv/isa005.htm#001">Isa 5:1</a>, where the word "hill" is the rendering of the same Hebrew word). This word is used metaphorically also for strength (<a href="../kjv/deu033.htm#017">Deu 33:17</a>) and honour (<a href="../kjv/job016.htm#015">Job 16:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/lam002.htm#003">Lam 2:3</a>). Horns are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the chief means of attack and defense with the animals endowed with them (<a href="../kjv/dan008.htm#005">Dan 8:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/dan008.htm#009">Dan 8:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#001">Sa1 2:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#001">Sa1 16:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#013">Sa1 16:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1001.htm#039">Kg1 1:39</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#011">Kg1 22:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos006.htm#004">Jos 6:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos006.htm#005">Jos 6:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa075.htm#005">Psa 75:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/psa075.htm#010">Psa 75:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa132.htm#017">Psa 132:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#069">Luk 1:69</a>, etc.). The expression "horn of salvation," applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a strong Saviour (<a href="../kjv/luk001.htm#069">Luk 1:69</a>). To have the horn "exalted" denotes prosperity and triumph (<a href="../kjv/psa089.htm#017">Psa 89:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/psa089.htm#024">Psa 89:24</a>). To "lift up" the horn is to act proudly (<a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#021">Zac 1:21</a>). Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power (<a href="../kjv/jer048.htm#025">Jer 48:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#018">Zac 1:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/dan008.htm#024">Dan 8:24</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Hornet</b></a>     Heb.  tsir'ah , "stinging", (<a href="../kjv/exo023.htm#028">Exo 23:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu007.htm#020">Deu 7:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos024.htm#012">Jos 24:12</a>). The word is used in these passages as referring to some means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out from before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is used in a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic which would seize the people as a "terror of God" (<a href="../kjv/gen035.htm#005">Gen 35:5</a>), the consternation with which God would inspire the Canaanites. In Palestine there are four species of hornets, differing from our hornets, being larger in size, and they are very abundant. They "attack human beings in a very furious manner." "The furious attack of a swarm of hornets drives cattle and horses to madness, and has even caused the death of the animals."

 <p><a name="005"><b>Horonaim</b></a>     Two caverns, a city of Moab to the south of the Arnon, built, apparently, upon an eminence, and a place of some importance (<a href="../kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isa 15:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer048.htm#003">Jer 48:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer048.htm#005">Jer 48:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/jer048.htm#034">Jer 48:34</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Horonite</b></a>     The designation of Sanballat (<a href="../kjv/neh002.htm#010">Neh 2:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/neh002.htm#019">Neh 2:19</a>), a native of Horonaim, or of one of the two Beth-horons, the "upper" or the "nether," mentioned in <a href="../kjv/jos016.htm#003">Jos 16:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/jos016.htm#005">Jos 16:5</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Horse</b></a>     Always referred to in the Bible in connection with warlike operations, except <a href="../kjv/isa028.htm#028">Isa 28:28</a>. The war-horse is described <a href="../kjv/job039.htm#019">Job 39:19</a>. For a long period after their settlement in Canaan the Israelites made no use of horses, according to the prohibition, <a href="../kjv/deu017.htm#016">Deu 17:16</a>. David was the first to form a force of cavalry (<a href="../kjv/sa2008.htm#004">Sa2 8:4</a>). But Solomon, from his connection with Egypt, greatly multiplied their number (<a href="../kjv/kg1004.htm#026">Kg1 4:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#029">Kg1 10:29</a>). After this, horses were freely used in Israel (<a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#004">Kg1 22:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2003.htm#007">Kg2 3:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#021">Kg2 9:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#033">Kg2 9:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2011.htm#016">Kg2 11:16</a>). The furniture of the horse consisted simply of a bridle (<a href="../kjv/isa030.htm#028">Isa 30:28</a>) and a curb (<a href="../kjv/psa032.htm#009">Psa 32:9</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Horse-gate</b></a>     A gate in the wall of Jerusalem, at the west end of the bridge, leading from Zion to the temple (<a href="../kjv/neh003.htm#028">Neh 3:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer031.htm#040">Jer 31:40</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Horse-leech</b></a>     Occurs only in <a href="../kjv/pro030.htm#015">Pro 30:15</a> (Heb.  'alukah ); the generic name for any blood-sucking annelid. There are various species in the marshes and pools of Palestine. That here referred to, the Hoemopis, is remarkable for the coarseness of its bite, and is therefore not used for medical purposes. They are spoken of in the East with feelings of aversion and horror, because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and nostrils of horses when they come to drink out of the pools. The medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis), besides other species of leeches, are common in the waters of Syria.
