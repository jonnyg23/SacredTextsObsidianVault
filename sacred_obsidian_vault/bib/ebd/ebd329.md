 <p><a name="000"><b>Serpent, Fiery</b></a>     (LXX. "deadly," Vulg. "burning"), <a href="../kjv/num021.htm#006">Num 21:6</a>, probably the naja haje of Egypt; some swift-springing, deadly snake (<a href="../kjv/isa014.htm#029">Isa 14:29</a>). After setting out from their encampment at Ezion-gaber, the Israelites entered on a wide sandy desert, which stretches from the mountains of Edom as far as the Persian Gulf. While traversing this region, the people began to murmur and utter loud complaints against Moses. As a punishment, the Lord sent serpents among them, and much people of Israel died. Moses interceded on their behalf, and by divine direction he made a "brazen serpent," and raised it on a pole in the midst of the camp, and all the wounded Israelites who looked on it were at once healed. (Compare <a href="../kjv/joh003.htm#014">Joh 3:14</a>, <a href="../kjv/joh003.htm#015">Joh 3:15</a>.) (See ASP.) This "brazen serpent" was preserved by the Israelites till the days of Hezekiah, when it was destroyed (<a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#004">Kg2 18:4</a>). (See BRASS.)

 <p><a name="001"><b>Serug</b></a>     Branch, the father of Nahor (<a href="../kjv/gen011.htm#020">Gen 11:20</a>); called Saruch in <a href="../kjv/luk003.htm#035">Luk 3:35</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Servitor</b></a>     Occurs only in <a href="../kjv/kg2004.htm#043">Kg2 4:43</a>, Authorized Version (R.V., "servant"). The Hebrew word there rendered "servitor" is elsewhere rendered "minister," "servant" (<a href="../kjv/exo024.htm#013">Exo 24:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo033.htm#011">Exo 33:11</a>). Probably Gehazi, the personal attendant on Elisha, is here meant. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Seth</b></a>     Appointed; a substitute, the third son of Adam and Eve (<a href="../kjv/gen004.htm#025">Gen 4:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen005.htm#003">Gen 5:3</a>). His mother gave him this name, "for God," said she, "hath appointed me [i.e., compensated me with] another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Sethur</b></a>     Hidden, one of the spies sent to search the Promised Land. He was of the tribe of Asher (<a href="../kjv/num013.htm#013">Num 13:13</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Seven</b></a>     This number occurs frequently in Scripture, and in such connections as lead to the supposition that it has some typical meaning. On the seventh day God rested, and hallowed it (<a href="../kjv/gen002.htm#002">Gen 2:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen002.htm#003">Gen 2:3</a>). The division of time into weeks of seven days each accounts for many instances of the occurrence of this number. This number has been called the symbol of perfection, and also the symbol of rest. "Jacob's seven years' service to Laban; Pharaoh's seven fat oxen and seven lean ones; the seven branches of the golden candlestick; who sounded them; the seven days' siege of Jericho; the seven churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven seals, seven vials, and many others, sufficiently prove the importance of this sacred number" (see <a href="../kjv/lev025.htm#004">Lev 25:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#005">Sa1 2:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa012.htm#006">Psa 12:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa079.htm#012">Psa 79:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro026.htm#016">Pro 26:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa004.htm#001">Isa 4:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat018.htm#021">Mat 18:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat018.htm#022">Mat 18:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk017.htm#004">Luk 17:4</a>). The feast of Passover (<a href="../kjv/exo012.htm#015">Exo 12:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo012.htm#016">Exo 12:16</a>), the feast of Weeks (<a href="../kjv/deu016.htm#009">Deu 16:9</a>), of Tabernacles (<a href="../kjv/deu013.htm#015">Deu 13:15</a>), and the Jubilee (<a href="../kjv/lev025.htm#008">Lev 25:8</a>), were all ordered by seven. Seven is the number of sacrifice (<a href="../kjv/ch2029.htm#021">Ch2 29:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/job042.htm#008">Job 42:8</a>), of purification and consecration (<a href="../kjv/lev004.htm#006">Lev 4:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev004.htm#017">Lev 4:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev008.htm#011">Lev 8:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev008.htm#033">Lev 8:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev014.htm#009">Lev 14:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev014.htm#051">Lev 14:51</a>), of forgiveness (<a href="../kjv/mat018.htm#021">Mat 18:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat018.htm#022">Mat 18:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk017.htm#004">Luk 17:4</a>), of reward (<a href="../kjv/deu028.htm#007">Deu 28:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#005">Sa1 2:5</a>), and of punishment (<a href="../kjv/lev026.htm#021">Lev 26:21</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev026.htm#024">Lev 26:24</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev026.htm#028">Lev 26:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu028.htm#025">Deu 28:25</a>). It is used for any round number in such passages as <a href="../kjv/job005.htm#019">Job 5:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro026.htm#016">Pro 26:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/pro026.htm#025">Pro 26:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa004.htm#001">Isa 4:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat012.htm#045">Mat 12:45</a>. It is used also to mean "abundantly" (<a href="../kjv/gen004.htm#015">Gen 4:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen004.htm#024">Gen 4:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev026.htm#024">Lev 26:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa079.htm#012">Psa 79:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Seventy Weeks</b></a>     A prophetic period mentioned in <a href="../kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</a>, and usually interpreted on the "year-day" theory, i.e., reckoning each day for a year. This period will thus represent 490 years. This is regarded as the period which would elapse till the time of the coming of the Messiah, dating "from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem" i.e., from the close of the Captivity. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Shaalabbin</b></a>     Or Shaalbim, a place of foxes, a town of the tribe of Dan (<a href="../kjv/jos019.htm#042">Jos 19:42</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#035">Jdg 1:35</a>). It was one of the chief towns from which Solomon drew his supplies (<a href="../kjv/kg1004.htm#009">Kg1 4:9</a>). It is probably the modern village of Selbit, 3 miles north of Ajalon. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Shaaraim</b></a>     Two gates.     (1.) A city in the plain of Judah (<a href="../kjv/sa1017.htm#052">Sa1 17:52</a>); called also Sharaim (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#036">Jos 15:36</a>). (2.) A town in Simeon (<a href="../kjv/ch1004.htm#031">Ch1 4:31</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Shaashgaz</b></a>     Servant of the beautiful, a chief eunuch in the second house of the harem of king Ahasuerus (<a href="../kjv/est002.htm#014">Est 2:14</a>).
