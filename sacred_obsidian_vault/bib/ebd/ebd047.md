 <p><a name="000"><b>Bastard</b></a>     In the Old Testament the rendering of the Hebrew word  mamzer' , which means "polluted." In <a href="../kjv/deu023.htm#002">Deu 23:2</a>, it occurs in the ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In <a href="../kjv/zac009.htm#006">Zac 9:6</a>, the word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among the Jews (<a href="../kjv/jdg011.htm#001">Jdg 11:1</a>). In <a href="../kjv/heb012.htm#008">Heb 12:8</a>, the word (Gr.  nothoi ) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who do not share the privileges of God's children. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Bastinado</b></a>     Beating, a mode of punishment common in the East. It is referred to by "the rod of correction" (<a href="../kjv/pro022.htm#015">Pro 22:15</a>), "scourging" (<a href="../kjv/lev019.htm#020">Lev 19:20</a>), "chastising" (<a href="../kjv/deu022.htm#018">Deu 22:18</a>). The number of blows could not exceed forty (<a href="../kjv/deu025.htm#002">Deu 25:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/deu025.htm#003">Deu 25:3</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Bat</b></a>     The Hebrew word ( atalleph' ) so rendered (<a href="../kjv/lev011.htm#019">Lev 11:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu014.htm#018">Deu 14:18</a>) implies "flying in the dark." The bat is reckoned among the birds in the list of unclean animals. To cast idols to the "moles and to the bats" means to carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which these animals resort (<a href="../kjv/isa002.htm#020">Isa 2:20</a>), i.e., to consign them to desolation or ruin. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Bath</b></a>     A Hebrew liquid measure, the tenth part of an homer (<a href="../kjv/kg1007.htm#026">Kg1 7:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1007.htm#038">Kg1 7:38</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze045.htm#010">Eze 45:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze045.htm#014">Eze 45:14</a>). It contained 8 gallons 3 quarts of our measure. "Ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath" (<a href="../kjv/isa005.htm#010">Isa 5:10</a>) denotes great unproductiveness. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Baths</b></a>     The use of the bath was very frequent among the Hebrews (<a href="../kjv/lev014.htm#008">Lev 14:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/num019.htm#019">Num 19:19</a>, etc.). The high priest at his inauguration (<a href="../kjv/lev008.htm#006">Lev 8:6</a>), and on the day of atonement, was required to bathe himself (<a href="../kjv/lev016.htm#004">Lev 16:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev016.htm#024">Lev 16:24</a>). The "pools" mentioned in <a href="../kjv/neh003.htm#015">Neh 3:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/neh003.htm#016">Neh 3:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2020.htm#020">Kg2 20:20</a>, <a href="../kjv/isa022.htm#011">Isa 22:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/joh009.htm#007">Joh 9:7</a>, were public bathing-places. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Bath-rabbim</b></a>     Daughter of many, the name of one of the gates of the city of Heshbon, near which were pools (<a href="../kjv/sol007.htm#004">Sol 7:4</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Bath-sheba</b></a>     Daughter of the oath, or of seven, called also  Bath-shu'a  (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#005">Ch1 3:5</a>), was the daughter of Eliam (<a href="../kjv/sa2011.htm#003">Sa2 11:3</a>) or Ammiel (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#005">Ch1 3:5</a>), and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David committed adultery with her (<a href="../kjv/sa2011.htm#004">Sa2 11:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2011.htm#005">Sa2 11:5</a>; Ps. 51, title). The child born in adultery died (<a href="../kjv/sa2012.htm#015">Sa2 12:15</a>). After her husband was slain (<a href="../kjv/sa2011.htm#015">Sa2 11:15</a>) she was married to David (<a href="../kjv/sa2011.htm#027">Sa2 11:27</a>), and became the mother of Solomon (<a href="../kjv/sa2012.htm#024">Sa2 12:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1001.htm#011">Kg1 1:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#013">Kg1 2:13</a>).

The end of it which was brought against the wall was shaped like a ram's head. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Battle-axe</b></a>     A mallet or heavy war-club. Applied metaphorically (<a href="../kjv/jer051.htm#020">Jer 51:20</a>) to Cyrus, God's instrument in destroying Babylon.            
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Battle-bow</b></a>     The war-bow used in fighting (<a href="../kjv/zac009.htm#010">Zac 9:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/zac010.htm#004">Zac 10:4</a>). "Thy bow was made quite naked" (<a href="../kjv/hab003.htm#009">Hab 3:9</a>) means that it was made ready for use. By David's order (<a href="../kjv/sa2001.htm#018">Sa2 1:18</a>) the young men were taught the use, or rather the song of the bow. (See ARMOUR, BOW.)
