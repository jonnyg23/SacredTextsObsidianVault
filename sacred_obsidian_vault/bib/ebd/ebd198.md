 <p><a name="000"><b>Jashobeam</b></a>     Dweller among the people; or to whom the people turn, the Hachmonite (<a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#011">Ch1 11:11</a>), one of David's chief heroes who joined him at Ziklag (<a href="../kjv/ch1012.htm#006">Ch1 12:6</a>). He was the first of the three who broke through the host of the Philistines to fetch water to David from the well of Bethlehem (<a href="../kjv/sa2023.htm#013">Sa2 23:13</a>). He is also called Adino the Eznite (8).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Jason</b></a>     He that will cure, the host of Paul and Silas in Thessalonica. The Jews assaulted his house in order to seize Paul, but failing to find him, they dragged Jason before the ruler of the city (<a href="../kjv/act017.htm#005">Act 17:5</a>). He was apparently one of the kinsmen of Paul (<a href="../kjv/rom016.htm#021">Rom 16:21</a>), and accompanied him from Thessalonica to Corinth. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Jasper</b></a>     (Heb.  yashpheh , "glittering"), a gem of various colours, one of the twelve inserted in the high priest's breast-plate (<a href="../kjv/exo028.htm#020">Exo 28:20</a>). It is named in the building of the New Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#018">Rev 21:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#019">Rev 21:19</a>). It was "most precious," "clear as crystal" (<a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#011">Rev 21:11</a>). It was emblematic of the glory of God (<a href="../kjv/rev004.htm#003">Rev 4:3</a>).

 <p><a name="004"><b>Jattir</b></a>     Pre-eminent, a city in the mountains of Judah (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#048">Jos 15:48</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos021.htm#014">Jos 21:14</a>).

 <p><a name="005"><b>Javan</b></a>      (1.) The fourth "son" of Japheth (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#002">Gen 10:2</a>), whose descendants settled in Greece, i.e., Ionia, which bears the name of Javan in Hebrew. Alexander the Great is called the "king of Javan" (rendered "Grecia," <a href="../kjv/dan008.htm#021">Dan 8:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/dan010.htm#020">Dan 10:20</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/dan011.htm#002">Dan 11:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/zac009.htm#013">Zac 9:13</a>). This word was universally used by the nations of the East as the generic name of the Greek race. (2.) A town or district of Arabia Felix, from which the Syrians obtained iron, cassia, and calamus (<a href="../kjv/eze027.htm#019">Eze 27:19</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Javelin</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  hanith , a lance, from its flexibility (<a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#010">Sa1 18:10</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#011">Sa1 18:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1019.htm#009">Sa1 19:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1019.htm#010">Sa1 19:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1020.htm#033">Sa1 20:33</a>). (2.) Heb.  romah , a lance for heavy-armed troops, so called from its piercing (<a href="../kjv/num025.htm#007">Num 25:7</a>). (See ARMS.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Jaw-bone</b></a>     Of an ass afforded Samson a weapon for the great slaughter of the Philistines (<a href="../kjv/jdg015.htm#015">Jdg 15:15</a>), in which he slew a thousand men. In <a href="../kjv/jdg015.htm#019">Jdg 15:19</a> the Authorized Version reads, "God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout." This is a mis-translation of the words. The rendering should be as in the Revised Version, "God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi," etc., Lehi (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was waged, possibly so called because it was in shape like a jaw-bone. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Jealousy</b></a>     Suspicion of a wife's purity, one of the strongest passions (<a href="../kjv/num005.htm#014">Num 5:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro006.htm#034">Pro 6:34</a>; <a href="../kjv/sol008.htm#006">Sol 8:6</a>); also an intense interest for another's honour or prosperity (<a href="../kjv/psa079.htm#005">Psa 79:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/co1010.htm#022">Co1 10:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/zac001.htm#014">Zac 1:14</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Jealousy, Image of</b></a>     An idolatrous object, seen in vision by Ezekiel (<a href="../kjv/eze008.htm#003">Eze 8:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5</a>), which stood in the priests' or inner court of the temple. Probably identical with the statue of Astarte (<a href="../kjv/kg2021.htm#007">Kg2 21:7</a>).
