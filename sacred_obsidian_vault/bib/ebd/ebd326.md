 <p><a name="005"><b>Seirath</b></a>     Woody district; shaggy, a place among the mountains of Ephraim, bordering on Benjamin, to which Ehud fled after he had assassinated Eglon at Jericho (<a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#026">Jdg 3:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#027">Jdg 3:27</a>).

It was near Mount Hor, close by the desert of Zin. It is called "the rock" (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#036">Jdg 1:36</a>). When Amaziah took it he called it Joktheel (q.v.)

It appears in later history and in the Vulgate Version under the name of Petra. "The caravans from all ages, from the interior of Arabia and from the Gulf of Persia, from Hadramaut on the ocean, and even from Sabea or Yemen, appear to have pointed to Petra as a common centre; and from Petra the tide seems again to have branched out in every direction, to Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, through Arsinoe, Gaza, Tyre, Jerusalem, and Damascus, and by other routes, terminating at the Mediterranean." (See EDOM [2].)

 <p><a name="007"><b>Sela-hammahlekoth</b></a>     Cliff of divisions the name of the great gorge which lies between Hachilah and Maon, south-east of Hebron. This gorge is now called the Wady Malaky.

 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Seleucia</b></a>     The sea-port of Antioch, near the mouth of the Orontes. Paul and his companions sailed from this port on their first missionary journey (<a href="../kjv/act013.htm#004">Act 13:4</a>). This city was built by Seleucus Nicator, the "king of Syria." It is said of him that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas." Seleucia became a city of great importance, and was made a "free city" by Pompey. It is now a small village, called el-Kalusi.
