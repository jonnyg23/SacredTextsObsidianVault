 <p><a name="000"><b>Uzza</b></a>     Strength, a garden in which Manasseh and Amon were buried (<a href="../kjv/kg2021.htm#018">Kg2 21:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2021.htm#026">Kg2 21:26</a>). It was probably near the king's palace in Jerusalem, or may have formed part of the palace grounds. Manasseh may probably have acquired it from some one of this name. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Uzzah</b></a>     Strength, a son of Abinadab, in whose house the men of Kirjath-jearim placed the ark when it was brought back from the land of the Philistines (<a href="../kjv/sa1007.htm#001">Sa1 7:1</a>). He with his brother Ahio drove the cart on which the ark was placed when David sought to bring it up to Jerusalem. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah, in direct violation of the divine law (<a href="../kjv/num004.htm#015">Num 4:15</a>), put forth his hand to steady the ark, and was immediately smitten unto death. The place where this occurred was henceforth called Perez-uzzah (<a href="../kjv/ch1013.htm#011">Ch1 13:11</a>). David on this feared to proceed further, and placed the ark in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (<a href="../kjv/sa2006.htm#002">Sa2 6:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1013.htm#006">Ch1 13:6</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Uzzen-sherah</b></a>     A town probably near Beth-horon. It derived its name from the daughter of Ephraim (<a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#024">Ch1 7:24</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Uzzi</b></a>     The Lord is my strength.     (1.) The son of Bukki, and a descendant of Aaron (<a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#005">Ch1 6:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#051">Ch1 6:51</a>; <a href="../kjv/ezr007.htm#004">Ezr 7:4</a>). (2.) A grandson of Issachar (<a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#002">Ch1 7:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#003">Ch1 7:3</a>). (3.) A son of Bela, and grandson of Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#007">Ch1 7:7</a>). (4.) A Benjamite, a chief in the tribe (<a href="../kjv/ch1009.htm#008">Ch1 9:8</a>). (5.) A son of Bani. He had the oversight of the Levites after the return from captivity (<a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#022">Neh 11:22</a>). (6.) The head of the house of Jedaiah, one of "the chief of the priests" (<a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#019">Neh 12:19</a>). (7.) A priest who assisted in the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/neh012.htm#042">Neh 12:42</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Uzziah</b></a>     A contracted form of Azariah the Lord is my strength.     (1.) One of Amaziah's sons, whom the people made king of Judah in his father's stead (<a href="../kjv/kg2014.htm#021">Kg2 14:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#001">Ch2 26:1</a>). His long reign of about fifty-two years was "the most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of Solomon." He was a vigorous and able ruler, and "his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt" (<a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#008">Ch2 26:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#014">Ch2 26:14</a>). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord" (<a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#003">Kg2 15:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#004">Ch2 26:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#005">Ch2 26:5</a>); but toward the close of his long life "his heart was lifted up to his destruction," and he wantonly invaded the priest's office (<a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#016">Ch2 26:16</a>), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him (<a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#017">Ch2 26:17</a>), saying, "It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense." Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense (<a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#019">Ch2 26:19</a>), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in "a several house" to the day of his death <a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#005">Kg2 15:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#027">Kg2 15:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#003">Ch2 26:3</a>). He was buried in a separate grave "in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings" (<a href="../kjv/kg2015.htm#007">Kg2 15:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2026.htm#023">Ch2 26:23</a>). "That lonely grave in the royal necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore" (Dr. Green's Kingdom of Israel, etc.). (2.) The father of Jehonathan, one of David's overseers (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#025">Ch1 27:25</a>).

A Simeonite captain (<a href="../kjv/ch1004.htm#039">Ch1 4:39</a>). (3.) A son of Bela, and grandson of Benjamin (<a href="../kjv/ch1007.htm#007">Ch1 7:7</a>). (4.) One of the sons of Heman (<a href="../kjv/ch1025.htm#004">Ch1 25:4</a>); called also Azareel (<a href="../kjv/ch1025.htm#018">Ch1 25:18</a>). (5.) A son of Jeduthan (<a href="../kjv/ch2029.htm#014">Ch2 29:14</a>). (6.) The son of Harhaiah (<a href="../kjv/neh003.htm#008">Neh 3:8</a>).
