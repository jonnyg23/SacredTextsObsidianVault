 <p><a name="000"><b>Chancellor</b></a>     One who has judicial authority, literally, a "lord of judgement;" a title given to the Persian governor of Samaria (<a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#008">Ezr 4:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#009">Ezr 4:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#017">Ezr 4:17</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Changes of Raiment</b></a>     Were reckoned among the treasures of rich men (<a href="../kjv/gen045.htm#022">Gen 45:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg014.htm#012">Jdg 14:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg014.htm#013">Jdg 14:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2005.htm#022">Kg2 5:22</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2005.htm#023">Kg2 5:23</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Channel</b></a>      (1.) The bed of the sea or of a river (<a href="../kjv/psa018.htm#015">Psa 18:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isa 8:7</a>). (2.) The "chanelbone" (<a href="../kjv/job031.htm#022">Job 31:22</a> marg.), properly "tube" or "shaft," an old term for the collar-bone. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Chapel</b></a>     A holy place or sanctuary, occurs only in <a href="../kjv/amo007.htm#013">Amo 7:13</a>, where one of the idol priests calls Bethel "the king's chapel." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Chapiter</b></a>     The ornamental head or capital of a pillar. Three Hebrew words are so rendered.     (1.) Cothereth (<a href="../kjv/kg1007.htm#016">Kg1 7:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2025.htm#017">Kg2 25:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2004.htm#012">Ch2 4:12</a>), meaning a "diadem" or "crown." (2.) Tzepheth (<a href="../kjv/ch2003.htm#015">Ch2 3:15</a>). (3.) Rosh (<a href="../kjv/exo036.htm#038">Exo 36:38</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo038.htm#017">Exo 38:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo038.htm#019">Exo 38:19</a>, <a href="../kjv/exo038.htm#028">Exo 38:28</a>), properly a "head" or "top." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Chapter</b></a>     The several books of the Old and New Testaments were from an early time divided into chapters. The Pentateuch was divided by the ancient Hebrews into 54 parshioth or sections, one of which was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day (<a href="../kjv/act013.htm#015">Act 13:15</a>). These sections were afterwards divided into 669 sidrim or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were divided in somewhat the same manner into haphtaroth or passages. In the early Latin and Greek versions of the Bible, similar divisions of the several books were made. The New Testament books were also divided into portions of various lengths under different names, such as titles and heads or chapters. In modern times this ancient example was imitated, and many attempts of the kind were made before the existing division into chapters was fixed. The Latin Bible published by Cardinal Hugo of St. Cher in A.D. 1240 is generally regarded as the first Bible that was divided into our present chapters, although it appears that some of the chapters were fixed as early as A.D. 1059. This division into chapters came gradually to be adopted in the published editions of the Hebrew, with some few variations, and of the Greek Scriptures, and hence of other versions.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Charashim</b></a>     Craftsmen, a valleynamed in <a href="../kjv/ch1004.htm#014">Ch1 4:14</a>. In <a href="../kjv/neh011.htm#035">Neh 11:35</a> the Hebrew word is rendered "valley of craftsmen" (R.V. marg., Geha-rashim). Nothing is known of it. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Charger</b></a>     A bowl or deep dish. The silver vessels given by the heads of the tribes for the services of the tabernacle are so named (<a href="../kjv/num007.htm#013">Num 7:13</a>, etc.). The "charger" in which the Baptist's head was presented was a platter or flat wooden trencher (<a href="../kjv/mat014.htm#008">Mat 14:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat014.htm#011">Mat 14:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar006.htm#025">Mar 6:25</a>, <a href="../kjv/mar006.htm#028">Mar 6:28</a>). The chargers of gold and silver of <a href="../kjv/ezr001.htm#009">Ezr 1:9</a> were probably basins for receiving the blood of sacrifices. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Chariot</b></a>     A vehicle generally used for warlike purposes. Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for peaceful purposes. The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh's second state chariot (<a href="../kjv/gen041.htm#043">Gen 41:43</a>); and the next, when he went out in his own chariot to meet his father Jacob (<a href="../kjv/gen046.htm#029">Gen 46:29</a>). Chariots formed part of the funeral procession of Jacob (<a href="../kjv/gen050.htm#009">Gen 50:9</a>). When Pharaoh pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots with him (<a href="../kjv/exo014.htm#007">Exo 14:7</a>). The Canaanites in the valleys of Palestine had chariots of iron (<a href="../kjv/jos017.htm#018">Jos 17:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#019">Jdg 1:19</a>). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots (<a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#003">Jdg 4:3</a>); and in Saul's time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils (<a href="../kjv/sa2008.htm#004">Sa2 8:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2010.htm#018">Sa2 10:18</a>). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots (<a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</a>), which were chiefly imported from Egypt (<a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#029">Kg1 10:29</a>). From this time forward they formed part of the armies of Israel (<a href="../kjv/kg1022.htm#034">Kg1 22:34</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#016">Kg2 9:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#021">Kg2 9:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2013.htm#007">Kg2 13:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2013.htm#014">Kg2 13:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2018.htm#024">Kg2 18:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#030">Kg2 23:30</a>). In the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch (<a href="../kjv/act008.htm#028">Act 8:28</a>, <a href="../kjv/act008.htm#029">Act 8:29</a>, <a href="../kjv/act008.htm#038">Act 8:38</a>). This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts (<a href="../kjv/psa068.htm#017">Psa 68:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2006.htm#017">Kg2 6:17</a>). Elijah, by his prayers and his counsel, was "the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." The rapid agency of God in the phenomena of nature is also spoken of under the similitude of a chariot (<a href="../kjv/psa104.htm#003">Psa 104:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa066.htm#015">Isa 66:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/hab003.htm#008">Hab 3:8</a>). Chariot of the cherubim (<a href="../kjv/ch1028.htm#018">Ch1 28:18</a>), the chariot formed by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord rides. Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots in time of peace (<a href="../kjv/ch2001.htm#014">Ch2 1:14</a>). Chariot horses were such as were peculiarly fitted for service in chariots (<a href="../kjv/kg2007.htm#014">Kg2 7:14</a>). Chariots of war are described in <a href="../kjv/exo014.htm#007">Exo 14:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1013.htm#005">Sa1 13:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2008.htm#004">Sa2 8:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1018.htm#004">Ch1 18:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos011.htm#004">Jos 11:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#003">Jdg 4:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#013">Jdg 4:13</a>. They were not used by the Israelites till the time of David. Elijah was translated in a "chariot of fire" (<a href="../kjv/kg2002.htm#011">Kg2 2:11</a>). Compare <a href="../kjv/kg2006.htm#017">Kg2 6:17</a>. This vision would be to Elisha a source of strength and encouragement, for now he could say, "They that be with us are more than they that be with them." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Charity</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/co1013.htm#001">Co1 13:1</a>), the rendering in the Authorized Version of the word which properly denotes love, and is frequently so rendered (always so in the Revised Version). It is spoken of as the greatest of the three Christian graces (1 Cor. 12:31-13:13).
