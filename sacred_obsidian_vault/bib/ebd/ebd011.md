 <p><a name="000"><b>Adummim</b></a>     The red ones, a place apparently on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, "on the south side of the torrent" Wady Kelt, looking toward Gilgal, mentioned <a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#007">Jos 15:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos018.htm#017">Jos 18:17</a>. It was nearly half-way between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now bears the name of Tal-at-ed-Dumm. It is supposed to have been the place referred to in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="../kjv/luk010.htm#030">Luk 10:30</a>). Recently a new carriage-road has been completed, and carriages for the first time have come along this road from Jerusalem.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Adversary</b></a>     (Heb.  satan ), an opponent or foe (<a href="../kjv/kg1005.htm#004">Kg1 5:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#014">Kg1 11:14</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#023">Kg1 11:23</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1011.htm#025">Kg1 11:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk013.htm#017">Luk 13:17</a>); one that speaks against another, a complainant (<a href="../kjv/mat005.htm#025">Mat 5:25</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk012.htm#058">Luk 12:58</a>); an enemy (<a href="../kjv/luk018.htm#003">Luk 18:3</a>), and specially the devil (<a href="../kjv/pe1005.htm#008">Pe1 5:8</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Advocate</b></a>     (Gr.  parakletos ), one who pleads another's cause, who helps another by defending or comforting him. It is a name given by Christ three times to the Holy Ghost (<a href="../kjv/joh014.htm#016">Joh 14:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh015.htm#026">Joh 15:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/joh016.htm#007">Joh 16:7</a>, where the Greek word is rendered "Comforter," q.v.). It is applied to Christ in <a href="../kjv/jo1002.htm#001">Jo1 2:1</a>, where the same Greek word is rendered "Advocate," the rendering which it should have in all the places where it occurs. Tertullus "the orator" (<a href="../kjv/act024.htm#001">Act 24:1</a>) was a Roman advocate whom the Jews employed to accuse Paul before Felix. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Aenon</b></a>     Springs, a place near Salim where John baptized (<a href="../kjv/joh003.htm#023">Joh 3:23</a>). It was probably near the upper source of the Wady  Far'ah , an open valley extending from Mount Ebal to the Jordan. It is full of springs. A place has been found called  'Ainun , four miles north of the springs. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Affection</b></a>     Feeling or emotion. Mention is made of "vile affections" (<a href="../kjv/rom001.htm#026">Rom 1:26</a>) and "inordinate affection" (<a href="../kjv/col003.htm#005">Col 3:5</a>). Christians are exhorted to set their affections on things above (<a href="../kjv/col003.htm#002">Col 3:2</a>). There is a distinction between natural and spiritual or gracious affections (<a href="../kjv/eze033.htm#032">Eze 33:32</a>).

Marriages are prohibited within certain degrees of affinity, enumerated <a href="../kjv/lev018.htm#006">Lev 18:6</a>. Consanguinity is relationship by blood.

They are all directed by God (<a href="../kjv/lam003.htm#033">Lam 3:33</a>), and will result in the everlasting good of his people (<a href="../kjv/co2004.htm#016">Co2 4:16</a>) in Christ Jesus (<a href="../kjv/rom008.htm#035">Rom 8:35</a>).

Many years afterwards he met Paul at Caesarea, and warned him of the bonds and affliction that awaited him at Jerusalem should he persist in going thither (<a href="../kjv/act021.htm#010">Act 21:10</a>). 
 </p>

A king of the Amalekites referred to by Balaam (<a href="../kjv/num024.htm#007">Num 24:7</a>). He lived at the time of the Exodus. (2.) Another king of the Amalekites whom Saul spared unlawfully, but whom Samuel on his arrival in the camp of Saul ordered, in retributive justice (Judg. 1), to be brought out and cut in pieces (1 Sam. 15:8-33. Compare <a href="../kjv/exo017.htm#011">Exo 17:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/num014.htm#045">Num 14:45</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Agagite</b></a>     A name applied to Haman and also to his father (<a href="../kjv/est003.htm#001">Est 3:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/est003.htm#010">Est 3:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/est008.htm#003">Est 8:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/est008.htm#005">Est 8:5</a>). Probably it was equivalent to Amalekite.
