 <p><a name="000"><b>Straw</b></a>     Used in brick-making (<a href="../kjv/exo005.htm#007">Exo 5:7</a>). Used figuratively in <a href="../kjv/job041.htm#027">Job 41:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa011.htm#007">Isa 11:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa025.htm#010">Isa 25:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa065.htm#025">Isa 65:25</a>.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Stealing</b></a>     See THEFT. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Stoning</b></a>     A form of punishment (<a href="../kjv/lev020.htm#002">Lev 20:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev024.htm#014">Lev 24:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu013.htm#010">Deu 13:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu017.htm#005">Deu 17:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu022.htm#021">Deu 22:21</a>) prescribed for certain offenses. Of Achan (<a href="../kjv/jos007.htm#025">Jos 7:25</a>), Naboth (1 Kings 21), Stephen (<a href="../kjv/act007.htm#059">Act 7:59</a>), Paul (<a href="../kjv/act014.htm#019">Act 14:19</a>; <a href="../kjv/co2011.htm#025">Co2 11:25</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Stream of Egypt</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/isa027.htm#012">Isa 27:12</a>), the Wady  el-'Arish , called also "the river of Egypt," R.V., "brook of Egypt" (<a href="../kjv/num034.htm#005">Num 34:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#004">Jos 15:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</a>). It is the natural boundary of Egypt. Occasionally in winter, when heavy rains have fallen among the mountains inland, it becomes a turbulent rushing torrent. The present boundary between Egypt and Palestine is about midway between  el-'Arish  and Gaza. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Street</b></a>     The street called "Straight" at Damascus (<a href="../kjv/act009.htm#011">Act 9:11</a>) is "a long broad street, running from east to west, about a mile in length, and forming the principal thoroughfare in the city." In Oriental towns streets are usually narrow and irregular and filthy (<a href="../kjv/psa018.htm#042">Psa 18:42</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa010.htm#006">Isa 10:6</a>). "It is remarkable," says Porter, "that all the important cities of Palestine and Syria Samaria, Caesarea, Gerasa, Bozrah, Damascus, Palmyra, had their 'straight streets' running through the centre of the city, and lined with stately rows of columns. The most perfect now remaining are those of Palmyra and Gerasa, where long ranges of the columns still stand." Through Samaria, etc. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Stripes</b></a>     As a punishment were not to exceed forty (<a href="../kjv/deu025.htm#001">Deu 25:1</a>), and hence arose the custom of limiting them to thirty-nine (<a href="../kjv/co2011.htm#024">Co2 11:24</a>). Paul claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen in regard to the infliction of stripes (<a href="../kjv/act016.htm#037">Act 16:37</a>, <a href="../kjv/act016.htm#038">Act 16:38</a>; <a href="../kjv/act022.htm#025">Act 22:25</a>). Our Lord was beaten with stripes (<a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#026">Mat 27:26</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Subscriptions</b></a>     The subscriptions to Paul's epistles are no part of the original. In their present form they are ascribed to Euthalius, a bishop of the fifth century. Some of them are obviously incorrect. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Suburbs</b></a>     The immediate vicinity of a city or town (<a href="../kjv/num035.htm#003">Num 35:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/num035.htm#007">Num 35:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze045.htm#002">Eze 45:2</a>). In <a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#011">Kg2 23:11</a> the Hebrew word there used (parvarim) occurs nowhere else. The Revised Version renders it "precincts." The singular form of this Hebrew word (parvar) is supposed by some to be the same as Parbar (q.v.), which occurs twice in <a href="../kjv/ch1026.htm#018">Ch1 26:18</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Succoth</b></a>     Booths.     (1.) The first encampment of the Israelites after leaving Ramesses (<a href="../kjv/exo012.htm#037">Exo 12:37</a>); the civil name of Pithom (q.v.). (2.) A city on the east of Jordan, identified with Tell  Dar'ala , a high mound, a mass of debris, in the plain north of Jabbok and about one mile from it (<a href="../kjv/jos013.htm#027">Jos 13:27</a>). Here Jacob (<a href="../kjv/gen032.htm#017">Gen 32:17</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen032.htm#030">Gen 32:30</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen033.htm#017">Gen 33:17</a>), on his return from Padan-aram after his interview with Esau, built a house for himself and made booths for his cattle. The princes of this city churlishly refused to afford help to Gideon and his 300 men when "faint yet pursuing" they followed one of the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great victory at Gilboa. After overtaking and routing this band at Karkor, Gideon on his return visited the rulers of the city with severe punishment. "He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth" (<a href="../kjv/jdg008.htm#013">Jdg 8:13</a>). At this place were erected the foundries for casting the metal-work for the temple (<a href="../kjv/kg1007.htm#046">Kg1 7:46</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Succoth-benoth</b></a>     Tents of daughters, supposed to be the name of a Babylonian deity, the goddess Zir-banit, the wife of Merodach, worshipped by the colonists in Samaria (<a href="../kjv/kg2017.htm#030">Kg2 17:30</a>).
