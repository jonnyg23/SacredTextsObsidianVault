 <p><a name="000"><b>Yoke-fellow</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/phi004.htm#003">Phi 4:3</a>), one of the apostle's fellow-labourers. Some have conjectured that Epaphroditus is meant. Wyckliffe renders the phrase "the german fellow", i.e., "thee, germane [= genuine] comrade." 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Zaanaim</b></a>     Wanderings; the unloading of tents, so called probably from the fact of nomads in tents encamping amid the cities and villages of that region, a place in the north-west of Lake Merom, near Kedesh, in Naphtali. Here Sisera was slain by Jael, "the wife of Heber the Kenite," who had pitched his tent in the "plain [R.V., 'as far as the oak'] of Zaanaim" (<a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</a>). It has been, however, suggested by some that, following the LXX. and the Talmud, the letter b, which in Hebrew means "in," should be taken as a part of the word following, and the phrase would then be "unto the oak of Bitzanaim," a place which has been identified with the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor.
