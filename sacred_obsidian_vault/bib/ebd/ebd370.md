 <p><a name="000"><b>Toll</b></a>     One of the branches of the king of Persia's revenues (<a href="../kjv/ezr004.htm#013">Ezr 4:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/ezr007.htm#024">Ezr 7:24</a>), probably a tax levied from those who used the bridges and fords and highways.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Tombs</b></a>     Of the Hebrews were generally excavated in the solid rock, or were natural caves. Mention is made of such tombs in <a href="../kjv/jdg008.htm#032">Jdg 8:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2002.htm#032">Sa2 2:32</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#028">Kg2 9:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#030">Kg2 23:30</a>. They were sometimes made in gardens (<a href="../kjv/kg2021.htm#026">Kg2 21:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2023.htm#016">Kg2 23:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#060">Mat 27:60</a>). They are found in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the land. They were sometimes whitewashed (<a href="../kjv/mat023.htm#027">Mat 23:27</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat023.htm#029">Mat 23:29</a>). The body of Jesus was laid in Joseph's new rock-hewn tomb, in a garden near to Calvary. All evidence is in favour of the opinion that this tomb was somewhere near the Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be identified with the so-called "holy sepulchre." The mouth of such rocky tombs was usually closed by a large stone (Heb.  golal ), which could only be removed by the united efforts of several men (<a href="../kjv/mat028.htm#002">Mat 28:2</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/joh011.htm#039">Joh 11:39</a>). (See GOLGOTHA.)

 <p><a name="002"><b>Tongues, Confusion of</b></a>     At Babel, the cause of the early separation of mankind and their division into nations. The descendants of Noah built a tower to prevent their dispersion; but God "confounded their language" (<a href="../kjv/gen011.htm#001">Gen 11:1</a>), and they were scattered over the whole earth. Till this time "the whole earth was of one language and of one speech." (See SHINAR.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Tongues, Gift of</b></a>     Granted on the day of Pentecost (<a href="../kjv/act002.htm#004">Act 2:4</a>), in fulfillment of a promise Christ had made to his disciples (<a href="../kjv/mar016.htm#017">Mar 16:17</a>). What this gift actually was has been a subject of much discussion. Some have argued that it was merely an outward sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit among the disciples, typifying his manifold gifts, and showing that salvation was to be extended to all nations. But the words of Luke (<a href="../kjv/act002.htm#009">Act 2:9</a>) clearly show that the various peoples in Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost did really hear themselves addressed in their own special language with which they were naturally acquainted (compare <a href="../kjv/joe002.htm#028">Joe 2:28</a>, <a href="../kjv/joe002.htm#029">Joe 2:29</a>). Among the gifts of the Spirit the apostle enumerates in 1 Cor. 12:10 - 14:30, "divers kinds of tongues" and the "interpretation of tongues." This "gift" was a different manifestation of the Spirit from that on Pentecost, although it resembled it in many particulars. Tongues were to be "a sign to them that believe not."

 <p><a name="004"><b>Tooth</b></a>     One of the particulars regarding which retaliatory punishment was to be inflicted (<a href="../kjv/exo021.htm#024">Exo 21:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev024.htm#020">Lev 24:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu019.htm#021">Deu 19:21</a>). "Gnashing of teeth" = rage, despair (<a href="../kjv/mat008.htm#012">Mat 8:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/act007.htm#054">Act 7:54</a>); "cleanness of teeth" = famine (<a href="../kjv/amo004.htm#006">Amo 4:6</a>); "children's teeth set on edge" = children suffering for the sins of their fathers (<a href="../kjv/eze018.htm#002">Eze 18:2</a>).

 <p><a name="005"><b>Topaz</b></a>     Heb.  pitdah  (<a href="../kjv/eze028.htm#013">Eze 28:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev021.htm#020">Rev 21:20</a>), a golden yellow or "green" stone brought from Cush or Ethiopia (<a href="../kjv/job028.htm#019">Job 28:19</a>). It was the second stone in the first row in the breastplate of the high priest, and had the name of Simeon inscribed on it (<a href="../kjv/exo028.htm#017">Exo 28:17</a>). It is probably the chrysolite of the moderns. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Tophel</b></a>     Lime, a place in the wilderness of Sinai (<a href="../kjv/deu001.htm#001">Deu 1:1</a>), now identified with Tafyleh or Tufileh, on the west side of the Edomitish mountains. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Tophet</b></a>     =Topheth, from Heb.  toph  "a drum," because the cries of children here sacrificed by the priests of Moloch were drowned by the noise of such an instrument; or from taph or toph, meaning "to burn," and hence a place of burning, the name of a particular part in the valley of Hinnom. "Fire being the most destructive of all elements, is chosen by the sacred writers to symbolize the agency by which God punishes or destroys the wicked. We are not to assume from prophetical figures that material fire is the precise agent to be used. It was not the agency employed in the destruction of Sennacherib, mentioned in <a href="../kjv/isa030.htm#033">Isa 30:33</a> Tophet properly begins where the Vale of Hinnom bends round to the east, having the cliffs of Zion on the north, and the Hill of Evil Counsel on the south. It terminates at  Beer 'Ayub , where it joins the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The cliffs on the southern side especially abound in ancient tombs. Here the dead carcasses of beasts and every offal and abomination were cast, and left to be either devoured by that worm that never died or consumed by that fire that was never quenched." Thus Tophet came to represent the place of punishment. (See HINNOM.)

 <p><a name="008"><b>Torches</b></a>     On the night of his betrayal, when our Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas, "having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons" (<a href="../kjv/joh018.htm#001">Joh 18:1</a>). Although it was the time of full moon, yet in the valley of the Kidron "there fell great, deep shadows from the declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were there caverns and grottos, into which a fugitive might retreat; finally, there were probably a garden-house and tower, into whose gloom it might be necessary for a searcher to throw light around." Lange's Commentary. (<a href="../kjv/nah002.htm#003">Nah 2:3</a>, "torches," Revised Version, "steel," probably should be "scythes" for war-chariots.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Torment</b></a>     Gr.  basanos  (<a href="../kjv/mat004.htm#024">Mat 4:24</a>), the "touch-stone" of justice; hence inquisition by torture, and then any disease which racks and tortures the limbs.
