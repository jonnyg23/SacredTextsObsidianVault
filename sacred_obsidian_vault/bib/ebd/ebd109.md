 <p><a name="000"><b>Dulcimer</b></a>     (Heb.  sumphoniah ), a musical instrument mentioned in <a href="../kjv/dan003.htm#005">Dan 3:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/dan003.htm#015">Dan 3:15</a>, along with other instruments there named, as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the "bag-pipe." Luther translated it "lute," and Grotius the "crooked trumpet." It is probable that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by "organ," the well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by "lyre." The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to the zampagna of Southern Europe.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Dumah</b></a>     Silence, (compare <a href="../kjv/psa094.htm#017">Psa 94:17</a>), the fourth son of Ishmael; also the tribe descended from him; and hence also the region in Arabia which they inhabited (<a href="../kjv/gen025.htm#014">Gen 25:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#030">Ch1 1:30</a>). There was also a town of this name in Judah (<a href="../kjv/jos015.htm#052">Jos 15:52</a>), which has been identified with ed-Domeh, about 10 miles southwest of Hebron. The place mentioned in the "burden" of the prophet Isaiah (<a href="../kjv/isa021.htm#011">Isa 21:11</a>) is Edom or Idumea. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Dumb</b></a>     From natural infirmity (<a href="../kjv/exo004.htm#011">Exo 4:11</a>); not knowing what to say (<a href="../kjv/pro031.htm#008">Pro 31:8</a>); unwillingness to speak (<a href="../kjv/psa039.htm#009">Psa 39:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev010.htm#003">Lev 10:3</a>). Christ repeatedly restored the dumb (<a href="../kjv/mat009.htm#032">Mat 9:32</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat009.htm#033">Mat 9:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk011.htm#014">Luk 11:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat012.htm#022">Mat 12:22</a>) to the use of speech. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Dung</b></a>      (1.) Used as manure (<a href="../kjv/luk013.htm#008">Luk 13:8</a>); collected outside the city walls (<a href="../kjv/neh002.htm#013">Neh 2:13</a>). Of sacrifices, burned outside the camp (<a href="../kjv/exo029.htm#014">Exo 29:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev004.htm#011">Lev 4:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/lev008.htm#017">Lev 8:17</a>; <a href="../kjv/num019.htm#005">Num 19:5</a>). To be "cast out as dung," a figurative expression (<a href="../kjv/kg1014.htm#010">Kg1 14:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg2009.htm#037">Kg2 9:37</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer008.htm#002">Jer 8:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa018.htm#042">Psa 18:42</a>), meaning to be rejected as unprofitable. (2.) Used as fuel, a substitute for firewood, which was with difficulty procured in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt (<a href="../kjv/eze004.htm#012">Eze 4:12</a>), where cows' and camels' dung is used to the present day for this purpose. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Dung-gate</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/neh002.htm#013">Neh 2:13</a>), a gate of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. "The gate outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and off-scourings of the streets," in the valley of Tophet. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Dung-hill</b></a>     To sit on a, was a sign of the deepest dejection (<a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#008">Sa1 2:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa113.htm#007">Psa 113:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/lam004.htm#005">Lam 4:5</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Dungeon</b></a>     Different from the ordinary prison in being more severe as a place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison (<a href="../kjv/act016.htm#024">Act 16:24</a>), it consisted of a deep cell or cistern (<a href="../kjv/jer038.htm#006">Jer 38:6</a>). To be shut up in, a punishment common in Egypt (<a href="../kjv/gen039.htm#020">Gen 39:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen040.htm#003">Gen 40:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen041.htm#010">Gen 41:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen042.htm#019">Gen 42:19</a>). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was frequently used as a punishment (<a href="../kjv/ch2016.htm#010">Ch2 16:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer020.htm#002">Jer 20:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer032.htm#002">Jer 32:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer033.htm#001">Jer 33:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/jer037.htm#015">Jer 37:15</a>), and it was customary after the Exile (<a href="../kjv/mat011.htm#002">Mat 11:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk003.htm#020">Luk 3:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/act005.htm#018">Act 5:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/act005.htm#021">Act 5:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/mat018.htm#030">Mat 18:30</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Dura</b></a>     The circle, the plain near Babylon in which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image, mentioned in <a href="../kjv/dan003.htm#001">Dan 3:1</a>. The place still retains its ancient name. On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must have been a colossal statue has been found. It has been supposed to be that of the golden image. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Dust</b></a>     Storms of sand and dust sometimes overtake Eastern travelers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking him, a rain of "powder and dust" (<a href="../kjv/deu028.htm#024">Deu 28:24</a>). To cast dust on the head was a sign of mourning (<a href="../kjv/jos007.htm#006">Jos 7:6</a>); and to sit in dust, of extreme affliction (<a href="../kjv/isa047.htm#001">Isa 47:1</a>). "Dust" is used to denote the grave (<a href="../kjv/job007.htm#021">Job 7:21</a>). "To shake off the dust from one's feet" against another is to renounce all future intercourse with him (<a href="../kjv/mat010.htm#014">Mat 10:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/act013.htm#051">Act 13:51</a>). To "lick the dust" is a sign of abject submission (<a href="../kjv/psa072.htm#009">Psa 72:9</a>); and to throw dust at one is a sign of abhorrence (<a href="../kjv/sa2016.htm#013">Sa2 16:13</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/act022.htm#023">Act 22:23</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Dwarf</b></a>     A lean or emaciated person (<a href="../kjv/lev021.htm#020">Lev 21:20</a>).
