 <p><a name="000"><b>Harosheth of the Gentiles</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/jdg004.htm#002">Jdg 4:2</a>) or nations, a city near Hazor in Galilee of the Gentiles, or Upper Galilee, in the north of Palestine. It was here that Jabin's great army was marshaled before it went forth into the great battlefield of Esdraelon to encounter the army of Israel, by which it was routed and put to flight (Judg. 4). It was situated "at the entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of Acre" at the base of Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is Harosheth ha Gojim, i.e., " the smithy of the nations;" probably, as is supposed, so called because here Jabin's iron war-chariots, armed with scythes, were made. It is identified with el-Harithiyeh.

 <p><a name="001"><b>Harp</b></a>     (Heb.  kinnor ), the national instrument of the Hebrews. It was invented by Jubal (<a href="../kjv/gen004.htm#021">Gen 4:21</a>). Some think the word kinnor denotes the whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God (<a href="../kjv/gen031.htm#027">Gen 31:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#023">Sa1 16:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch2020.htm#028">Ch2 20:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa033.htm#002">Psa 33:2</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa137.htm#002">Psa 137:2</a>). In Solomon's time harps were made of almug-trees (<a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#011">Kg1 10:11</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1010.htm#012">Kg1 10:12</a>). In <a href="../kjv/ch1015.htm#021">Ch1 15:21</a> mention is made of "harps on the Sheminith;" Revised Version, "harps set to the Sheminith;" better perhaps "harps of eight strings." The soothing effect of the music of the harp is referred to <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#016">Sa1 16:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1016.htm#023">Sa1 16:23</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1018.htm#010">Sa1 18:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1019.htm#009">Sa1 19:9</a>. The church in heaven is represented as celebrating the triumphs of the Redeemer "harping with their harps" (<a href="../kjv/rev014.htm#002">Rev 14:2</a>).
