 <p><a name="000"><b>Hurai</b></a>     Linen-worker, one of David's heroes, a native of the valley of Mount Gaash (<a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#032">Ch1 11:32</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Husband</b></a>     I.e., the "house-band," connecting and keeping together the whole family. A man when betrothed was esteemed from that time a husband (<a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#016">Mat 1:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat001.htm#020">Mat 1:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk002.htm#005">Luk 2:5</a>). A recently married man was exempt from going to war for "one year" (<a href="../kjv/deu020.htm#007">Deu 20:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu024.htm#005">Deu 24:5</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Husbandman</b></a>     One whose business it is to cultivate the ground. It was one of the first occupations, and was esteemed most honourable (<a href="../kjv/gen009.htm#020">Gen 9:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen026.htm#012">Gen 26:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen026.htm#014">Gen 26:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen037.htm#007">Gen 37:7</a>, etc.). All the Hebrews, except those engaged in religious services, were husbandman. (See AGRICULTURE.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Hushai</b></a>     Quick, "the Archite," "the king's friend" (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#033">Ch1 27:33</a>). When David fled from Jerusalem, on account of the rebellion of Absalom, and had reached the summit of Olivet, he there met Hushai, whom he sent back to Jerusalem for the purpose of counteracting the influence of Ahithophel, who had joined the ranks of Absalom (<a href="../kjv/sa2015.htm#032">Sa2 15:32</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa2015.htm#037">Sa2 15:37</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2016.htm#016">Sa2 16:16</a>). It was by his advice that Absalom refrained from immediately pursuing after David. By this delay the cause of Absalom was ruined, for it gave David time to muster his forces. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Husk</b></a>     In <a href="../kjv/num006.htm#004">Num 6:4</a> (Heb.  zag ) it means the "skin" of a grape. In <a href="../kjv/kg2004.htm#042">Kg2 4:42</a> (Heb.  tsiqlon ) it means a "sack" for grain, as rendered in the Revised Version. In <a href="../kjv/luk015.htm#016">Luk 15:16</a>, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, it designates the beans of the carob tree, or Ceratonia siliqua. From the supposition, mistaken, however, that it was on the husks of this tree that John the Baptist fed, it is called "St. John's bread" and "locust tree." This tree is in "February covered with innumerable purple-red pendent blossoms, which ripen in April and May into large crops of pods from 6 to 10 inches long, flat, brown, narrow, and bent like a horn (whence the Greek name  keratia , meaning 'little horns'), with a sweetish taste when still unripe. Enormous quantities of these are gathered for sale in various towns and for exportation." "They were eaten as food, though only by the poorest of the poor, in the time of our Lord." The bean is called a "gerah," which is used as the name of the smallest Hebrew weight, twenty of these making a shekel.

 <p><a name="005"><b>Hymn</b></a>     Occurs only <a href="../kjv/eph005.htm#019">Eph 5:19</a> and <a href="../kjv/col003.htm#016">Col 3:16</a>. The verb to "sing an hymn" occurs <a href="../kjv/mat026.htm#030">Mat 26:30</a> and <a href="../kjv/mar014.htm#026">Mar 14:26</a>. The same Greek word is rendered to "sing praises" <a href="../kjv/act016.htm#025">Act 16:25</a> (R.V., "sing hymns") and <a href="../kjv/heb002.htm#012">Heb 2:12</a>. The "hymn" which our Lord sang with his disciples at the last Supper is generally supposed to have been the latter part of the Hallel, comprehending Ps. 113-118. It was thus a name given to a number of psalms taken together and forming a devotional exercise. The noun hymn is used only with reference to the services of the Greeks, and was distinguished from the psalm. The Greek tunes required Greek hymns. Our information regarding the hymnology of the early Christians is very limited.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Hypocrite</b></a>     One who puts on a mask and feigns himself to be what he is not; a dissembler in religion. Our Lord severely rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy (<a href="../kjv/mat006.htm#002">Mat 6:2</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat006.htm#005">Mat 6:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat006.htm#016">Mat 6:16</a>). "The hypocrite's hope shall perish" (<a href="../kjv/job008.htm#013">Job 8:13</a>). The Hebrew word here rendered "hypocrite" rather means the "godless" or "profane," as it is rendered in <a href="../kjv/jer023.htm#011">Jer 23:11</a>, i.e., polluted with crimes. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Hyssop</b></a>     (Heb.  'ezob ; LXX. hyssopos), first mentioned in <a href="../kjv/exo012.htm#022">Exo 12:22</a> in connection with the institution of the Passover. We find it afterwards mentioned in <a href="../kjv/lev014.htm#004">Lev 14:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev014.htm#006">Lev 14:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/lev014.htm#052">Lev 14:52</a>; <a href="../kjv/num019.htm#006">Num 19:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/num019.htm#018">Num 19:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb009.htm#019">Heb 9:19</a>. It is spoken of as a plant "springing out of the wall" (<a href="../kjv/kg1004.htm#033">Kg1 4:33</a>). Many conjectures have been formed as to what this plant really was. Some contend that it was a species of marjoram (origanum), six species of which are found in Palestine. Others with more probability think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai, and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three or four feet in length (<a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#048">Mat 27:48</a>; <a href="../kjv/mar015.htm#036">Mar 15:36</a>. Compare <a href="../kjv/joh019.htm#029">Joh 19:29</a>).

 <p><a name="008"><b>Ibhar</b></a>     Chosen, one of David's sons (<a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#006">Ch1 3:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa2005.htm#015">Sa2 5:15</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Ibleam</b></a>     People-waster, a city assigned to Manasseh (<a href="../kjv/jos017.htm#011">Jos 17:11</a>), from which the Israelites, however, could not expel the Canaanites (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#027">Jdg 1:27</a>). It is also called Bileam (<a href="../kjv/ch1006.htm#070">Ch1 6:70</a>). It was probably the modern Jelamah, a village 21/2 miles north of Jenin.
