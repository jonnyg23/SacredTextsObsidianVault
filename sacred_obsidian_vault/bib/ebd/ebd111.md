 <p><a name="000"><b>East</b></a>      (1.) The orient (mizrah); the rising of the sun. Thus "the east country" is the country lying to the east of Syria, the Elymais (<a href="../kjv/zac008.htm#007">Zac 8:7</a>). (2.) Properly what is in front of one, or a country that is before or in front of another; the rendering of the word kedem. In pointing out the quarters, a Hebrew always looked with his face toward the east. The word kedem is used when the four quarters of the world are described (<a href="../kjv/gen013.htm#014">Gen 13:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen028.htm#014">Gen 28:14</a>); and mizrah when the east only is distinguished from the west (<a href="../kjv/jos011.htm#003">Jos 11:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa050.htm#001">Psa 50:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa103.htm#012">Psa 103:12</a>, etc.). In <a href="../kjv/gen025.htm#006">Gen 25:6</a> "eastward" is literally "unto the land of kedem;" i.e., the lands lying east of Palestine, namely, Arabia, Mesopotamia, etc.

 <p><a name="001"><b>East gate</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/jer019.htm#002">Jer 19:2</a>), properly the Potter's gate, the gate which led to the potter's field, in the valley of Hinnom. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>East, Children of the</b></a>     The Arabs as a whole, known as the Nabateans or Kedarenes, nomad tribes (<a href="../kjv/jdg006.htm#003">Jdg 6:3</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg006.htm#033">Jdg 6:33</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg007.htm#012">Jdg 7:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/jdg008.htm#010">Jdg 8:10</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>East sea</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/joe002.htm#020">Joe 2:20</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze047.htm#018">Eze 47:18</a>), the Dead Sea, which lay on the east side of the Holy Land. The Mediterranean, which lay on the west, was hence called the "great sea for the west border" (<a href="../kjv/num034.htm#006">Num 34:6</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>East wind</b></a>     The wind coming from the east (<a href="../kjv/job027.htm#021">Job 27:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa027.htm#008">Isa 27:8</a>, etc.). Blight caused by this wind, "thin ears" (<a href="../kjv/gen041.htm#006">Gen 41:6</a>); the withered "gourd" (<a href="../kjv/jon004.htm#008">Jon 4:8</a>). It was the cause and also the emblem of evil (<a href="../kjv/eze017.htm#010">Eze 17:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze019.htm#012">Eze 19:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/hos013.htm#015">Hos 13:15</a>). In Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence is destitute of moisture necessary for vegetation. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Easter</b></a>     Originally a Saxon word (Eostre), denoting a goddess of the Saxons, in honour of whom sacrifices were offered about the time of the Passover. Hence the name came to be given to the festival of the Resurrection of Christ, which occurred at the time of the Passover. In the early English versions this word was frequently used as the translation of the Greek  pascha  (the Passover). When the Authorized Version (1611) was formed, the word "passover" was used in all passages in which this word pascha occurred, except in Act <a href="../kjv/gen012.htm#004">Gen 12:4</a>. In the Revised Version the proper word, "passover," is always used.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Eating</b></a>     The ancient Hebrews would not eat with the Egyptians (<a href="../kjv/gen043.htm#032">Gen 43:32</a>). In the time of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans (<a href="../kjv/joh004.htm#009">Joh 4:9</a>), and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners (<a href="../kjv/mat009.htm#011">Mat 9:11</a>). The Hebrews originally sat at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean practice of reclining (<a href="../kjv/luk007.htm#036">Luk 7:36</a>). Their principal meal was at noon (<a href="../kjv/gen043.htm#016">Gen 43:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1020.htm#016">Kg1 20:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/rut002.htm#014">Rut 2:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/luk014.htm#012">Luk 14:12</a>). The word "eat" is used metaphorically in <a href="../kjv/jer015.htm#016">Jer 15:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze003.htm#001">Eze 3:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/rev010.htm#009">Rev 10:9</a>. In <a href="../kjv/joh006.htm#053">Joh 6:53</a>, "eating and drinking" means believing in Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.).

 <p><a name="007"><b>Ebal</b></a>     Stony.     (1.) A mountain 3,076 feet above the level of the sea, and 1,200 feet above the level of the valley, on the north side of which stood the city of Shechem (q.v.). On this mountain six of the tribes (<a href="../kjv/deu027.htm#012">Deu 27:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/deu027.htm#013">Deu 27:13</a>) were appointed to take their stand and respond according to a prescribed form to the imprecations uttered in the valley, where the law was read by the Levites (<a href="../kjv/deu011.htm#029">Deu 11:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu029.htm#004">Deu 29:4</a>, <a href="../kjv/deu029.htm#013">Deu 29:13</a>). This mountain was also the site of the first great altar erected to Jehovah (<a href="../kjv/deu027.htm#005">Deu 27:5</a>; <a href="../kjv/jos008.htm#030">Jos 8:30</a>). After this the name of Ebal does not again occur in Jewish history. (See GERIZIM.) (2.) A descendant of Eber (<a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#022">Ch1 1:22</a>), called also Obal (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#028">Gen 10:28</a>). (3.) A descendant of Seir the Horite (<a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#023">Gen 36:23</a>).

 <p><a name="008"><b>Ebed</b></a>     Slave, the father of Gaal, in whom the men of Shechem "put confidence" in their conspiracy against Abimelech (<a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#026">Jdg 9:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#026">Jdg 9:26</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#030">Jdg 9:30</a>, <a href="../kjv/jdg009.htm#031">Jdg 9:31</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Ebed-melech</b></a>     A servant of the king; probably an official title, an Ethiopian, "one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house;" i.e., in the palace of Zedekiah, king of Judah. He interceded with the king in Jeremiah's behalf, and was the means of saving him from death by famine (<a href="../kjv/jer038.htm#007">Jer 38:7</a>; compare <a href="../kjv/jer039.htm#015">Jer 39:15</a>).
