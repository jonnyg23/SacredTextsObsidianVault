 <p><a name="000"><b>Hadlai</b></a>     Resting, an Ephraimite; the father of Amasa, mentioned in <a href="../kjv/ch2028.htm#012">Ch2 28:12</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Hadoram</b></a>     Is exalted.     (1.) The son of Tou, king of Hamath, sent by his father to congratulate David on his victory over Hadarezer, king of Syria (<a href="../kjv/ch1018.htm#010">Ch1 18:10</a>; called Joram <a href="../kjv/sa2008.htm#010">Sa2 8:10</a>). (2.) The fifth son of Joktan, the founder of an Arab tribe (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#027">Gen 10:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#021">Ch1 1:21</a>). (3.) One who was "over the tribute;" i.e., "over the levy." He was stoned by the Israelites after they had revolted from Rehoboam (<a href="../kjv/ch2010.htm#018">Ch2 10:18</a>). Called also Adoram (<a href="../kjv/sa2020.htm#024">Sa2 20:24</a>) and Adoniram (<a href="../kjv/kg1004.htm#006">Kg1 4:6</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="002"><b>Hadrach</b></a>     The name of a country (<a href="../kjv/zac009.htm#001">Zac 9:1</a>) which cannot be identified. Rawlinson would identify it with Edessa. He mentions that in the Assyrian inscriptions it is recorded that "Shalmanezer III. made two expeditions, the first against Damascus 773 B.C., and the second against Hadrach 772 B.C.; and again that Asshurdanin-il II. made expeditions against Hadrach in 765 B.C. and 755 B.C.."

 <p><a name="003"><b>Haemorrhoids</b></a>     Or Emerods, bleeding piles known to the ancient Romans as mariscce, but more probably malignant boils of an infectious and fatal character. With this loathsome and infectious disease the men of Ashdod were smitten by the hand of the Lord. This calamity they attributed to the presence of the ark in their midst, and therefore they removed it to Gath (<a href="../kjv/sa1005.htm#006">Sa1 5:6</a>). But the same consequences followed from its presence in Gath, and therefore they had it removed to Ekron, 11 miles distant. The Ekronites were afflicted with the same dreadful malady, but more severely; and a panic seizing the people, they demanded that the ark should be sent back to the land of Israel (<a href="../kjv/sa1005.htm#009">Sa1 5:9</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1006.htm#001">Sa1 6:1</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Haft</b></a>     A handle as of a dagger (<a href="../kjv/jdg003.htm#022">Jdg 3:22</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Hagar</b></a>     Flight, or, according to others, stranger, an Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid (<a href="../kjv/gen016.htm#001">Gen 16:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#009">Gen 21:9</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#010">Gen 21:10</a>), whom she gave to Abraham (q.v.) as a secondary wife (<a href="../kjv/gen016.htm#002">Gen 16:2</a>). When she was about to become a mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the desert of Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had reached the place she distinguished by the name of Beer-lahai-roi ("the well of the visible God"), where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she remained (Gen. 16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael's conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham (<a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#014">Gen 21:14</a>). They wandered out into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst, seemed about to die. Hagar "lifted up her voice and wept," and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared unto her, and she was comforted and delivered out of her distresses (<a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#018">Gen 21:18</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#019">Gen 21:19</a>). Ishmael afterwards established himself in the wilderness of Paran, where he married an Egyptian (<a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#020">Gen 21:20</a>, <a href="../kjv/gen021.htm#021">Gen 21:21</a>). "Hagar" allegorically represents the Jewish church (<a href="../kjv/gal004.htm#024">Gal 4:24</a>), in bondage to the ceremonial law; while "Sarah" represents the Christian church, which is free.

 <p><a name="006"><b>Hagarene</b></a>     Or Hagarite,     (1.) One of David's mighty men (<a href="../kjv/ch1011.htm#038">Ch1 11:38</a>), the son of a foreigner. (2.) Used of Jaziz (<a href="../kjv/ch1027.htm#031">Ch1 27:31</a>), who was over David's flocks. "A Hagarite had charge of David's flocks, and an Ishmaelite of his herds, because the animals were pastured in districts where these nomadic people were accustomed to feed their cattle." (3.) In the reign of Saul a great war was waged between the trans-Jordanic tribes and the Hagarites (1 Chr. 5), who were overcome in battle. A great booty was captured by the two tribes and a half, and they took possession of the land of the Hagarites.    Subsequently the "Hagarenes," still residing in the land on the east of Jordan, entered into a conspiracy against Israel (compare <a href="../kjv/psa083.htm#006">Psa 83:6</a>). They are distinguished from the Ishmaelites.

 <p><a name="007"><b>Hagagi</b></a>     Festive, one of the twelve so-called minor prophets. He was the first of the three (Zechariah, his contemporary, and Malachi, who was about one hundred years later, being the other two) whose ministry belonged to the period of Jewish history which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began his ministry about sixteen years after the Return. The work of rebuilding the temple had been put a stop to through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having been suspended for fifteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zechariah (<a href="../kjv/ezr006.htm#014">Ezr 6:14</a>), who by their exhortations roused the people from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of the favourable opportunity that had arisen in a change in the policy of the Persian government. (See DARIUS [2].) Haggai's prophecies have thus been characterized: "There is a ponderous and simple dignity in the emphatic reiteration addressed alike to every class of the community, prince, priest, and people, 'Be strong, be strong, be strong' (<a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#004">Hag 2:4</a>). 'Cleave, stick fast, to the work you have to do;' or again, 'Consider your ways, consider, consider, consider' (<a href="../kjv/hag001.htm#005">Hag 1:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/hag001.htm#007">Hag 1:7</a>; <a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#015">Hag 2:15</a>, <a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#018">Hag 2:18</a>). It is the Hebrew phrase for the endeavour, characteristic of the gifted seers of all times, to compel their hearers to turn the inside of their hearts outwards to their own view, to take the mask from off their consciences, to 'see life steadily, and to see it wholly.'" Stanley's Jewish Church. (See SIGNET.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Haggai, Book of</b></a>     Consists of two brief, comprehensive chapters. The object of the prophet was generally to urge the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the temple. Chapter first comprehends the first address (<a href="../kjv/hag001.htm#002">Hag 1:2</a>) and its effects (<a href="../kjv/hag001.htm#012">Hag 1:12</a>). Chapter second contains,     (1.) The second prophecy (<a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#001">Hag 2:1</a>), which was delivered a month after the first. (2.) The third prophecy (<a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#010">Hag 2:10</a>), delivered two months and three days after the second; and (3.) The fourth prophecy (<a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#020">Hag 2:20</a>), delivered on the same day as the third. These discourses are referred to in <a href="../kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/ezr006.htm#014">Ezr 6:14</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb012.htm#026">Heb 12:26</a>. (Compare <a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#007">Hag 2:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#008">Hag 2:8</a>, <a href="../kjv/hag002.htm#022">Hag 2:22</a>.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Haggith</b></a>     Festive; the dancer, a wife of David and the mother of Adonijah (<a href="../kjv/sa2003.htm#004">Sa2 3:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1001.htm#005">Kg1 1:5</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg1001.htm#011">Kg1 1:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#013">Kg1 2:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1003.htm#002">Ch1 3:2</a>), who, like Absalom, was famed for his beauty.
