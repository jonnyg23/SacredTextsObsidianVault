 <p><a name="000"><b>Homer</b></a>     Heap, the largest of dry measures, containing about 8 bushels or 1 quarter English = 10 ephahs (<a href="../kjv/lev027.htm#016">Lev 27:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/num011.htm#032">Num 11:32</a>) = a COR. (See OMER.) "Half a homer," a grain measure mentioned only in <a href="../kjv/hos003.htm#002">Hos 3:2</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="001"><b>Honey</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  ya'ar , occurs only <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#025">Sa1 14:25</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#027">Sa1 14:27</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#029">Sa1 14:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/sol005.htm#001">Sol 5:1</a>, where it denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies a forest or copse, and refers to honey found in woods. (2.)  Nopheth , honey that drops (<a href="../kjv/psa019.htm#010">Psa 19:10</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro005.htm#003">Pro 5:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/sol004.htm#011">Sol 4:11</a>). (3.)  Debash  denotes bee-honey (<a href="../kjv/jdg014.htm#008">Jdg 14:8</a>); but also frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees (<a href="../kjv/gen043.htm#011">Gen 43:11</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze027.htm#017">Eze 27:17</a>). In these passages it may probably mean "dibs," or syrup of grapes, i.e., the juice of ripe grapes boiled down to one-third of its bulk. (4.)  Tsuph , the cells of the honey-comb full of honey (<a href="../kjv/pro016.htm#024">Pro 16:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa019.htm#010">Psa 19:10</a>). (5.) "Wild honey" (<a href="../kjv/mat003.htm#004">Mat 3:4</a>) may have been the vegetable honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey stored by bees in rocks or in trees (<a href="../kjv/deu032.htm#013">Deu 32:13</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa081.htm#016">Psa 81:16</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1014.htm#025">Sa1 14:25</a>).    Canaan was a "land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="../kjv/exo003.htm#008">Exo 3:8</a>). Milk and honey were among the chief dainties in the earlier ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and butter and honey are also mentioned among articles of food (<a href="../kjv/isa007.htm#015">Isa 7:15</a>). The ancients used honey instead of sugar (<a href="../kjv/psa119.htm#103">Psa 119:103</a>; <a href="../kjv/pro024.htm#013">Pro 24:13</a>); but when taken in great quantities it caused nausea, a fact referred to in <a href="../kjv/pro025.htm#016">Pro 25:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/pro025.htm#017">Pro 25:17</a> to inculcate moderation in pleasures. Honey and milk also are put for sweet discourse (<a href="../kjv/sol004.htm#011">Sol 4:11</a>).

 <p><a name="002"><b>Hood</b></a>     (Heb.  tsaniph ) a tiara round the head (<a href="../kjv/isa003.htm#023">Isa 3:23</a>; R.V., pl., "turbans"). Rendered "diadem," <a href="../kjv/job029.htm#014">Job 29:14</a>; high priest's "mitre," <a href="../kjv/zac003.htm#005">Zac 3:5</a>; "royal diadem," <a href="../kjv/isa062.htm#003">Isa 62:3</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Hoof</b></a>     A cleft hoof as of neat cattle (<a href="../kjv/exo010.htm#026">Exo 10:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze032.htm#013">Eze 32:13</a>); hence also of the horse, though not cloven (<a href="../kjv/isa005.htm#028">Isa 5:28</a>). The "parting of the hoof" is one of the distinctions between clean and unclean animals (<a href="../kjv/lev011.htm#003">Lev 11:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/deu014.htm#007">Deu 14:7</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Hook</b></a>      (1.) Heb.  hah , a "ring" inserted in the nostrils of animals to which a cord was fastened for the purpose of restraining them (<a href="../kjv/kg2019.htm#028">Kg2 19:28</a>; <a href="../kjv/isa037.htm#028">Isa 37:28</a>, <a href="../kjv/isa037.htm#029">Isa 37:29</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze029.htm#004">Eze 29:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze038.htm#004">Eze 38:4</a>). "The Orientals make use of this contrivance for curbing their work-beasts... When a beast becomes unruly they have only to draw the cord on one side, which, by stopping his breath, punishes him so effectually that after a few repetitions he fails not to become quite tractable whenever he begins to feel it" (Michaelis). So God's agents are never beyond his control. (2.)  Hakkah , a fish "hook" (<a href="../kjv/job041.htm#002">Job 41:2</a>, Heb. Text, Job 40:25; <a href="../kjv/isa019.htm#008">Isa 19:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/hab001.htm#015">Hab 1:15</a>). (3.)  Vav , a "peg" on which the curtains of the tabernacle were hung (<a href="../kjv/exo026.htm#032">Exo 26:32</a>). (4.)  Tsinnah , a fish-hooks (<a href="../kjv/amo004.htm#002">Amo 4:2</a>). (5.)  Mazleg , flesh-hooks (<a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#013">Sa1 2:13</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#014">Sa1 2:14</a>), a kind of fork with three teeth for turning the sacrifices on the fire, etc. (6.)  Mazmeroth , pruning-hooks (<a href="../kjv/isa002.htm#004">Isa 2:4</a>; <a href="../kjv/joe003.htm#010">Joe 3:10</a>). (7.)  'Agmon  (<a href="../kjv/job041.htm#002">Job 41:2</a>, Heb. Text, Job 40:26), incorrectly rendered in the Authorized Version. Properly a rush-rope for binding animals, as in Revised Version margin.

 <p><a name="005"><b>Hope</b></a>     One of the three main elements of Christian character (<a href="../kjv/co1013.htm#013">Co1 13:13</a>). It is joined to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing or possessing (<a href="../kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</a>; <a href="../kjv/jo1003.htm#002">Jo1 3:2</a>). "Hope is an essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so essential indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence of Christianity (<a href="../kjv/pe1003.htm#015">Pe1 3:15</a>; <a href="../kjv/heb010.htm#023">Heb 10:23</a>). In it the whole glory of the Christian vocation is centred (<a href="../kjv/eph001.htm#018">Eph 1:18</a>; <a href="../kjv/eph004.htm#004">Eph 4:4</a>)." Unbelievers are without this hope (<a href="../kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</a>; <a href="../kjv/th1004.htm#013">Th1 4:13</a>). Christ is the actual object of the believer's hope, because it is in his second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled (<a href="../kjv/ti1001.htm#001">Ti1 1:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/col001.htm#027">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/tit002.htm#013">Tit 2:13</a>). It is spoken of as "lively", i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable, but having a perennial life (<a href="../kjv/pe1001.htm#003">Pe1 1:3</a>). In <a href="../kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2</a> the "hope" spoken of is probably objective, i.e., "the hope set before us," namely, eternal life (compare <a href="../kjv/rom012.htm#012">Rom 12:12</a>). In <a href="../kjv/jo1003.htm#003">Jo1 3:3</a> the expression "hope in him" ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version, "hope on him," i.e., a hope based on God. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Hophni</b></a>     Pugilist or client, one of the two sons of Eli, the high priest (<a href="../kjv/sa1001.htm#003">Sa1 1:3</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#034">Sa1 2:34</a>), who, because he was "very old," resigned to them the active duties of his office. By their scandalous conduct they brought down a curse on their father's house (<a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#022">Sa1 2:22</a>, 12-27, <a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#027">Sa1 2:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/sa1003.htm#011">Sa1 3:11</a>). For their wickedness they were called "sons of Belial," i.e., worthless men (<a href="../kjv/sa1002.htm#012">Sa1 2:12</a>). They both perished in the disastrous battle with the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="../kjv/sa1004.htm#011">Sa1 4:11</a>). (See PHINEHAS.) 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Hophra</b></a>     I.e., PHARAOH-HOPHRA (called Apries by the Greek historian Herodotus) king of Egypt (591-572 B.C.) in the time of Zedekiah, king of Judah (<a href="../kjv/jer037.htm#005">Jer 37:5</a> <a href="../kjv/jer044.htm#030">Jer 44:30</a>; <a href="../kjv/eze029.htm#006">Eze 29:6</a>, <a href="../kjv/eze029.htm#007">Eze 29:7</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Hor</b></a>     Mountain.     (1.) One of the mountains of the chain of Seir or Edom, on the confines of Idumea (<a href="../kjv/num020.htm#022">Num 20:22</a>; <a href="../kjv/num033.htm#037">Num 33:37</a>). It was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="../kjv/num033.htm#037">Num 33:37</a>), which they reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron died (<a href="../kjv/num033.htm#037">Num 33:37</a>). (See AARON.) The Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings. It bears the modern name of Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most conspicuous of the whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow between which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others, however, suppose that this mountain is the modern Jebel Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the western, side of the Arabah. (2.) One of the marks of the northern boundary of Palestine (<a href="../kjv/num034.htm#007">Num 34:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/num034.htm#008">Num 34:8</a>). Nowhere else mentioned. Perhaps it is one of the peaks of Lebanon. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Horeb</b></a>     Desert or mountain of the dried up ground, a general name for the whole mountain range of which Sinai was one of the summits (<a href="../kjv/exo003.htm#001">Exo 3:1</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo017.htm#006">Exo 17:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/exo033.htm#006">Exo 33:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/psa106.htm#019">Psa 106:19</a>, etc.). The modern name of the whole range is Jebel Musa. It is a huge mountain block, about 2 miles long by about 1 in breadth, with a very spacious plain at its north-east end, called the Er Rahah, in which the Israelites encamped for nearly a whole year. (See SINAI.)
