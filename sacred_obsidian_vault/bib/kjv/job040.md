 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 40</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a> with a voice like him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and beauty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Hide them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> together; and bind their faces in secret.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold now <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#003">behemoth</a>, which I made with thee; he eateth <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> as an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He moveth his tail like a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> His bones are as strong <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>; his bones are like bars of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> to approach unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a>, and fens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The shady trees cover him with their <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>; the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#006">willows</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> compass him about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> into his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.<br>
