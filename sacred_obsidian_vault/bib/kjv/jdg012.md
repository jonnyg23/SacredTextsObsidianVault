 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> gathered themselves together, and went <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</a>, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> gathered together all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, and fought with <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>: and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> smote <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the Gileadites took the passages of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then said they unto him, Say now <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#009">Shibboleth</a>: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> six years. Then died <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And after him <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#000">Ibzan</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a> judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then died <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#000">Ibzan</a>, and was buried at <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And after him <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#000">Elon</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#002">Zebulonite</a>, judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and he judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> ten years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#000">Elon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#002">Zebulonite</a> died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And after him <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#002">Abdon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#009">Hillel</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#003">Pirathonite</a>, judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> colts: and he judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> eight years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#002">Abdon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#009">Hillel</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#003">Pirathonite</a> died, and was buried in <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#002">Pirathon</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of the Amalekites.<br>
