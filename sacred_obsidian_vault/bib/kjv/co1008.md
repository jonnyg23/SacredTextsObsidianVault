 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a> edifieth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But if any man love God, the same is known of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As concerning therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> of those things that are offered in <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto idols, we know that an <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For though there be that are called gods, whether in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, by whom are all things, and we by him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a>; and their <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> being weak is defiled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, shall not the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> died?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But when ye <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> so against the brethren, and wound their weak <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>, ye <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.<br>
