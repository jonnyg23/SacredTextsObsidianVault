 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 32</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> went on his way, and the angels of God met him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> saw them, he said, This is God's <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>: and he called the name of that place <a href="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> sent messengers before him to <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> his brother unto the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>; Thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> saith thus, I have sojourned with <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a>, and stayed there until now:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in thy sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the messengers returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, saying, We came to thy brother <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And said, If <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said, O God of my father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and God of my father <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>; and now I am become two <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> his brother;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>: and, behold, also he is behind us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, when ye find him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#001">ford</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#006">Jabbok</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he took them, and sent them over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a>, and sent over that he had.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, but <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for as a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And as he passed over <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Therefore the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.<br>
