 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 38</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In those days was <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> sick unto death. And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</a> came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> wept sore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then came the word of the LORD to <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Go, and say to <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, Thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father, I have heard thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>: and I will defend this city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of the degrees, which is gone down in the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#000">dial</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a>, ten degrees backward. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I said in the <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#000">cutting</a> off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>: I am deprived of the residue of my years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Like a <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#002">crane</a> or a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a>, so did I chatter: I did <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> as a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a>: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> cannot hope for thy truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</a> to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a>, and he shall recover.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?<br>
