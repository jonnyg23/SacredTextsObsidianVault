 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there happened to be there a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a>, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, neither have we inheritance in the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>: every man to his tents, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> So every man of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went up from after <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and followed <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri: but the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> clave unto their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> even to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> came to his house at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a>, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a>, Assemble me the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> within three days, and be thou here present.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> went to assemble the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a>, Now shall <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri do us more harm than did <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#000">Pelethites</a>, and all the mighty men: and they went out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to pursue after <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> When they were at the great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> with a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a>, Art thou in health, my brother? And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</a> with the right hand to <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a> him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> took no heed to the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> his brother pursued after <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and he that is for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, let him go after <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> wallowed in <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a>. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a> into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When he was removed out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a>, all the people went on after <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, to pursue after <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he went through all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a>, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they came and besieged him in <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> battered the wall, to throw it down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then cried a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>. And he answered, I do hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a>: and so they ended the matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> I am one of them that are peaceable and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: why wilt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> up the inheritance of the LORD?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> up or destroy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The matter is not so: but a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, even against <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> the son of Bichri, and cast it out to <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> was over all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> was over the Cherethites and over the <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#000">Pelethites</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#001">Adoram</a> was over the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the son of Ahilud was <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#005">recorder</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#007">Sheva</a> was scribe: and <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> were the priests:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#000">Ira</a> also the Jairite was a chief ruler about <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
