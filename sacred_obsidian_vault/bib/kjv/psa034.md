 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 34</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> This <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Many are the <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a> of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.<br>
