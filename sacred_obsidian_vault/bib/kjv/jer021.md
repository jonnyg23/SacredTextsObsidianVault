 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word which came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD, when <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> sent unto him <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#002">Pashur</a> the son of Melchiah, and <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#008">Zephaniah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> unto them, Thus shall ye say to <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, and in great wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>: they shall die of a great pestilence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and from the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He that abideth in this city shall die by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and he shall burn it with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And touching the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But I will punish you according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.<br>
