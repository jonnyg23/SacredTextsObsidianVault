 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After this there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the Jews; and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Now there is at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> market a pool, which is called in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> tongue <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#009">Bethesda</a>, having five porches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#002">halt</a>, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Afterward <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> findeth him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, which had made him whole.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And therefore did the Jews persecute <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> If I bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of myself, my <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> is not true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> There is another that beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of me; and I know that the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> which he witnesseth of me is true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Ye sent unto John, and he bare <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto the truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But I receive not <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> But I have greater <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of me, that the Father hath sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> I receive not honour from men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, in whom ye trust.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> For had ye believed <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<br>
