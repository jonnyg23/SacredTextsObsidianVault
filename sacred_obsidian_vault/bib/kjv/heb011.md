 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For by it the elders obtained a good report.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</a> offered unto God a more excellent <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> than <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, by which he obtained <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#004">Enoch</a> was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>, that he pleased God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> which is by faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, the heirs with him of the same promise:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> who had promised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, when he was tried, offered up <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Of whom it was said, That in <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> shall thy seed be called:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> concerning things to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and gave commandment concerning his bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> By faith <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> for a season;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Esteeming the reproach of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> greater riches than the treasures in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> By faith he forsook <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, not fearing the wrath of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Through faith he kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, and the sprinkling of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> By faith the walls of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> fell down, after they were compassed about <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> By faith the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</a> perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</a> with peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#005">Barak</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a>, and of Jephthae; of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> also, and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, and of the prophets:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.<br>
