 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The fining pot is for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: but the LORD trieth the hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to a naughty tongue.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Whoso mocketh the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Children's children are the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of old men; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of children are their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> is as a precious <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> A reproof entereth more into a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man than an hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> into a fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> shall be sent against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> in the presence of his friend.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> seeketh <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> drieth the bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> A wicked man taketh a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a> to pervert the ways of judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.<br>
