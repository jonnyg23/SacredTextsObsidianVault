 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> had riches and honour in abundance, and joined <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#005">affinity</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And after certain years he went down to <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> killed <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said, Is there not here a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#006">Imla</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said, Let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> say so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#006">Imla</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> sat either of them on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</a> had made him horns of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> until they be consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> that went to call <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when he was come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a>, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then he said, I did see all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> scattered upon the mountains, as <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> that have no <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> standing on his right hand and on his left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the LORD said, Who shall entice <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then there came out a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</a> came near, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</a>, and said, Which way went the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> to hide thyself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said, Take ye <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a>, and carry him back to <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a> the governor of the city, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> the king's son;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And say, Thus saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Put this fellow in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and feed him with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went up to Ramothgilead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> disguised himself; and they went to the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, that they said, It is the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, they turned back again from pursuing him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And a certain man drew a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> at a venture, and smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> between the joints of the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#007">harness</a>: therefore he said to his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>; for I am wounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stayed himself up in his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> going down he died.<br>
