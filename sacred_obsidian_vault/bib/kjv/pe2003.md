 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Peter Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#004">elements</a> shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#004">elements</a> shall melt with fervent heat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>; even as our beloved brother <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As also in all his <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#000">epistles</a>, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But grow in <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, and in the knowledge of our Lord and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>. To him be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> both now and for ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
