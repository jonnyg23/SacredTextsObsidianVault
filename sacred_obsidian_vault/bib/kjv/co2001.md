 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> by the will of God, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#002">Timothy</a> our brother, unto the church of God which is at <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#002">Corinth</a>, with all the saints which are in all <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who comforteth us in all our <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For as the sufferings of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Ye also helping together by <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> for us, that for the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For our rejoicing is this, the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of our <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God, we have had our <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And to pass by you into <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>, and to come again out of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the Son of God, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a>, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God by us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Now he which stablisheth us with you in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and hath anointed us, is God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Who hath also sealed us, and given the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> in our hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#002">Corinth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.<br>
