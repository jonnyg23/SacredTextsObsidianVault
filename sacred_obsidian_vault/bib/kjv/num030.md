 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 30</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> to bind his soul with a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a>; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a>, being in her father's house in her youth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And her father hear her vow, and her <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a> shall stand, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a> shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a> shall stand, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>, or concerning the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Every vow, and every binding <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.<br>
