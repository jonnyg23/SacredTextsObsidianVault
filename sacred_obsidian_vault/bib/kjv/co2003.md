 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#000">epistles</a> of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the living God; not in <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, but in fleshy <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of the heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And such trust have we through <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to God-ward:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>; not of the letter, but of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: for the letter killeth, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> giveth life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> could not stedfastly behold the face of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> for the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his countenance; which <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> was to be done away:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> How shall not the ministration of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> be rather glorious?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For if the ministration of condemnation be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, much more doth the ministration of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> exceed in <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For even that which was made glorious had no <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in this respect, by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> that excelleth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And not as <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, which put a vail over his face, that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>; which vail is done away in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But even unto this day, when <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> is read, the vail is upon their heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now the Lord is that <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>: and where the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the Lord is, there is liberty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the Lord, are changed into the same image from <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, even as by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD.<br>
