 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In those days there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and in those days the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</a>, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</a>, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, they lodged there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> When they were by the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, they knew the voice of the young man the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a>: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> with me, and hath hired me, and I am his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then the five men departed, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</a>, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#008">magistrate</a> in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they came unto their brethren to <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</a>: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</a> and out of <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</a>, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they passed thence unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and came unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</a>, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</a>, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a>, even unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, and saluted him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, stood by the entering of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</a>, and the molten image: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> stood in the entering of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</a>, and the molten image. Then said the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> unto them, What do ye?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: is it better for thee to be a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> unto the house of one man, or that thou be a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> unto a <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> and a family in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</a>, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#000">carriage</a> before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when they were a good way from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they cried unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>. And they turned their faces, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> went their way: and when <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And they took the things which <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> had made, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> which he had, and came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</a>, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and burnt the city with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And there was no deliverer, because it was far from <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</a>, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And they called the name of the city <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, after the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> their father, who was born unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: howbeit the name of the city was <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</a> at the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> set up the graven image: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#008">Gershom</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, he and his sons were priests to the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> until the day of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>.<br>
