 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And there was a certain man of <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</a>, of the family of the Danites, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a>; and his wife was <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>, and bare not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> not <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> nor strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and eat not any unclean thing:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#009">razor</a> shall come on his head: for the child shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#008">Nazarite</a> unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> nor strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#008">Nazarite</a> to God from the womb to the day of his death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And God hearkened to the voice of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> her husband was not with her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a>, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, neither let her <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> or strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a>, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: and if thou wilt offer a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> knew not that he was an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> took a kid with a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, and offered it upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> unto the LORD: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> did wonderously; and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> and his wife looked on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> from off the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD ascended in the flame of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD did no more appear to <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> and to his wife. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> knew that he was an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#007">Manoah</a> said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the woman bare a son, and called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a>: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD began to move him at times in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> between <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</a>.<br>
