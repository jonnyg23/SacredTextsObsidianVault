 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, and go speak unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> to eat, and fill thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> with this <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> for sweetness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and speak with my words unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> are impudent and hardhearted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</a> strong against their foreheads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> As an <a href="../ebd/ebd008.htm#001">adamant</a> harder than <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</a> have I made thy <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</a>: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And go, get thee to them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD from his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then I came to them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</a>, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it came to pass at the end of <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> will I require at thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> will I require at thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> not, and he doth not <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>, and I will there talk with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then I arose, and went forth into the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>: and, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD stood there, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> which I saw by the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</a>: and I fell on my face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a>, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.<br>
