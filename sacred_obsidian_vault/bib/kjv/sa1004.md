 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the word of <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> came to all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. Now <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went out against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> pitched in Aphek.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> put themselves in array against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and when they joined battle, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was smitten before the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when the people were come into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>? Let us fetch the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD out of <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So the people sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, that they might bring from thence the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>, were there with the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD came into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>? And they understood that the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD was come into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> were afraid, for they said, God is come into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, that ye be not servants unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> fought, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was smitten, and they fled every man into his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> thirty thousand footmen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God was taken; and the two sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>, were slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And there ran a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> out of the army, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> the same day with his clothes <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>, and with earth upon his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when he came, lo, <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the man said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a>, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> answered and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is fled before the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>, are dead, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God is taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it came to pass, when he made mention of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a> brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And she named the child <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#002">Ichabod</a>, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> is departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: because the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And she said, The <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> is departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God is taken.<br>
