 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezra Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then the prophets, Haggai the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#005">Iddo</a>, prophesied unto the Jews that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> in the name of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, even unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then rose up <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#003">Shealtiel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</a> the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> At the same time came to them <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#006">Tatnai</a>, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a>: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The copy of the letter that <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#006">Tatnai</a>, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#000">Apharsachites</a>, which were on this side the river, sent unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, all peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Be it known unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that we went into the province of <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#004">Judea</a>, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> on, and prospereth in their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> builded and set up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But after that our fathers had provoked the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But in the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> the same <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> made a decree to build this house of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the vessels also of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> of the house of God, which <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> took out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and brought them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, those did <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> take out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#003">Sheshbazzar</a>, whom he had made governor;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and let the house of God be builded in his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then came the same <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#003">Sheshbazzar</a>, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now therefore, if it seem good to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, whether it be so, that a decree was made of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to build this house of God at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.<br>
