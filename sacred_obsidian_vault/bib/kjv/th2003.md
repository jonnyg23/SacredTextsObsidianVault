 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But the Lord is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a> which he received of us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Neither did we eat any man's <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that with quietness they work, and eat their own <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be with you all. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
