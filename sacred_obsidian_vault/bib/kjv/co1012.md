 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Ye know that ye were <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, carried away unto these <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> idols, even as ye were led.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God calleth <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> accursed: and that no man can say that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> is the Lord, but by the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the manifestation of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> is given to every man to profit withal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For to one is given by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> To another faith by the same <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>; to another the gifts of healing by the same <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> To another the working of miracles; to another <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, dividing to every man severally as he will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For by one <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, whether we be <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> or free; and have been all made to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> into one <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the body is not one member, but many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And if the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And if they were all one member, where were the body?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But now are they many members, yet but one body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> That there should be no <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#008">schism</a> in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Now ye are the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and members in particular.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#007">helps</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#007">governments</a>, diversities of tongues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.<br>
