 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Lord of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, with respect of persons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</a>, in goodly <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and there come in also a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man in vile raiment;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, Stand thou there, or sit here under my <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But ye have despised the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a>, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For he that said, Do not commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For he shall have judgment without <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, that hath shewed no <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> rejoiceth against judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> If a brother or sister be <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and destitute of daily food,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Was not <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> our father justified by works, when he had offered <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his son upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> was fulfilled which saith, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> believed God, and it was imputed unto him for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: and he was called the Friend of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Likewise also was not <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a> justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For as the body without the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> is dead, so faith without works is dead also.<br>
