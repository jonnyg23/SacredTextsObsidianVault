 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the fifth <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> sounded, and I saw a star fall from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> unto the earth: and to him was given the <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</a> of the bottomless <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he opened the bottomless <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>; and there arose a smoke out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, as the smoke of a great <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</a> of the earth have power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> of God in their foreheads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a> was as the <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a> of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and their faces were as the faces of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they had tails like unto <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</a>, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they had a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over them, which is the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the bottomless <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, whose name in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> tongue is <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#003">Abaddon</a>, but in the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a> tongue hath his name <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#007">Apollyon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the sixth <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> which is before God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Saying to the sixth <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And thus I saw the horses in the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#006">jacinth</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>, which issued out of their mouths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> devils, and idols of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, nor of their thefts.<br>
