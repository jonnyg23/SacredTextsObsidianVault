 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, put forth a <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</a>, and speak a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a> with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, and took the highest <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it grew, and became a spreading <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> There was also another great <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a> with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, that it might be a goodly <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?  tell them, Behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> is come to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and hath taken the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with him, and hath taken an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> it might stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and be delivered?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> dwelleth that made him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, whose <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> he despised, and whose <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> he brake, even with him in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> he shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Neither shall <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Seeing he despised the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> by breaking the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> that he hath despised, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And I will spread my <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> upon him, and he shall be taken in my <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>, and I will bring him to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And all his fugitives with all his <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a>: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> In the mountain of the height of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, and be a goodly <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of the branches thereof shall they dwell.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.<br>
