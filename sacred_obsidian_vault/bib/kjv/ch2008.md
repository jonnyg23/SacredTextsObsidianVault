 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That the cities which Huram had restored to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> built them, and caused the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to dwell there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he built <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#004">Tadmor</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and all the store cities, which he built in <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#006">Baalath</a>, and all the store cities that <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> desired to build in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, and throughout all the land of his dominion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> As for all the people that were left of the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a>, which were not of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> consumed not, them did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> make to pay <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> until this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And these were the chief of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> brought up the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> out of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, because the places are holy, whereunto the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD hath come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Even after a certain rate every day, <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> according to the commandment of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of weeks, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of tabernacles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he appointed, according to the order of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father, the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a> of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a> at every <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: for so had <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the man of God commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they departed not from the commandment of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now all the work of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then went <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a>, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and brought them to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
