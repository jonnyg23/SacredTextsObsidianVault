 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 49</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> no sons?  hath he no <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a>? why then doth their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> inherit <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a>, and his people dwell in his cities?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</a> of war to be heard in <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a> of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Howl, O <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a>, for <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a>, gird you with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall go into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, and his priests and his princes together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And afterward I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#001">Teman</a>? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Flee ye, turn back, dwell <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>, O inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#005">Dedan</a>; for I will bring the calamity of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> upon him, the time that I will visit him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But I have made <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> trust in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</a> shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#008">ambassador</a> is sent unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For, lo, I will make thee small among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and despised among men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a>, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> at all the plagues thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As in the overthrow of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a> and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#001">swelling</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> against the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> that will stand before me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#001">Teman</a>: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Behold, he shall come up and <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a>, and spread his wings over <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</a>: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a> is confounded, and <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#002">Arpad</a>: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</a>, and concerning the kingdoms of <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</a>, and spoil the men of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Flee, get you far off, dwell <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>, O ye inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</a>, saith the LORD; for <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And their camels shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#006">booty</a>, and the multitude of their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> a spoil: and I will scatter into all <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</a> shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> The word of the LORD that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a> in the beginning of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a>, the chief of their might.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And upon <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a> will I bring the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> from the four quarters of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and will scatter them toward all those <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a>; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a> shall not come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For I will cause <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a> to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, saith the LORD; and I will send the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> after them, till I have consumed them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And I will set my <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a>, and will destroy from thence the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and the princes, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
