 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The beginning of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The voice of one crying in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> John did baptize in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and preach the baptism of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> for the remission of sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and were all baptized of him in the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, confessing their sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#006">latchet</a> of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it came to pass in those days, that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came from <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and was baptized of John in <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> like a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a> descending upon him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And there came a voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And immediately the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> driveth him into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he was there in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> forty days, tempted of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now after that John was put in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, preaching the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of the kingdom of God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now as he walked by the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, he saw <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a> his brother casting a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> into the sea: for they were fishers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a>, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And straightway he called them: and they left their father <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a> in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they went into <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>; and straightway on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day he entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, and taught.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And there was in their <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> a man with an unclean <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>; and he cried out,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when the unclean <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And forthwith, when they were come out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, they entered into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> and John.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</a>, and anon they tell him of her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</a> left her, and she ministered unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And at even, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And all the city was gathered together at the door.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> and they that were with him followed after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and cast out devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a> departed from him, and he was cleansed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and offer for thy cleansing those things which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> commanded, for a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> places: and they came to him from every quarter.<br>
