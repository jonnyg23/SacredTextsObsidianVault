 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 45</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a>, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and cut in sunder the bars of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will give thee the treasures of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> my servant's sake, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> That they may know from the rising of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I form the light, and create <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: let the earth open, and let them bring forth <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, and let <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> spring up together; I the LORD have created it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#004">potsherd</a> strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a> say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> have I commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I have raised him up in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thus saith the LORD, The labour of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and merchandise of <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#006">Sabeans</a>, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be saved in the LORD with an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, I declare things that are right.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time?  have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>; there is none beside me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, every tongue shall swear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> In the LORD shall all the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be justified, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
