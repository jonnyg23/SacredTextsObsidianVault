 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</a> of thine eye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> which flattereth with her words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For at the window of my house I looked through my <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#003">casement</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>, and subtil of heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I have perfumed my bed with <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#004">aloes</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#004">cinnamon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He hath taken a <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</a> of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He goeth after her straightway, as an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Till a <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#009">dart</a> strike through his <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#004">liver</a>; as a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> hasteth to the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>, and knoweth not that it is for his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Her house is the way to <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, going down to the chambers of death.<br>
