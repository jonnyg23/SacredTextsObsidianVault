 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, bringing the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a> which they had prepared, and certain others with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they found the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> rolled away from the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they remembered his words,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And returned from the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> It was <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#009">Joanna</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then arose <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and ran unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>; and stooping down, he beheld the <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#001">Emmaus</a>, which was from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> about threescore furlongs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> himself drew near, and went with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the one of them, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#007">Cleopas</a>, answering said unto him, Art thou only a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, which was a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of angels, which said that he was alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And certain of them which were with us went to the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Ought not <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to have suffered these things, and to enter into his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And beginning at <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And as they thus spake, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> hath not <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and bones, as ye see me have.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And they gave him a piece of a broiled <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a>, and of an honeycomb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And he took it, and did eat before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and in the prophets, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</a>, concerning me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And that <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And ye are witnesses of these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, until ye be endued with power from on high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And he led them out as far as to <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a>, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And they worshipped him, and returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with great joy:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And were continually in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, praising and blessing God. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
