 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which was found in the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> stood by a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</a> the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD all the vessels that were made for <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and for the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>, and for all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and he burned them without <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> in the fields of <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>, and carried the <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a> of them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> had ordained to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> in the high places in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the places round about <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; them also that burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, and to the planets, and to all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he brought out the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a> from the house of the LORD, without <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>, and burned it at the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he brake down the houses of the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#006">sodomites</a>, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he brought all the priests out of the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#004">Geba</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, but they did eat of the unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> among their brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he defiled Topheth, which is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he took away the horses that the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> had given to the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> of Nathanmelech the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</a>, which was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a>, and burned the chariots of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the altars that were on the top of the upper <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a>, which the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> had made, and the altars which <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the high places that were before <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which were on the right hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of corruption, which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had builded for <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#006">Ashtoreth</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of the Zidonians, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of the Moabites, and for Milcom the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, did the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> defile.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he brake in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> that was at <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and the high place which <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, who made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, had made, both that <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> of the man of God, which came from <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> that came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, which the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had made to provoke the Lord to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded all the people, saying, Keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Surely there was not holden such a <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> from the days of the judges that judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, nor in all the days of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, nor of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But in the eighteenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a>, wherein this <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> was holden to the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, did <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> found in the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And like unto him was there no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>; neither after him arose there any like him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, because of all the provocations that <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> had provoked him withal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the LORD said, I will remove <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> also out of my sight, as I have removed <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and will cast off this city <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> which I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> In his days Pharaohnechoh <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> went up against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> to the river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> went against him; and he slew him at <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#004">Megiddo</a>, when he had seen him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And his servants carried him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> dead from <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#004">Megiddo</a>, and brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and buried him in his own <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>. And the people of the land took <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a>, and anointed him, and made him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his father's stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#009">Hamutal</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And Pharaohnechoh put him in <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>, that he might not reign in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and put the land to a <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> of an hundred talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And Pharaohnechoh made <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#000">Eliakim</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in the room of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> his father, and turned his name to <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a>, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> away: and he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and died there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> gave the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: he exacted the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.

 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.<br>
