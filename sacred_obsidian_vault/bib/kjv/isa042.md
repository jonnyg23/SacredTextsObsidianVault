 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 42</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A bruised <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a> shall he not break, and the smoking <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a> shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> to them that walk therein:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I the LORD have called thee in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the people, for a light of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> To open the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and them that sit in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</a> doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Let them give <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And I will bring the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, that ye may see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Who is <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, but my servant? or deaf, as my <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> that I sent?  who is <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> as he that is perfect, and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> as the LORD's servant?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Who among you will give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Who gave <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> for a spoil, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Therefore he hath poured upon him the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.<br>
