 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 John Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Whosoever committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> transgresseth also the law: for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is the transgression of the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> is righteous, even as he is righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, because he is born of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>: whosoever doeth not <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Not as <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</a>, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> which he hath given us.<br>
