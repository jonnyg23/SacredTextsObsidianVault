 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Sufficient to such a man is this <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a>, which was inflicted of many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Lest <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Furthermore, when I came to <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</a> to preach Christ's <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I had no rest in my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, because I found not <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a> my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For we are unto God a sweet savour of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
