 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; We have a strong city; <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> will God appoint for walls and <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#005">bulwarks</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#009">JEHOVAH</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> strength:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and the steps of the needy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> when thy chastening was upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>: for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> is as the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and shall no more cover her slain.<br>
