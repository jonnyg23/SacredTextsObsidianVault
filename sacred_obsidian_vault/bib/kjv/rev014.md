 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I looked, and, lo, a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> stood on the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</a>, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I heard a voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a>: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they sung as it were a new song before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I saw another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, having the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him that made <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there followed another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of the wrath of her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the third <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> and his image, and receive his mark in his <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</a>, or in his hand,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The same shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a> in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the smoke of their <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a> ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I heard a voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I looked, and behold a white <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>, and in his hand a sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> came out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, Thrust in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a>, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> of the earth is ripe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he that sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> thrust in his <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a> on the earth; and the earth was reaped.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> came out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, he also having a sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> came out from the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a>, saying, Thrust in thy sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a>, and gather the clusters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> thrust in his <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#008">sickle</a> into the earth, and gathered the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the winepress was trodden without the city, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.<br>
