 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Behold, the Assyrian was a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The waters made him great, the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> All the fowls of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> dwelt all great nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>, that were in the garden of God, envied him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>, and have left him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> I caused a mourning: I covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> with them that descend into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>: and all the trees of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>, the choice and best of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, all that <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They also went down into <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> with him unto them that be slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> To whom art thou thus like in <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and in greatness among the trees of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a> unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>. This is <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
