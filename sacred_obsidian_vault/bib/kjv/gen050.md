 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 50</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the days of his mourning were past, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> spake unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, saying, If now I have found <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> which I have digged for me in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they came to the threshingfloor of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#009">Atad</a>, which is beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and there they mourned with a great and very sore <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>: and he made a mourning for his father <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when the inhabitants of the land, the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, saw the mourning in the floor of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#009">Atad</a>, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For his sons carried him into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, and buried him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> of the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#007">Machpelah</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the Hittite, before <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> returned into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they sent a <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So shall ye say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> wept when they spake unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, he, and his father's house: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> lived an hundred and ten years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> saw Ephraim's children of the third <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>: the children also of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#006">Machir</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> were brought up upon Joseph's knees.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> took an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#001">coffin</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
