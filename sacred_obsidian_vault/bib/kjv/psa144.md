 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 144</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Man is like to vanity: his days are as a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> that passeth away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</a> thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Cast forth <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</a>, and scatter them: shoot out thine <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a>, and destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#006">psaltery</a> and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> It is he that giveth <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto kings: who delivereth <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his servant from the hurtful <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> may bring forth <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> and ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> in our streets:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.<br>
