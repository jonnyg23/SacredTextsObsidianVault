 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</a> answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, are broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> received a little thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> sleep falleth on men,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> passed before my face; the hair of my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> stood up:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> How much less in them that dwell in houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, whose foundation is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, which are crushed before the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.<br>
