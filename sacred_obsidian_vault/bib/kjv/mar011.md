 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when they came nigh to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, unto Bethphage and <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a>, at the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they said unto them even as <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had commanded: and they let them go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they brought the colt to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#001">Hosanna</a>; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Blessed be the kingdom of our father <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that cometh in the name of the Lord: <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#001">Hosanna</a> in the highest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> entered into <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a> with the twelve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And on the morrow, when they were come from <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a>, he was hungry:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And seeing a <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto it, No man eat <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they come to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and overthrew the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>? but ye have made it a <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of thieves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when even was come, he went out of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree dried up from the roots.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree which thou cursedst is withered away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> may forgive you your trespasses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> forgive your trespasses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And they come again to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and as he was walking in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, there come to him the chief priests, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, and the elders,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The baptism of John, was it from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, or of men? answer me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> indeed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they answered and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, We cannot tell. And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.<br>
