 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 49</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> of my mother hath he made mention of my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he hath made my mouth like a sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#000">quiver</a> hath he hid me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, in whom I will be glorified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> again to him, Though <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and to restore the preserved of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: I will also give thee for a light to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, that thou mayest be my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto the end of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Thus saith the LORD, the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>, because of the LORD that is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>, and the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and he shall choose thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> smite them: for he that hath <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon his afflicted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> doeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> delivered?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; and they shall be drunken with their own <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, as with sweet <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>: and all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall know that I the LORD am thy <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a>, the mighty One of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
