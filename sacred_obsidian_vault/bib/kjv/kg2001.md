 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> rebelled against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> fell down through a <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#008">lattice</a> in his upper <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a> whether I shall recover of this disease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said to <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</a>, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a>? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#009">leather</a> about his loins. And he said, It is <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath said, Come down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and consumed him and his fifty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Come down quickly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and consumed him and his fifty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, there came fire down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a>, is it not because there is no God in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So he died according to the word of the LORD which <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> had spoken. And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> reigned in his stead in the second year of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; because he had no son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> which he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
