 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made a great <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> to a thousand of his lords, and drank <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> before the thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a>, whiles he tasted the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, commanded to bring the golden and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> vessels which his father <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> had taken out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> which was in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the house of God which was at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They drank <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and praised the gods of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</a> upon the plaister of the wall of the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> saw the part of the hand that wrote.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> spake, and said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, Whosoever shall read this <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, and have a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> about his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then came in all the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men: but they could not read the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, nor make known to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> the interpretation thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then was <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a> greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> by reason of the words of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and his lords came into the <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#006">banquet</a> house: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> spake and said, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> thy father, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, I say, thy father, made master of the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a>, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Forasmuch as an excellent <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> named <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#002">Belteshazzar</a>: now let <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> be called, and he will shew the interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then was <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> brought in before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> spake and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, Art thou that <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, which art of the children of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> my father brought out of Jewry?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have even heard of thee, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And now the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, and have a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> about thy <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> answered and said before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and make known to him the interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> O thou <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, the most high God gave <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and honour:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and they took his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> from him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> like oxen, and his body was wet with the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And thou his son, O <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a>, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> in them; and thou hast praised the gods of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> was written.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> that was written, <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#002">MENE</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#002">MENE</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd360.htm#002">TEKEL</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#009">UPHARSIN</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> This is the interpretation of the thing: <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#002">MENE</a>; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd360.htm#002">TEKEL</a>; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#008">PERES</a>; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a>, and they clothed <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, and put a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> about his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> In that night was <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the Chaldeans slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.<br>
