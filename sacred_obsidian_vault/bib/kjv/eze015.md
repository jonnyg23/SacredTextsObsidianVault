 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, what is the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> tree more than any tree, or than a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> which is among the trees of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Shall <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Behold, it is cast into the fire for <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</a>; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> tree among the trees of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, which I have given to the fire for <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</a>, so will I give the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
