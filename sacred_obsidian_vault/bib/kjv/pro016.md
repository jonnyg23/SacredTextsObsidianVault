 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> All the ways of a man are <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Every one that is proud in heart is an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> By <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Better is a little with <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> than great revenues without right.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> A divine sentence is in the lips of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> A just weight and <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a> are the LORD's: all the <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#006">weights</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</a> are his work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> It is an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to kings to commit wickedness: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> is established by <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The wrath of a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> is as messengers of death: but a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man will pacify it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> of the latter <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> How much better is it to get wisdom than <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>! and to get understanding rather to be <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> than <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a> of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Pride goeth before <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, and an haughty <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> before a fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Better it is to be of an humble <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The heart of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The hoary head is a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, if it be found in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> He that is slow to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> than he that taketh a city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.<br>
