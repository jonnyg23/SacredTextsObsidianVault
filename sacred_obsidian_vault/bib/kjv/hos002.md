 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Say ye unto your brethren, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#005">Ammi</a>; and to your sisters, <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#005">Ruhamah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Lest I strip her <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I will not have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For their mother hath played the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and my water, my <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a> and my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a>, mine oil and my <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For she did not know that I gave her <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and oil, and multiplied her <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, which they prepared for <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Therefore will I return, and take away my <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> in the time thereof, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> in the season thereof, and will recover my <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a> and my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a> given to cover her nakedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And now will I discover her <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</a> in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will destroy her vines and her <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I will visit upon her the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>, wherein she burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to them, and she decked herself with her <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a> and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and speak comfortably unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</a> for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#004">Ishi</a>; and shalt call me no more <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#006">Baali</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For I will take away the names of <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a> out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And in that day will I make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#005">betroth</a> thee unto me for ever; yea, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#005">betroth</a> thee unto me in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I will even <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#005">betroth</a> thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the earth shall hear the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and the oil; and they shall hear <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon her that had not obtained <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.<br>
