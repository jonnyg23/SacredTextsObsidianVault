 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, out of their graves:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they shall spread them before the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a> upon the face of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And death shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Why then is this people of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> deceit, they refuse to return.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#007">stork</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#002">crane</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> How do ye say, We are <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> is in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> even unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> every one dealeth falsely.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Were they ashamed when they had committed <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, nor figs on the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</a> shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, because we have sinned against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The snorting of his horses was heard from <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>? is not her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in her? Why have they provoked me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their graven images, and with strange vanities?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Is there no <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#009">balm</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>; is there no <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</a> there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?<br>
