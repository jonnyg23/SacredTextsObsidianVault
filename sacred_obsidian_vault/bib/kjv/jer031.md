 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and they shall be my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> found <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; even <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when I went to cause him to rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> unto the LORD our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> is my firstborn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> will gather him, and keep him, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> doth his flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the LORD hath redeemed <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and shall flow together to the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> of the LORD, for <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a>: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> rejoice in the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</a>, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I have surely heard <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> unaccustomed to the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a>: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Is <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> are troubled for him; I will surely have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon him, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a>, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, turn again to these thy cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>; The LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>, and mountain of <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And there shall dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> with the seed of man, and with the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</a>, and the children's teeth are set on edge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</a>, his teeth shall be set on edge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and with the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Not according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; which my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> But this shall be the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that I will make with the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> for a light by day, and the ordinances of the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Thus saith the LORD; If <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for all that they have done, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#002">Hananeel</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the corner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#002">Gareb</a>, and shall compass about to <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#002">Goath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the dead bodies, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>, and all the fields unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>, unto the corner of the horse <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.<br>
