 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass on the second <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> after the first, that he went through the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass also on another <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, that he entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> watched him, whether he would heal on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day; that they might find an accusation against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they were filled with <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</a>; and communed one with another what they might do to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> to God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, (whom he also named <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>,) and <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a> his brother, <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> and John, <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#009">Bartholomew</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#003">Matthew</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#005">Alphaeus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#003">Zelotes</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a>, which also was the traitor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he came down with them, and stood in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and from the sea coast of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: for yours is the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> and weep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> them that <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And unto him that smiteth thee on the one <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</a> offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#009">cloak</a> forbid not to take thy <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?  for sinners also do even the same.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And he spake a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> unto them, Can the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> lead the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>? shall they not both fall into the ditch?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And why beholdest thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#004">mote</a> that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</a> that is in thine own eye?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#004">mote</a> that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</a> that is in thine own eye? Thou <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a>, cast out first the <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</a> out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#004">mote</a> that is in thy brother's eye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> For every tree is known by his own <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#001">bramble</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</a> gather they grapes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> He is like a man which built an house, and digged <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>, and laid the foundation on a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>: and when the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.<br>
