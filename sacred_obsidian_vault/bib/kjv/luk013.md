 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He spake also this <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>; A certain man had a <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereon, and found none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> on this <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a> it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And if it bear <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And, behold, there was a woman which had a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> lift up herself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the ruler of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> answered with indignation, because that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had healed on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a>, doth not each one of you on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> loose his <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> or his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> from the stall, and lead him away to watering?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And ought not this woman, being a daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> It is like a <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#009">mustard</a> seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> It is like <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a>, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he went through the cities and <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a>, teaching, and journeying toward <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Strive to enter in at the strait <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#008">knock</a> at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And they shall come from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The same day there came certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#003">fox</a>, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> perish out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#002">hen</a> doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br>
