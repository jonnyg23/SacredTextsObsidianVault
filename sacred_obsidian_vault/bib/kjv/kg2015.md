 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the twenty and seventh year of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> began <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> son of <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to reign.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> had done;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> still on the high places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the LORD smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> In the thirty and eighth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> did <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#005">Zachariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> six months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, who made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a> conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#005">Zachariah</a>, behold, they are written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a>, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto the fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>. And so it came to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a> began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and he reigned a full month in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a>, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> smote <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#007">Tiphsah</a>, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> In the nine and thirtieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> began <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> the son of Gadi to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and reigned ten years in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, who made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#002">Pul</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> came against the land: and <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> gave <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#002">Pul</a> a thousand talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> exacted the money of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, to give to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> turned back, and stayed not there in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> slept with his fathers; and <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#003">Pekahiah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> In the fiftieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#003">Pekahiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#001">Menahem</a> began to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and reigned two years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, who made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#002">Pekah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#003">Remaliah</a>, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the king's house, with <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#003">Argob</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#004">Arieh</a>, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.<br>
