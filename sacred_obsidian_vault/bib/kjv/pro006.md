 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> My son, if thou be <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Deliver thyself as a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#002">roe</a> from the hand of the hunter, and as a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> from the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#002">fowler</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Go to the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#009">ant</a>, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> are an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> unto him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For the commandment is a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a>; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">Lust</a> not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Can a man take fire in his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and his clothes not be burned?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But whoso committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a> with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> He will not regard any <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a>; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.<br>
