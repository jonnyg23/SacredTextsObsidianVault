 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 John Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Whosoever believeth that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> is the Son of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> This is he that came by water and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; not by water only, but by water and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>. And it is the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> that beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> is truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For there are three that bear record in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, the Father, the Word, and the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>: and these three are one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there are three that bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> in earth, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, and the water, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: and these three agree in one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If we receive the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of men, the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of God is greater: for this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of God which he hath testified of his Son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> If any man see his brother <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> not unto death. There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> All unrighteousness is <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: and there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> not unto death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>. This is the true God, and eternal life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Little children, keep yourselves from idols. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
