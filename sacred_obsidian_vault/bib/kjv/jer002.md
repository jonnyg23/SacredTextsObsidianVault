 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Go and cry in the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, in a land that was not sown.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a> unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and all the families of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, that led us through the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</a>, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof and the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and walked after things that do not profit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For pass over the isles of <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#003">Chittim</a>, and see; and send unto <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</a>, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> for that which doth not profit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Is <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> a servant? is he a homeborn <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#003">slave</a>? why is he spoiled?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Also the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#005">Tahapanes</a> have broken the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of thy head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And now what hast thou to do in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#003">Sihor</a>? or what hast thou to do in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the waters of the river?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For of old time I have broken thy <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a>, and burst thy <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Yet I had planted thee a noble <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> unto me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For though thou wash thee with <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#009">nitre</a>, and take thee much <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#002">soap</a>, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>?  see thy way in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#002">dromedary</a> traversing her ways;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> A wild <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> used to the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? a land of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Also in thy skirts is found the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the souls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, as thou wast ashamed of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.<br>
