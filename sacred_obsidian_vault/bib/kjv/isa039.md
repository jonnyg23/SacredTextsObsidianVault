 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 39</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#004">Baladan</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, sent letters and a present to <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, and the precious <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>, and all the house of his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> shewed them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then came <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a>, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.<br>
