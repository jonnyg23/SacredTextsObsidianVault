 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> drew nigh that he should die; and he charged <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> his son, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Moreover thou knowest also what <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a> did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#007">Jether</a>, whom he slew, and shed the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of war in peace, and put the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of war upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But shew kindness unto the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</a> the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> thy brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And, behold, thou hast with thee <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#003">Gera</a>, a Benjamite of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#009">Bahurim</a>, which cursed me with a grievous <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> in the day when I went to <a href="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</a>: but he came down to meet me at <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the days that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> reigned over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were forty years: <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years reigned he in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, and thirty and three years reigned he in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then sat <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#009">Haggith</a> came to Bathsheba the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#004">Abishag</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#000">Shunammite</a> to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Bathsheba therefore went unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, to speak unto him for <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And she said, Let <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#004">Abishag</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#000">Shunammite</a> be given to <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a> thy brother to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#004">Abishag</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#000">Shunammite</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a>? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> brother; even for him, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a> have not spoken this word against his own life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a> shall be put to death this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> sent by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a>; and he fell upon him that he died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> said the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Get thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</a>, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD God before <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> thrust out <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> from being <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then tidings came to <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>: for <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> had turned after <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a>, though he turned not after <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> fled unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> was fled unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> sent <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a>, saying, Go, fall upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> brought the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> word again, saying, Thus said <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and thus he answered me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> shed, from me, and from the house of my father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the LORD shall return his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, my father <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> not knowing thereof, to wit, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a>, captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#007">Jether</a>, captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall therefore return upon the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> put <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> in his room over the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> did the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> put in the room of <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent and called for <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>, and said unto him, Build thee an house in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon thine own head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, The saying is good: as my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath said, so will thy servant do. And <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> ran away unto <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> son of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>. And they told <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>, saying, Behold, thy servants be in <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> arose, and saddled his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> to seek his servants: and <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> went, and brought his servants from <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> had gone from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, and was come again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent and called for <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Why then hast thou not kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said moreover to <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> shall be blessed, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> shall be established before the LORD for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a>; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
