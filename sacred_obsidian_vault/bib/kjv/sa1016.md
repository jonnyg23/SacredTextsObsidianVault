 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, How long wilt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? fill thine <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> with oil, and go, I will send thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> among his sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said, How can I go? if <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a> with thee, and say, I am come to <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And call <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> unto me him whom I name unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> did that which the LORD spake, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>. And he sanctified <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> and his sons, and called them to the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#008">Eliab</a>, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</a>, and made him pass before <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>. And he said, Neither hath the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#002">Shammah</a> to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Again, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> of his sons to pass before <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, The LORD hath not <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> him: for this is he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> took the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD came upon <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> from that day forward. So <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> rose up, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and an evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> from the LORD troubled him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> from God troubleth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>: and it shall come to pass, when the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent messengers unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, and said, Send me <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy son, which is with the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a> took an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> laden with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and a kid, and sent them by <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his son unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, saying, Let <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass, when the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> from God was upon <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> took an <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>, and played with his hand: so <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was refreshed, and was well, and the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> departed from him.<br>
