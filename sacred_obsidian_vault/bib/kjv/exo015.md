 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then sang <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: he is my God, and I will prepare him an <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>; my father's God, and I will exalt him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Pharaoh's chariots and his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> hath he cast into the sea: his <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> captains also are drowned in the Red sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a> shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, my hand shall destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>, fearful in praises, doing wonders?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then the dukes of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> shall be amazed; the mighty men of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> shall melt away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">Sanctuary</a>, O LORD, which thy hands have established.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the horse of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went on dry land in the midst of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#003">Miriam</a> the prophetess, the sister of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, took a <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#004">timbrel</a> in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#003">Miriam</a> answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> brought <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from the Red sea, and they went out into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#002">Shur</a>; and they went three days in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and found no water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#003">Marah</a>, they could not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#003">Marah</a>, for they were <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>: therefore the name of it was called <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#003">Marah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the people murmured against <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying, What shall we <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#001">Elim</a>, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.<br>
