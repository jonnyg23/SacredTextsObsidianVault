 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> with words?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> in my paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He hath stripped me of my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and taken the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> from my head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</a> round about my <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>: I am an <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#003">alien</a> in their sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> That they were graven with an <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> pen and lead in the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> for ever!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For I know that my <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a> liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall I see God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a> be consumed within me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Be ye afraid of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, that ye may know there is a judgment.<br>
