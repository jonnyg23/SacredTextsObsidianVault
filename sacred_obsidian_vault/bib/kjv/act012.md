 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now about that time Herod the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he killed <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the brother of John with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> also. (Then were the days of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when he had apprehended him, he put him in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#005">Easter</a> to bring him forth to the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> therefore was kept in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>: and he smote <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#006">sandals</a>. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>; but thought he saw a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When they were past the first and the second <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a>, they came unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> departed from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a>, that the LORD hath sent his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> knocked at the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, a damsel came to hearken, named <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#000">Rhoda</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> for gladness, but ran in, and told how <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>. And he said, Go shew these things unto <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>, and there abode.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And Herod was highly displeased with them of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#006">Blastus</a> the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</a> their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, sat upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and made an oration unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And immediately the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But the word of God grew and multiplied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> returned from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.<br>
