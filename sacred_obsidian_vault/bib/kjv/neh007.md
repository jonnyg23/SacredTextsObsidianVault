 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,<br>
