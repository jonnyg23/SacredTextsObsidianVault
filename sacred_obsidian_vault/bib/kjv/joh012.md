 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> six days before the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a>, where <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> There they made him a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a> served: but <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> was one of them that sat at the table with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then took <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#008">pound</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#008">spikenard</a>, very costly, and anointed the feet of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then saith one of his disciples, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a>, Simon's son, which should betray him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Why was not this <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> sold for three hundred pence, and given to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> This he said, not that he cared for the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>; but because he was a thief, and had the <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</a>, and bare what was put therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> also, whom he had raised from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But the chief priests consulted that they might put <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> also to death;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> On the next day much people that were come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, when they heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was coming to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#001">Hosanna</a>: Blessed is the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, when he had found a young <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, sat thereon; as it is written,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Fear not, daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</a>: behold, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> cometh, <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> on an ass's colt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The people therefore that was with him when he called <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, and raised him from the dead, bare record.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> at the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The same came therefore to <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, which was of <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> cometh and telleth <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a>: and again <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> tell <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Father, <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> thy name. Then came there a voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, saying, I have both glorified it, and will <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> it again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> spake to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of this world be cast out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> This he said, signifying what death he should die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> come upon you: for he that walketh in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> knoweth not whither he goeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and departed, and did hide himself from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> That the saying of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Therefore they could not believe, because that <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> said again,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> These things said <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a>, when he saw his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and spake of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> him not: for I came not to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the world, but to save the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> him in the last day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And I know that his commandment is life <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.<br>
