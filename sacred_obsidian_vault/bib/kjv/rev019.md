 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">Salvation</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and hath avenged the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of his servants at her hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And again they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</a> And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And a voice came out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</a>: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> and white: for the fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> is the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of saints.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I fell at his feet to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> God: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I saw <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">Faithful</a> and True, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> he doth <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> and make war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: and his name is called The Word of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the armies which were in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, white and <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And out of his mouth goeth a sharp <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</a> OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I saw an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> standing in the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, Come and gather yourselves together unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</a> of the great God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> That ye may eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of kings, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of captains, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of mighty men, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of all men, both free and <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a>, both small and great.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> was taken, and with him the false <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the remnant were slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of him that sat upon the horse, which <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
