 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 109</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They compassed me about also with words of <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a>; and fought against me without a cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a> for my love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> stand at his right hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> become <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Let his days be few; and let another take his office.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#001">beg</a>: let them seek their <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> also out of their desolate places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Let there be none to extend <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> following let their name be blotted out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of his mother be blotted out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Because that he remembered not to shew <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, but persecuted the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> like water, and like oil into his bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> wherewith he is girded continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> is good, deliver thou me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I am <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I am gone like the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> My knees are weak through fasting; and my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> faileth of fatness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Let them <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, but <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For he shall stand at the right hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, to save him from those that condemn his soul.<br>
