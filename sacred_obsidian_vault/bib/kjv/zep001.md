 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Zephaniah Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word of the LORD which came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#008">Zephaniah</a> the son of Cushi, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#002">Amariah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#008">Hizkiah</a>, in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I will consume man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>; I will consume the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I will also stretch out mine hand upon <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and upon all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and I will cut off the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a> from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And them that <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> upon the housetops; and them that <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, he hath bid his guests.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</a>, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Howl, ye inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#007">Maktesh</a>, for all the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#003">merchant</a> people are cut down; all they that bear <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> are cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#005">lees</a>: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore their goods shall become a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#006">booty</a>, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A day of the trumpet and <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</a> against the fenced cities, and against the high <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be poured out as <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Neither their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> nor their <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a>: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.<br>
