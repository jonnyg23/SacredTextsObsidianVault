 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Hear ye the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and speak unto the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and to the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That I may perform the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, Hear ye the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and do them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and among the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> have broken my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which I made with their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then shall the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and according to the number of the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</a> with many, and the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The LORD called thy name, A green <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, fair, and of goodly <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But I was like a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> or an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a> and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</a>, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; their sons and their daughters shall die by <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</a>, even the year of their visitation.<br>
