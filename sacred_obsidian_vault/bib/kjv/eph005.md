 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And walk in love, as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to God for a sweetsmelling savour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and all uncleanness, or <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> and of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For ye were sometimes <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> (For the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> is in all <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and truth;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And have no <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> with the unfruitful works of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, but rather reprove them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> shall give thee light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And be not <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, wherein is excess; but be filled with the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Speaking to yourselves in <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</a> and hymns and spiritual <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</a>, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is the head of the church: and he is the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</a> of the body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore as the church is subject unto <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Husbands, love your wives, even as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> also loved the church, and gave himself for it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</a> of water by the word,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For no man ever yet hated his own <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For we are members of his body, of his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and of his bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> This is a great <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a>: but I speak concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> and the church.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.<br>
