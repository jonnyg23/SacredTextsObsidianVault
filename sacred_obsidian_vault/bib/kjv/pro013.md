 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A man shall eat good by the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">Righteousness</a> keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, yet hath great riches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a> of a man's life are his riches: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> heareth not rebuke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a> of the wicked shall be put out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The law of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> is a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> A wicked <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> falleth into mischief: but a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#008">ambassador</a> is health.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to fools to depart from evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that walketh with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Much food is in the tillage of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> of the wicked shall want.<br>
