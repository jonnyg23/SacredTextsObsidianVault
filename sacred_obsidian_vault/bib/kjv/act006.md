 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#003">murmuring</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#002">Grecians</a> against the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>, because their <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> were neglected in the daily ministration.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> men of honest report, full of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But we will give ourselves continually to <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, and to the ministry of the word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a>, a man full of faith and of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, and Prochorus, and <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#004">Nicanor</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#000">Timon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#004">Parmenas</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#007">Nicolas</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#001">proselyte</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a>, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then there arose certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, which is called the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, disputing with <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> by which he spake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and against God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For we have heard him say, that this <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a> shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> delivered us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And all that sat in the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>.<br>
