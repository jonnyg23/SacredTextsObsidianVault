 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 John Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> with us: and truly our <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> is with the Father, and with his Son <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If we say that we have <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> with him, and walk in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, we lie, and do not the truth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> one with another, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> his Son cleanseth us from all <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If we say that we have no <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If we confess our sins, he is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.<br>
