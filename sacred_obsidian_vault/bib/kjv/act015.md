 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, ye cannot be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> When therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, and certain other of them, should go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto the apostles and elders about this question.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#001">Phenice</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, declaring the <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#002">conversion</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when they were come to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But there rose up certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when there had been much disputing, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> by my mouth should hear the word of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, and believe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, giving them the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, even as he did unto us;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a> of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But we believe that through the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> we shall be saved, even as they.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> by them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And after they had held their peace, <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> hath declared how God at the first did visit the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, to take out of them a people for his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> After this I will return, and will build again the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> are turned to God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and from things strangled, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> men of their own company to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>; namely, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> surnamed <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#008">Barsabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>, chief men among the brethren:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> men unto you with our beloved <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> We have sent therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For it seemed good to the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and to us, to lay upon you no greater <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> than these necessary things;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and from things strangled, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> So when they were dismissed, they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Notwithstanding it pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a> to abide there still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> also and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> continued in <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And some days after <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</a>, and went not with them to the work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> took Mark, and sailed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> chose <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</a>, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And he went through <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a>, confirming the churches.<br>
