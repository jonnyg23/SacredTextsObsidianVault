 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thou shalt not <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto the LORD thy God any <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, wherein is <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> unto the LORD thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, or any of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, which I have not commanded;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> is wrought in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> them with stones, till they die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> he shall not be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> that standeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> there before the LORD thy God, or unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over me, like as all the nations that are about me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thou shalt in any <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> set him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over thee: thou mayest not set a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> over thee, which is not thy brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
