 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 41</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Blessed is he that considereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, hath lifted up his heel against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Blessed be the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
