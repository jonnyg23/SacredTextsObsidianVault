 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 48</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Against <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Woe unto <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#004">Nebo</a>! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#005">Misgab</a> is confounded and dismayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> There shall be no more praise of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>: in <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a> they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#000">Madmen</a>; the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall pursue thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A voice of crying shall be from <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#005">Horonaim</a>, spoiling and great <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For in the going up of <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#001">Luhith</a> continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#005">Horonaim</a> the enemies have heard a cry of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Flee, save your lives, and be like the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#004">heath</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a> shall go forth into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> with his priests and his princes together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> also shall perish, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Give wings unto <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#005">lees</a>, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> shall be ashamed of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a>, as the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was ashamed of <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> their confidence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>, whose name is the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The calamity of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> is near to come, and his affliction hasteth <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thou daughter that dost inhabit <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#005">Dibon</a>, come down from thy <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> O inhabitant of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#001">Aroer</a>, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> is spoiled,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And judgment is come upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#005">Mephaath</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And upon <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#005">Dibon</a>, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#004">Nebo</a>, and upon Bethdiblathaim,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And upon <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#008">Kerioth</a>, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</a>, and upon all the cities of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, far or near.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For was not <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves?  for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> O ye that dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, leave the cities, and dwell in the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and be like the <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a> that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> We have heard the pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Therefore will I howl for <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and I will cry out for all <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>; mine heart shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> for the men of Kirheres.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#006">Sibmah</a>, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and I have caused <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> From the cry of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#009">Elealeh</a>, and even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#005">Jahaz</a>, have they uttered their voice, from <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#004">Zoar</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#005">Horonaim</a>, as an <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a> of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Moreover I will cause to cease in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to his gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Therefore mine heart shall sound for <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For every head shall be bald, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</a> clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> There shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a> generally upon all the housetops of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> turned the back with shame! so shall <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> as an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a>, and shall spread his wings over <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#008">Kerioth</a> is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Fear, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>; and he that getteth up out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> shall be taken in the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>: for I will bring upon it, even upon <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> They that fled stood under the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a> because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a>, and a flame from the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a>, and shall devour the corner of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of the head of the tumultuous ones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Woe be unto thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>! the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a> perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Yet will I bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>.<br>
