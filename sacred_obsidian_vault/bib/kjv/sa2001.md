 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had abode two days in <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#003">Ziklag</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> with his clothes <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that he fell to the earth, and did <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> am I escaped.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son are dead also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son be dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#000">Amalekite</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> that was upon his head, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#000">bracelet</a> that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> took hold on his clothes, and <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> them; and likewise all the men that were with him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; because they were fallen by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#000">Amalekite</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto him, Thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> lamented with this <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> (Also he bade them teach the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> the use of the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>: behold, it is written in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#009">Jasher</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The beauty of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Tell it not in <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Ye mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>, let there be no <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a>, neither let there be <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> of the mighty is vilely cast away, the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, as though he had not been anointed with oil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> From the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the slain, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of the mighty, the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> turned not back, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> returned not empty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Ye daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, weep over <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, who clothed you in <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, with other delights, who put on ornaments of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> upon your <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, thou wast slain in thine high places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I am distressed for thee, my brother <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!<br>
