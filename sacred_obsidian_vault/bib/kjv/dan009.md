 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>, of the seed of the Medes, which was made <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over the realm of the Chaldeans;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> In the first year of his reign I <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and supplications, with fasting, and <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#003">confession</a>, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> O LORD, <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and to the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and unto all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Yea, all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> is poured upon us, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> that is written in the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> hath not been done as hath been done upon <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> As it is written in the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> O LORD, according to all thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, I beseech thee, let thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> be turned away from thy city <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now therefore, O our God, hear the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> O my God, incline thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Yea, whiles I was speaking in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, even the man <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</a>, whom I had seen in the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> at the beginning, being caused to <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#004">reconciliation</a> for iniquity, and to bring in <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> up the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> the most Holy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#006">Messiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</a> shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And after threescore and two weeks shall <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#006">Messiah</a> be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> that shall come shall destroy the city and the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>; and the end thereof shall be with a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he shall confirm the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.<br>
