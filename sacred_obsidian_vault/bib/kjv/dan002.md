 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And in the second year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> dreamed dreams, wherewith his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded to call the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a>, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> his dreams. So they came and stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto them, I have dreamed a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was troubled to know the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then spake the Chaldeans to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in Syriack, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, live for ever: tell thy servants the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and we will shew the interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But if ye shew the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and the interpretation thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They answered again and said, Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> tell his servants the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and we will shew the interpretation of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But if ye will not make known unto me the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The Chaldeans answered before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#006">astrologer</a>, or Chaldean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it is a rare thing that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For this cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the decree went forth that the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men should be slain; and they sought <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> and his fellows to be slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> answered with counsel and wisdom to <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</a> the captain of the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, which was gone forth to slay the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He answered and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</a> the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>? Then <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</a> made the thing known to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> went in, and desired of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that he would give him time, and that he would shew the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> the interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> went to his house, and made the thing known to <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>, his companions:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> That they would desire mercies of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> concerning this secret; that <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then was the secret revealed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> in a night <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> blessed the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he changeth the times and the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</a>: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and knowledge to them that know understanding:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He revealeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> and secret things: he knoweth what is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and the light dwelleth with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> went in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had ordained to destroy the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: bring me in before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and I will shew unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> the interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</a> brought in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that will make known unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> the interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#002">Belteshazzar</a>, Art thou able to make known unto me the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> answered in the presence of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said, The secret which the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath demanded cannot the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, the astrologers, the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a>, the soothsayers, shew unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But there is a God in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> what shall be in the latter days. Thy <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> As for thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Thou, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> This image's head was of fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, his breast and his arms of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> and his thighs of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> His legs of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, his feet part of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> and part of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Thou sawest till that a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, and brake them to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then was the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, broken to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> together, and became like the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Thou, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, art a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of kings: for the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, which shall bear rule over all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>: forasmuch as <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> breaketh in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> and subdueth all things: and as <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> that breaketh all these, shall it break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> and bruise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, and part of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, forasmuch as thou sawest the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> mixed with miry <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And as the toes of the feet were part of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and part of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And whereas thou sawest <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> mixed with miry <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> is not mixed with <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And in the days of these kings shall the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; the great God hath made known to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> what shall come to pass hereafter: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> fell upon his face, and worshipped <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and chief of the governors over all the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> requested of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and he set <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#003">Shadrach</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd250.htm#007">Meshach</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#003">Abednego</a>, over the affairs of the province of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> sat in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
