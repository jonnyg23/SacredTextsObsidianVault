 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Again, thou shalt say to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Whosoever he be of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, or of the strangers that sojourn in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> him with stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, and to profane my holy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the man that committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a> with another man's wife, even he that committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a> with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>: they shall surely be put to death; their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And if a man lie with a <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And if a woman approach unto any <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>: they shall surely be put to death; their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a>, and she hath uncovered the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of her <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; they shall die childless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Ye shall therefore put difference between <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> A man also or woman that hath a familiar <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, or that is a <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#000">wizard</a>, shall surely be put to death: they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> them with stones: their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be upon them.<br>
