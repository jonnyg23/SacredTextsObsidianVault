 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> also in the time of trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> with judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The earth mourneth and languisheth: <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> is ashamed and hewn down: <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#009">Sharon</a> is like a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a> shake off their fruits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Ye shall conceive <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a>, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the people shall be as the burnings of <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#006">lime</a>: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The sinners in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> burnings?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thine eyes shall see the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Look upon <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> a quiet <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For the LORD is our <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; he will save us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.<br>
