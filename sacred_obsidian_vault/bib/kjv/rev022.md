 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#005">crystal</a>, proceeding out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of God and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And there shall be no more <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of God and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And there shall be no night there; and they need no <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a>, neither light of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said unto me, These sayings are <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> of this book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> before the feet of the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which shewed me these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he saith unto me, <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">Seal</a> not the sayings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> of this book: for the time is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I am Alpha and <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#004">Omega</a>, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> have sent mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and the bright and morning star.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>. Even so, come, Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be with you all. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
