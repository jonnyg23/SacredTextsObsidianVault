 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He sitteth in the lurking places of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a>: in the secret places doth he <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</a> the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a>: he lieth in wait to catch the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: he doth catch the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, when he draweth him into his <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> may fall by his strong ones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The LORD is <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> for ever and ever: the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> are perished out of his land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to hear:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> To <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.<br>
