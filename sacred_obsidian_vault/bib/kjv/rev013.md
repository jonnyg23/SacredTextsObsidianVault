 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> rise up out of the sea, having <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> which I saw was like unto a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</a>, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they worshipped the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> which gave power unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>: and they worshipped the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, saying, Who is like unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>? who is able to make war with him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he opened his mouth in <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a> against God, to blaspheme his name, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, and them that dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And all that dwell upon the earth shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> slain from the foundation of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If any man have an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He that leadeth into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> shall go into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>: he that killeth with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> must be killed with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I beheld another <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a>, and he spake as a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he exerciseth all the power of the first <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the first <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> on the earth in the sight of men,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, which had the wound by a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and did live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he had power to give life unto the image of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, that the image of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> should both speak, and cause that as many as would not <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the image of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> should be killed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, free and <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a>, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, or the number of his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.<br>
