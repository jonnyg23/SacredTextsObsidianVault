 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD is my strength and my <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Save thy people, and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.<br>
