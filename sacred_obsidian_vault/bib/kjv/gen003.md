 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> was more subtil than any <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the woman said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, We may eat of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the trees of the garden:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, she took of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>; and they sewed <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> leaves together, and made themselves aprons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD God called unto <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a>, and said unto him, Where art thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>; and I hid myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> beguiled me, and I did eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the LORD God said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and above every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the field; upon thy <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> shalt thou go, and <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will put <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a> between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> of the field;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> thou art, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> shalt thou return.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> called his wife's name <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#005">Eve</a>; because she was the mother of all living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Unto <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>, to till the ground from whence he was taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> of the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a> Cherubims, and a flaming <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br>
