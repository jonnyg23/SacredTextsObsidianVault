 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 65</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A people that provoketh me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> continually to my face; that sacrificeth in <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a>, and burneth <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> upon altars of brick;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Which remain among the graves, and <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in the monuments, which eat swine's <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Thus saith the LORD, As the new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will bring forth a seed out of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and out of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#009">Sharon</a> shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</a> of flocks, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</a> a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto that number.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore will I number you to the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and ye shall all <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And ye shall leave your name for a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> unto my <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> a rejoicing, and her people a joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will rejoice in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> shall feed together, and the lion shall eat <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</a> like the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.<br>
