 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#005">affinity</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father: only he sacrificed and burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> in high places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went to <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> offer upon that <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> In <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a> the LORD appeared to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father great <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, as it is this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> this thy so great a people?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the speech pleased the LORD, that <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had asked this thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> awoke; and, behold, it was a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>. And he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> to all his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and stood before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> with us in the house, save we two in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> slept, and laid it in her <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and laid her dead child in my <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then said the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Bring me a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>. And they brought a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, for her <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> slay it: she is the mother thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> heard of the judgment which the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had judged; and they feared the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.<br>
