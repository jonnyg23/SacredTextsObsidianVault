 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 57</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, thou hast offered a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>. Should I receive comfort in these?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behind the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And thou wentest to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>, and didst increase thy <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#002">perfumes</a>, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I will declare thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, to revive the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the iniquity of his <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a> was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> I create the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.<br>
