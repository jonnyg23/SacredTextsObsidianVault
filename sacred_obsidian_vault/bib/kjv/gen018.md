 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>: and he sat in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> door in the heat of the day;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> door, and bowed himself toward the ground,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I will fetch a morsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> hastened into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a>, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#005">knead</a> it, and make cakes upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> ran unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a>, and fetcht a <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a> tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he took <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a> which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they said unto him, Where is <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> thy wife shall have a son. And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> heard it in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> door, which was behind him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> after the manner of women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, Wherefore did <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> laugh, saying, Shall I of a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> bear a child, which am old?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> shall have a son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> went with them to bring them on the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> that thing which I do;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Seeing that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> that which he hath spoken of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the LORD said, Because the cry of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a> is great, and because their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is very grievous;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> stood yet before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> of all the earth do right?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the LORD said, If I find in <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> returned unto his place.<br>
