 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Micah Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; they hunt every man his brother with a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> asketh, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The best of them is as a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#003">brier</a>: the most upright is sharper than a <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</a> hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: my God will hear me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, the LORD shall be a light unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> In that day also he shall come even to thee from <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of their doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>: let them feed in <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, as in the days of old.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> According to the days of thy coming out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> will I shew unto him marvellous things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They shall lick the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> like a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> for ever, because he delighteth in <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou wilt perform the truth to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.<br>
