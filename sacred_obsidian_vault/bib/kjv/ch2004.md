 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover he made an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#006">cubit</a>, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the thickness of it was an <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#006">handbreadth</a>, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a> of lilies; and it received and held three thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd047.htm#004">baths</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he made ten candlesticks of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> according to their form, and set them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, five on the right hand, and five on the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He made also ten <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a>, and placed them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> for the court, and overlaid the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of them with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he set the sea on the right side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> end, over against the south.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> for the house of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> To wit, the two pillars, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#001">pommels</a>, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#001">pommels</a> of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#001">pommels</a> of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> One sea, and twelve oxen under it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> for the house of the LORD of bright <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> In the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> did the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> cast them, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a> ground between <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#004">Zeredathah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thus <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> could not be found out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> also, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> whereon the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a> was set;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>, of pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a>, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and that perfect <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: and the entry of the house, the inner <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> thereof for the most holy place, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, were of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
