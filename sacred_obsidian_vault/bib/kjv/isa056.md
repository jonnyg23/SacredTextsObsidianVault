 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 56</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>: for my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> is near to come, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> to be revealed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Neither let the son of the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a> say, Behold, I am a dry tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> name, that shall not be cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Also the sons of the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> from polluting it, and taketh hold of my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>; for mine house shall be called an house of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> for all people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> His watchmen are <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>: they are all ignorant, they are all <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Come ye, say they, I will fetch <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and we will fill ourselves with strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.<br>
