 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> like unto the first, and come up unto me into the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and make thee an <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I will write on the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> the words that were in the first <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I made an <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#009">shittim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and hewed two <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> like unto the first, and went up into the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, having the two <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> in mine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he wrote on the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a>, according to the first <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I turned myself and came down from the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and put the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> took their <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#006">Beeroth</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#003">Jaakan</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#001">Mosera</a>: there <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> died, and there he was buried; and <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> At that time the LORD separated the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, to bear the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto him, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> in his name, unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a> hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I stayed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And now, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, in giving him food and raiment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Love ye therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>: for ye were strangers in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thy fathers went down into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> for multitude.<br>
