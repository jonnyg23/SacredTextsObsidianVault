 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 68</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#003">JAH</a>, and rejoice before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> A father of the fatherless, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a>, is God in his holy <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a> itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thy <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> for the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a> covered with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and her feathers with yellow <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#005">Salmon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The hill of God is as the hill of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>; an high hill as the hill of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of angels: the Lord is among them, as in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, in the holy place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that is our God is the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The Lord said, I will bring again from <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> That thy foot may be dipped in the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> There is little <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> with their ruler, the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a>, and the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Because of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> shall kings bring presents unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: scatter thou the people that delight in war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Princes shall come out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a> shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and his strength is in the clouds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.<br>
