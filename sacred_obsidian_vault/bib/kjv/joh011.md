 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now a certain man was sick, named <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a>, the town of <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> and her sister <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> (It was that <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> which anointed the Lord with <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> was sick.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> loved <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a>, and her sister, and <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> thee; and goest thou thither again?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Howbeit <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them plainly, <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a> is dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</a>, which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#006">Didymus</a>, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came, he found that he had lain in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> four days already.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a> was nigh unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, about fifteen furlongs off:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And many of the Jews came to <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>, to comfort them concerning their brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a>, as soon as she heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was coming, went and met him: but <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> sat still in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a> saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of God, which should come into the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a> met him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> to weep there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then when <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> was come where <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and was troubled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, have caused that even this man should not have died?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>. It was a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> lay upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, Take ye away the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</a>, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Then they took away the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> from the place where the dead was laid. And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</a>, come forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#000">napkin</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then many of the Jews which came to <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>, and had seen the things which <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> did, believed on him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> But some of them went their ways to the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, and told them what things <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Then gathered the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And one of them, named <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a>, being the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And this spake he not of himself: but being high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> that year, he prophesied that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> should die for that nation;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, into a city called <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and there continued with his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And the Jews' <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, to purify themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Then sought they for <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, What think ye, that he will not come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> Now both the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.<br>
