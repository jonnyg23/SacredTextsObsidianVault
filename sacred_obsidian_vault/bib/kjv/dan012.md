 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And at that time shall <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</a> stand up, the great <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And many of them that sleep in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth shall awake, some to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life, and some to shame and <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> contempt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they that be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> shall shine as the brightness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</a>; and they that turn many to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But thou, O <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, shut up the words, and <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then I <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And one said to the man clothed in <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I heard the man clothed in <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said, Go thy way, <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> shall understand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And from the time that the daily <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> shall be taken away, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.<br>
