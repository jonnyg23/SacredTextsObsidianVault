 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 103</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> his holy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who redeemeth thy life from <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The LORD executeth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and judgment for all that are oppressed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He made known his ways unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, his acts unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and plenteous in <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He will not always chide: neither will he keep his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For as the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is high above the earth, so great is his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> toward them that fear him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> As far as the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As for man, his days are as <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> of the LORD is from <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> upon them that fear him, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto children's children;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> To such as keep his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The LORD hath prepared his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the LORD, O my soul.<br>
