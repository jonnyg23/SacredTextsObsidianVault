 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Let the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> also keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> at his appointed season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that they should keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>: according to all that the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, so did the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> on that day: and they came before <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and before <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> on that day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Speak unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> afar off, yet he shall keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> herbs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> they shall keep it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But the man that is <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and is not in a <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and forbeareth to keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> shall sojourn among you, and will keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, and for him that was born in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And on the day that the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> was reared up the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, namely, the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>: and at even there was upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So it was alway: the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> was taken up from the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, then after that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> journeyed: and in the place where the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> abode, there the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> pitched their tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> At the commandment of the LORD the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> abode upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> they rested in their tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> tarried long upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> many days, then the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And so it was, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> was a few days upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And so it was, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> abode from even unto the morning, and that the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> was taken up, they journeyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> tarried upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, remaining thereon, the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
