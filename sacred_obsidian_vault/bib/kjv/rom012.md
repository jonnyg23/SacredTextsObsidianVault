 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I say, through the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So we, being many, are one body in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and every one members one of another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Having then gifts differing according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> that is given to us, whether <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, with cheerfulness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Not slothful in business; fervent in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>; serving the Lord;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Rejoicing in hope; patient in <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>; continuing instant in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> them which persecute you: <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in your own conceits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>: for in so doing thou shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> coals of fire on his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.<br>
