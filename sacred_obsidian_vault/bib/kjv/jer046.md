 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 46</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word of the LORD which came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> against the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Against <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, against the army of Pharaohnecho <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, which was by the river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#005">Carchemish</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> smote in the fourth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Order ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>, and draw near to battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#007">Harness</a> the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Who is this that cometh up as a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, whose waters are moved as the rivers?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> riseth up like a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> with their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> in the north country by the river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Go up into <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, and take <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#009">balm</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The word that the LORD spake to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, how <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> should come and smite the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Declare ye in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and publish in <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#003">Migdol</a>, and publish in <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</a> and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and prepare thee; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall devour round about thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They did cry there, <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As I live, saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#007">Tabor</a> is among the mountains, and as <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a> by the sea, so shall he come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> O thou daughter dwelling in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, furnish thyself to go into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>: for <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</a> shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> is like a very fair <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a>, but <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> cometh; it cometh out of the north.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The voice thereof shall go like a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> They shall cut down her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, with their gods, and their kings; even <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and all them that trust in him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But fear not thou, O my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and be not dismayed, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Fear thou not, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.<br>
