 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there came one of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> angels which had the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> With whom the kings of the earth have committed <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> So he carried me away in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: and I saw a woman sit upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> coloured <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, full of names of <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>, having <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> heads and ten horns.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the woman was arrayed in purple and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a>, and decked with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and precious stones and pearls, having a golden <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And upon her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</a> was a name written, <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">MYSTERY</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">BABYLON</a> THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I saw the woman drunken with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the saints, and with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the martyrs of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> of the woman, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that carrieth her, which hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> heads and ten horns.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that was, and is not, and yet is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> heads are <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> mountains, on which the woman sitteth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And there are <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a>, and goeth into perdition.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> These shall make war with the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of kings: and they that are with him are called, and <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and shall eat her <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and burn her with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.<br>
