 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#006">Bildad</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#008">Shuhite</a>, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He teareth himself in his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> be removed out of his place?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The light shall be dark in his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a> shall be put out with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For he is cast into a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> by his own feet, and he walketh upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#004">gin</a> shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> His strength shall be hungerbitten, and <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> shall be ready at his side.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> His confidence shall be rooted out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, and it shall bring him to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of terrors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> It shall dwell in his <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, because it is none of his: <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a> shall be scattered upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> be cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He shall be driven from light into <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and chased out of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Surely such are the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a> of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.<br>
