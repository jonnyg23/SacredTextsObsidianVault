 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 50</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: their <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> their covering.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to hear as the learned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The Lord GOD hath opened mine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</a>, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a>? let him come near to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?  lo, they all shall <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> old as a garment; the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a> shall eat them up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.<br>
