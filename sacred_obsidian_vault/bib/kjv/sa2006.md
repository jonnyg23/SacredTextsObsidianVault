 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Again, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> gathered together all the <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, thirty thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, to bring up from thence the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they set the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God upon a new <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, and brought it out of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#001">Uzzah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#007">Ahio</a>, the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</a>, drave the new <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they brought it out of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</a> which was at <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>, accompanying the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God: and <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#007">Ahio</a> went before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#001">cymbals</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#001">Uzzah</a> put forth his hand to the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD was kindled against <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#001">Uzzah</a>; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was displeased, because the LORD had made a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> upon <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#001">Uzzah</a>: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD come to me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> would not remove the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD unto him into the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> carried it aside into the house of Obededom the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a> three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God. So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went and brought up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God from the house of Obededom into the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> with gladness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it was so, that when they that bare the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> danced before the LORD with all his might; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was girded with a <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> brought up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And as the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD came into the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they brought in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had pitched for it: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And as soon as <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had made an end of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as well to the women as men, to every one a <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and a good piece of <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#002">flagon</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>. So all the people departed every one to his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> his household. And <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> came out to meet <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and said, How glorious was the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a>, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: therefore will I play before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> had no child unto the day of her death.<br>
