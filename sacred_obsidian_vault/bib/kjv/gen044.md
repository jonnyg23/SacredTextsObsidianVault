 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 44</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And put my <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> money. And he did according to the word that <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> had spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> was found in Benjamin's sack.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then they <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> their clothes, and laded every man his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and returned to the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> is found.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> burn against thy servant: for thou art even as <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; and I saw him not since:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For thy servant became <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.<br>
