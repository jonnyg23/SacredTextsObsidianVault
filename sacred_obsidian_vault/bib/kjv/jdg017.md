 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there was a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the man <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> had an house of gods, and made an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</a>, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> In those days there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, who was a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a>, and he sojourned there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, as he journeyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and I will give thee ten shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> by the year, and a suit of <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and thy victuals. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> went in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> consecrated the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a>; and the young man became his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and was in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a>, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> to my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
