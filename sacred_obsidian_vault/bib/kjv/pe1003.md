 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> of the wives;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> While they behold your chaste <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> coupled with fear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, or of putting on of <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, which is in the sight of God of great price.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Even as Sara obeyed <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of life; that your prayers be not hindered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Let him <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#006">eschew</a> evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</a> and fear:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Having a good <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, but quickened by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, while the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, but the answer of a good <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> toward God,) by the resurrection of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Who is gone into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.<br>
