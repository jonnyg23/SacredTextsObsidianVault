 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD visited <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> as he had said, and the LORD did unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> as he had spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> conceived, and bare <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> bare to him, <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> circumcised his son <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> being eight days old, as God had commanded him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> was an hundred years old, when his son <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was born unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And she said, Who would have said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the child grew, and was weaned: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> made a great <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> the same day that <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was weaned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> saw the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> the Egyptian, which she had born unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, mocking.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Wherefore she said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> with my son, even with <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And God said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> shall thy seed be called.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> rose up early in the morning, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> of water, and gave it unto <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a>, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the water was spent in the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a>, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God called to <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and said unto her, What aileth thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a>? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> with water, and gave the lad <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and became an <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#002">archer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he dwelt in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#006">Paran</a>: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it came to pass at that time, that <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> and Phichol the chief captain of his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said, I will swear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> reproved <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> and oxen, and gave them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a>; and both of them made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> set <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, What mean these <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he said, For these <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto me, that I have digged this well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Wherefore he called that place <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>; because there they sware both of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Thus they made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>: then <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, and they returned into the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> planted a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>, and called there on the name of the LORD, the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.<br>
