 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the people cried unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>; and when <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he called the name of the place <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#001">Taberah</a>: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> also wept again, and said, Who shall give us <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to eat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> We remember the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a>, which we did eat in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> freely; the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#008">cucumbers</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd247.htm#007">melons</a>, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, before our eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> was as <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#001">coriander</a> seed, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> thereof as the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#003">bdellium</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#000">mortar</a>, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> fell upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> in the night, the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> fell upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD was kindled greatly; <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> also was displeased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of all this people upon me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Whence should I have <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, that we may eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, that they may stand there with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to eat? for it was well with us in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: therefore the LORD will give you <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and ye shall eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, that they may eat a whole month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?  or shall all the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the LORD came down in a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and spake unto him, and took of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But there remained two of the men in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, the name of the one was <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#007">Eldad</a>, and the name of the other <a href="../ebd/ebd245.htm#007">Medad</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>: and they prophesied in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And there ran a young man, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#007">Eldad</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd245.htm#007">Medad</a> do prophesy in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</a>, the servant of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, forbid them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> upon them!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> gat him into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, he and the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</a> from the sea, and let them fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, as it were a day's <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> on this side, and as it were a day's <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> on the other side, round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</a>: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And while the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#003">Hazeroth</a>; and abode at <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#003">Hazeroth</a>.<br>
