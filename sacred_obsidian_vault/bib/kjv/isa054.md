 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 54</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Sing, O <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Enlarge the place of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a> the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> kindness will I have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on thee, saith the LORD thy <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For this is as the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a> should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> In <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Behold, I have created the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#006">smith</a> that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> is of me, saith the LORD.<br>
