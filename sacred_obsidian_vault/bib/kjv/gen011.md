 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, that they found a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#004">slime</a> had they for morter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.<br>
