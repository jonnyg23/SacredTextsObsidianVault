 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God bestowed on the churches of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, and take upon us the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> of the ministering to the saints.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Insomuch that we desired <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a>, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For ye know the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, that ye through his poverty might be rich.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But thanks be to God, which put the same <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</a> care into the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a> for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> throughout all the churches;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And not that only, but who was also <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> of the churches to travel with us with this <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, which is administered by us to the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Whether any do enquire of <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a>, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.<br>
