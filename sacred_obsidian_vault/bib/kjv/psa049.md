 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 49</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear this, all ye people; give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, all ye inhabitants of the world:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Both low and high, rich and <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I will incline mine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>: I will open my dark saying upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a> for him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> (For the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he seeth that <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Like <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> they are laid in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> from their dwelling.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>: for he shall receive me. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his house is increased;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shall not descend after him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He shall go to the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of his fathers; they shall never see light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.<br>
