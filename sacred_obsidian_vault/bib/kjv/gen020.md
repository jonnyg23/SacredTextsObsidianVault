 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#003">Kadesh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#002">Shur</a>, and sojourned in <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said of <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> his wife, She is my sister: and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a> sent, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But God came to <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And God said unto him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and restored him <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> prayed unto God: and God healed <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a>, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For the LORD had <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> closed up all the wombs of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a>, because of <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> Abraham's wife.<br>
