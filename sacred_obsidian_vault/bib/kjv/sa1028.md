 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in those days, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a>, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> was dead, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had lamented him, and buried him in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, even in his own city. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#001">Shunem</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> gathered all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> together, and they pitched in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#005">Urim</a>, nor by prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#006">Endor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> for my life, to cause me to die?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> happen to thee for this thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when the woman saw <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> perceived that it was <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> answered, I am sore distressed; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#009">Amalek</a>, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Moreover the LORD will also deliver <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with thee into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> all the day, nor all the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the woman came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, and let me set a morsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the woman had a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a> in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a>, and kneaded it, and did <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</a> unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> thereof:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And she brought it before <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.<br>
