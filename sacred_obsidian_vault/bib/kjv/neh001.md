 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The words of <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#007">Nehemiah</a> the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#002">Chisleu</a>, in the twentieth year, as I was in <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#003">Hanani</a>, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, and concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, the great and terrible God, that keepeth <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> for them that love him and observe his commandments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> to set my name there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> be attentive to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of thy servant, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.<br>
