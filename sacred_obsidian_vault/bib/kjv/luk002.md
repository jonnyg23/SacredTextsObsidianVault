 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#006">Augustus</a> that all the world should be taxed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> (And this <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#009">taxing</a> was first made when <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#005">Cyrenius</a> was governor of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> also went up from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, out of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, into Judaea, unto the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>; (because he was of the house and lineage of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To be taxed with <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> his espoused wife, being great with child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#005">manger</a>; because there was no room for them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#004">inn</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And, lo, the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord came upon them, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For unto you is born this day in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</a> wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#005">manger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And suddenly there was with the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> a multitude of the heavenly <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> praising God, and saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">Glory</a> to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they came with haste, and found <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</a> lying in a <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#005">manger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</a>, which was so named of the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> before he was conceived in the womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when the days of her <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</a> according to the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> were accomplished, they brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to present him to the Lord;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And to offer a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And, behold, there was a man in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a>; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> was upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he came by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: and when the parents brought in the child <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, to do for him after the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> of the law,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For mine eyes have seen thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> A light to lighten the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> blessed them, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> (Yea, a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And there was one <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#006">Anna</a>, a prophetess, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#004">Phanuel</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years from her virginity;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, to their own city <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And the child grew, and waxed strong in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, filled with wisdom: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God was upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Now his parents went to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> every year at the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And when he was twelve years old, they went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> after the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> tarried behind in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> and his mother knew not of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And when they found him not, they turned back again to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, seeking him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And he went down with them, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.<br>
