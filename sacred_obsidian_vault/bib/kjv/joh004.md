 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When therefore the LORD knew how the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> had heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> made and baptized more disciples than John,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> (Though <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> himself baptized not, but his disciples,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He left Judaea, and departed again into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he must needs go through <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then cometh he to a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#006">Sychar</a>, near to the parcel of ground that <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> gave to his son <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now Jacob's well was there. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore, being wearied with his <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> There cometh a woman of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> to draw water: <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, Give me to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then saith the woman of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> unto him, How is it that thou, being a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, askest <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of me, which am a woman of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>? for the Jews have no dealings with the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>: from whence then hast thou that living water?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Art thou greater than our father <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> is the place where men ought to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Ye <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> ye know not what: we know what we <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>: for <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> is of the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the Father in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> God is a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>: and they that <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him must <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> him in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> and in truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: when he is come, he will tell us all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And he that reapeth receiveth <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>, and gathereth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And many of the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</a> of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> So when the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</a> were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And many more believed because of his own word;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> himself testified, that a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> hath no honour in his own country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then when he was come into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> at the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>: for they also went unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came again into <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, where he made the water <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>. And there was a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#005">nobleman</a>, whose son was sick at <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> When he heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was come out of Judaea into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#005">nobleman</a> saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had spoken unto him, and he went his way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</a> left him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> This is again the second <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> did, when he was come out of Judaea into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
