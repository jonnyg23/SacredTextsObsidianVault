 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were come out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, in the month <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#001">Zif</a>, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the house which <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the porch before the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>: and he made chambers round about:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The nethermost <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the house, when it was in building, was built of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#000">hammer</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</a> nor any tool of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> heard in the house, while it was in building.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The door for the middle <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>, and out of the middle into the third.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I will dwell among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and will not forsake my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> built the house, and finished it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he built the walls of the house within with boards of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#009">ceiling</a>: and he covered them on the inside with <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and covered the floor of the house with planks of <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>: he even built them for it within, even for the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>, even for the most holy place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the house, that is, the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> before it, was forty cubits long.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> of the house within was carved with knops and open <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a>: all was <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>; there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> seen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> he prepared in the house within, to set there the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; and so covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> which was of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> overlaid the house within with pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: and he made a partition by the chains of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>; and he overlaid it with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the whole house he overlaid with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, until he had finished all the house: also the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> that was by the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> he overlaid with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And within the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> he made two cherubims of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, each ten cubits high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And five cubits was the one wing of the <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a>, and five cubits the other wing of the <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a>: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the other <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a> was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The height of the one <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a> was ten cubits, and so was it of the other <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</a> touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he overlaid the cherubims with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a>, within and without.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the floors of the house he overlaid with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, within and without.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And for the entering of the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> he made <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree: the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#000">lintel</a> and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The two <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> also were of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a>, and overlaid them with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and spread <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> So also made he for the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> posts of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, a fourth part of the wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And the two <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> were of <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</a>: and covered them with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> fitted upon the carved work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and a row of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> beams.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#001">Zif</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And in the eleventh year, in the month <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#002">Bul</a>, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years in building it.<br>
