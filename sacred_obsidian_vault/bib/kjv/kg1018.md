 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>; and I will send <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> went to shew himself unto <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>. And there was a sore <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a>, which was the governor of his house. (Now <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a> feared the LORD greatly:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For it was so, when <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> cut off the prophets of the LORD, that <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a> took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and fed them with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and water.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a>, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> went one way by himself, and <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a> went another way by himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a> was in the way, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> is here.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, to slay me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> is here.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Was it not told my lord what I did when <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and fed them with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and water?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> is here: and he shall slay me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a> went to meet <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, and told him: and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> went to meet <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> saw <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he answered, I have not troubled <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now therefore send, and gather to me all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>, and the prophets of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a> four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> sent unto all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and gathered the prophets together unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> came unto all the people, and said, How long <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#002">halt</a> ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> unto the people, I, even I only, remain a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> for themselves, and cut it in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and lay it on <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and put no fire under: and I will <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> the other <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, and lay it on <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and put no fire under:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto the prophets of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, Choose you one <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> for yourselves, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they took the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a> from morning even until noon, saying, O <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> which was made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass at noon, that <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> gushed out upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the evening <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD that was broken down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be thy name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And with the stones he built an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, as great as would contain two measures of seed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he put the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> in order, and cut the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and laid him on the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, and on the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the water ran round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>; and he filled the trench also with water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And it came to pass at the time of the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the evening <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> came near, and said, LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, let it be known this day that thou art God in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and the stones, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and licked up the water that was in the trench.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto them, Take the prophets of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> brought them down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#009">Kishon</a>, and slew them there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, Get thee up, eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; for there is a sound of abundance of <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> went up to eat and to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> went up to the top of <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, Prepare thy <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, and get thee down that the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> stop thee not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> rode, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And the hand of the LORD was on <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>; and he girded up his loins, and ran before <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> to the entrance of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>.<br>
