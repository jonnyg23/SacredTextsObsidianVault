 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 59</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> heavy, that it cannot hear:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For your hands are defiled with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> None calleth for <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#008">viper</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> are in their paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> We grope for the wall like the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> We roar all like bears, and <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, but it is far off from us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And judgment is turned away backward, and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto him; and his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, it sustained him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For he put on <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> as a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#007">breastplate</a>, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#004">helmet</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> as a <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#009">cloak</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> from the rising of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>. When the enemy shall come in like a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</a> shall come to <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and unto them that turn from transgression in <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> As for me, this is my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them, saith the LORD; My <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.<br>
