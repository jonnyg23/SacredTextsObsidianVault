 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And after six days <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> taketh <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and his raiment was white as the light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And, behold, there appeared unto them <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> talking with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and one for <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> While he yet spake, behold, a bright <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> only.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And as they came down from the mountain, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> charged them, saying, Tell the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> must first come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> truly shall first come, and restore all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But I say unto you, That <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Lord, have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said, O faithless and perverse <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> rebuked the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then came the disciples to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#009">mustard</a> seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and fasting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And while they abode in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when they were come to <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>, they that received <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> money came to <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and said, Doth not your master pay <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>? of whom do the kings of the earth take <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>? of their own children, or of strangers?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> saith unto him, Of strangers. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, Then are the children free.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</a>, and take up the <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a> that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.<br>
