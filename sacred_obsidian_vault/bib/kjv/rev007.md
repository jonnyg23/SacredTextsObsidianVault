 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I saw another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> ascending from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, having the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</a> were sealed twelve thousand.

 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and before the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And cried with a loud voice, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">Salvation</a> to our God which sitteth upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And all the angels stood round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> on their faces, and worshipped God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>: Blessing, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore are they before the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of God, and serve him day and night in his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: and he that sitteth on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> shall dwell among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> light on them, nor any heat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> which is in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.<br>
