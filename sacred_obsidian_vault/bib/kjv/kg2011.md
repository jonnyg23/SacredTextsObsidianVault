 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#008">Jehosheba</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>, sister of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>, took <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a>, so that he was not slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> did reign over the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the seventh year <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them, and took an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And a third part shall be at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of Sur; and a third part at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> behind the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And two parts of all you that go forth on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And ye shall compass the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#004">ranges</a>, let him be slain: and be ye with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> as he goeth out and as he cometh in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, with them that should go out on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And to the captains over hundreds did the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> give <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> David's spears and shields, that were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, from the right corner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> to the left corner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, along by the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he brought forth the king's son, and put the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> upon him, and gave him the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>; and they made him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> heard the noise of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> and of the people, she came to the people into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when she looked, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> stood by a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, and said unto them, Have her forth without the <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#004">ranges</a>: and him that followeth her kill with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>. For the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> between the LORD and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> also and the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And all the people of the land went into the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> thoroughly, and slew <a href="../ebd/ebd243.htm#007">Mattan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a> before the altars. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> appointed officers over the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> to the king's house. And he sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of the kings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> beside the king's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</a> years old was <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#007">Jehoash</a> when he began to reign.<br>
