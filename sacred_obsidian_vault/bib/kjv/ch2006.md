 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But I have built an house of <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> turned his face, and blessed the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> I chose no city among all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that my name might be there; and have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to be over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now it was in the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But the LORD said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, and am set on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And in it have I put the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, wherein is the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, that he made with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD in the presence of all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and spread forth his hands:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and spread forth his hands toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And said, O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, there is no God like thee in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, nor in the earth; which keepest <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and shewest <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thou which hast kept with thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now therefore, O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, keep with thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now then, O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Have respect therefore to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> which thy servant prayeth before thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> which thy servant prayeth toward this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and when thou hearest, forgive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> If a man <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against his neighbour, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> be laid upon him to make him swear, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> come before thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> in this house;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then hear thou from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and do, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And if thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> When the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is shut up, and there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, when thou dost afflict them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then hear thou from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and forgive the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of thy servants, and of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> If there be <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a> in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#007">mildew</a>, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then what <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then hear thou from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Moreover concerning the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, which is not of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, and the house which I have built for thy name;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then hear thou from the heavens their <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and their supplication, and maintain their cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> If they <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> that is made in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, and let thy saints rejoice in <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy servant.<br>
