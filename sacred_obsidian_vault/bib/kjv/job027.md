 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover Job continued his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> All the while my breath is in me, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of God is in my nostrils;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> I hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For what is the hope of the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a>, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> If his children be multiplied, it is for the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> shall not weep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Though he <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> up <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and prepare raiment as the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He buildeth his house as a <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a>, and as a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#005">booth</a> that the keeper maketh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</a> him out of his place.<br>
