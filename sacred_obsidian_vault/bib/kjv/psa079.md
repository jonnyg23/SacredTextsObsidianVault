 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 79</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O God, the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> are come into thine inheritance; thy holy <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> have they defiled; they have laid <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> on heaps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> have they shed like water round about <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and there was none to bury them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> burn like fire?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Pour out thy wrath upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For they have devoured <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and laid waste his dwelling place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Help us, O God of our <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Wherefore should the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> say, Where is their God? let him be known among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> in our sight by the revenging of the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of thy servants which is shed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a> their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So we thy people and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.<br>
