 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 37</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For they shall soon be cut down like the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, and wither as the green <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he shall bring forth thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Cease from <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> to do evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The wicked have drawn out the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and have bent their <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, to cast down the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy, and to slay such as be of upright <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> they shall be satisfied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, and giveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#001">bay</a> tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.<br>
