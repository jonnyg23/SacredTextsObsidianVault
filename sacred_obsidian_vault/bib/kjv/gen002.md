 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the LORD God formed man of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>; and there he put the man whom he had formed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And a river went out of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a> to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The name of the first is <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#006">Pison</a>: that is it which compasseth the whole land of <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#009">Havilah</a>, where there is <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> of that land is good: there is <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#003">bdellium</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#004">onyx</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the name of the second river is <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#007">Gihon</a>: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the name of the third river is <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#009">Hiddekel</a>: that is it which goeth toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>. And the fourth river is <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> it and to keep it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> to see what he would call them: and whatsoever <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> called every living <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a>, that was the name thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> gave names to all <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and to the fowl of the air, and to every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the field; but for <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> there was not found an help meet for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD God caused a <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> sleep to fall upon <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a>, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> instead thereof;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> said, This is now bone of my bones, and <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they were both <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.<br>
