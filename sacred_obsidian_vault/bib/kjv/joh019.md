 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Pilate therefore took <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and scourged him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the soldiers platted a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said, <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then came <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> forth, wearing the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, Whence art thou? But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> gave him no answer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> speaketh against <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#003">Pavement</a>, but in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#005">Gabbatha</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it was the preparation of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>? The chief priests answered, We have no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> but <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and led him away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he bearing his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a> went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#004">Golgotha</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> in the midst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</a> OF <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">NAZARETH</a> THE <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</a> OF THE JEWS.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#007">Latin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews; but that he said, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a>: now the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a> was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Now there stood by the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> his mother, and his mother's sister, <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#008">Cleophas</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore saw his mother, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then saith he to the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a>, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> took her unto his own home.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> After this, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Now there was set a vessel full of <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a>: and they filled a spunge with <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a>, and put it upon <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#007">hyssop</a>, and put it to his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore had received the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a>, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, (for that <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> But when they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> and water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For these things were done, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And again another <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And after this <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> of Arimathaea, being a <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And there came also <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</a>, which at the first came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> by night, and brought a mixture of <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#004">aloes</a>, about an hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#008">pound</a> weight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Then took they the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and wound it in <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> clothes with the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, wherein was never man yet laid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> There laid they <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> was nigh at hand.<br>
