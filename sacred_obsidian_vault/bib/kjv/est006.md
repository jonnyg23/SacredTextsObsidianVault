 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> On that night could not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a>; and they were read before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it was found written, that <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> had told of Bigthana and <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#004">Teresh</a>, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, What honour and dignity hath been done to <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Who is in the court? Now <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to hang <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#005">gallows</a> that he had prepared for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> standeth in the court. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Let him come in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> came in. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delighteth to honour? Now <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> thought in his heart, To whom would the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delight to do honour more than to myself?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> answered the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, For the man whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delighteth to honour,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Let the royal <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a> be brought which the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> useth to wear, and the horse that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> rideth upon, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> royal which is set upon his head:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And let this <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a> and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delighteth to honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a>, Make haste, and take the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a> and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, that sitteth at the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then took <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a> and the horse, and arrayed <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delighteth to honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> came again to the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>. But <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> told <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#006">Zeresh</a> his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men and <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#006">Zeresh</a> his wife unto him, If <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#006">banquet</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> had prepared.<br>
