 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 32</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> My doctrine shall drop as the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, my speech shall distil as the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a>, as the small <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon the tender <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a>, and as the showers upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He is the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a>, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a>, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the LORD's portion is his people; <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> is the lot of his inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He found him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> land, and in the waste howling <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</a> of his eye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> As an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a> stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and oil out of the flinty <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">Butter</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of lambs, and rams of the breed of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>, and goats, with the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of kidneys of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>; and thou didst <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the pure <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#004">Jeshurun</a> waxed <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, and kicked: thou art waxen <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They provoked him to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a> that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, children in whom is no faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> They have moved me to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> with that which is not God; they have provoked me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their vanities: and I will move them to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with a foolish nation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For a fire is kindled in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and shall burn unto the lowest <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I will <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</a> of serpents of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> O that they were <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a> had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For their <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> is not as our <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</a>, even our enemies themselves being judges.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For their <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> is of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>, and of the fields of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a>: their grapes are grapes of <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a>, their clusters are <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Their <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> is the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</a> of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For the LORD shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And he shall say, Where are their gods, their <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> in whom they trusted,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Which did eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of their sacrifices, and drank the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of their <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> For I lift up my hand to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and say, I live for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> If I whet my glittering <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> I will make mine <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall devour <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; and that with the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#006">Hoshea</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> made an end of speaking all these words to all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> to possess it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> that selfsame day, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Get thee up into this mountain <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#006">Abarim</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#004">Nebo</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, that is over against <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>; and behold the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, which I give unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for a possession:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And die in the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> thy brother died in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#008">Hor</a>, and was gathered unto his people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Because ye trespassed against me among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#000">Zin</a>; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
