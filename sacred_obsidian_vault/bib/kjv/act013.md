 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now there were in the church that was at <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a> certain prophets and teachers; as <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> that was called <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#009">Niger</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd232.htm#007">Lucius</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#001">Manaen</a>, which had been brought up with Herod the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> said, Separate me <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> for the work whereunto I have called them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So they, being sent forth by the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, departed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#009">Seleucia</a>; and from thence they sailed to <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when they were at <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#008">Salamis</a>, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when they had gone through the isle unto <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#002">Paphos</a>, they found a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#006">sorcerer</a>, a false <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, whose name was Barjesus:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Which was with the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</a> of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and desired to hear the word of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#004">Elymas</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#006">sorcerer</a> (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</a> from the faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, (who also is called <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>,) filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, set his eyes on him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>, thou enemy of all <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, not seeing the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</a>, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and his company loosed from <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#002">Paphos</a>, they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#003">Perga</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</a>: and John departing from them returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But when they departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#003">Perga</a>, they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#005">Pisidia</a>, and went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, and sat down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and ye that fear God, give audience.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The God of this people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when he had destroyed <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And afterward they desired a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: and God gave unto them <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> the son of Cis, a man of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, by the space of forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to be their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; to whom also he gave their <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>, and said, I have found <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> to all the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?  I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Men and brethren, children of the stock of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> sent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For they that dwell at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But God raised him from the dead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, who are his witnesses unto the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, I will give you the sure mercies of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, after he had served his own <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> believe, though a man declare it unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And when the Jews were gone out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> besought that these words might be preached to them the next <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Now when the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And the next <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, contradicting and blaspheming.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> yourselves unworthy of <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life, lo, we turn to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, that thou shouldest be for <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto the ends of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, and expelled them out of their coasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> But they shook off the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of their feet against them, and came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
