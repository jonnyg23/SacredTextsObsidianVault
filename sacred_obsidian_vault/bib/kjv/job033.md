 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I am <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> In a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, in a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of the night, when <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He keepeth back his soul from the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and his life from perishing by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> So that his life abhorreth <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and his soul dainty meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> His <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, and his life to the destroyers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> If there be a <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>: I have found a <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> His <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> He will deliver his soul from going into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and his life shall see the light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> To bring back his soul from the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, to be enlightened with the light of the living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.<br>
