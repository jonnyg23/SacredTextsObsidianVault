 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He hath led me, and brought me into <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, but not into light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> and travail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a> heavy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, he hath made my paths crooked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>: he hath made me desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He hath bent his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He hath caused the <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#000">quiver</a> to enter into my <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> It is good for a man that he bear the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of his youth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He putteth his mouth in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>; if so be there may be hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> He giveth his <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</a> to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For the LORD will not cast off for ever:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of his sins?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Thou hast covered with <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Thou hast covered thyself with a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, that our <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> should not pass through.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Fear and a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> is come upon us, desolation and <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of the daughter of my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Till the LORD look down, and behold from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a>, without cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> They have cut off my life in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>, and cast a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> at my breathing, at my cry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thou my cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> Behold their <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> down, and their rising up; I am their musick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> Give them sorrow of heart, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> Persecute and destroy them in <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> from under the heavens of the LORD.<br>
