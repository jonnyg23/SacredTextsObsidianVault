 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 41</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</a>, of the seed royal, and the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, even ten men with him, came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>; and there they did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> together in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then arose <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, and the ten men that were with him, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and slew him, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had made governor over the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a>, at <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass the second day after he had slain <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a>, and no man knew it,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That there came certain from <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>, and having cut themselves, with offerings and <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> went forth from <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a> to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> slew them, and cast them into the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, he, and the men that were with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But ten men were found among them that said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>, and of oil, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> wherein <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a>, was it which <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had made for fear of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> filled it with them that were slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> all the residue of the people that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> had committed to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> carried them away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> that were with him, heard of all the evil that <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> had done,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then they took all the men, and went to fight with <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, and found him by the great waters that are in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> saw <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> that were with him, then they were glad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So all the people that <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> had carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a> cast about and returned, and went unto <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> escaped from <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then took <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, after that he had slain <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a>, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they departed, and dwelt in the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd080.htm#009">Chimham</a>, which is by <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, to go to enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> had slain <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> made governor in the land.<br>
