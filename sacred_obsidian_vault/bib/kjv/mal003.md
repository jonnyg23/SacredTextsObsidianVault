 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Malachi Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Behold, I will send my <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a>, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#002">soap</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he shall sit as a <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#001">refiner</a> and purifier of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: and he shall purify the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, and purge them as <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, that they may offer unto the LORD an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</a> in his <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> are not consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Ye are cursed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> cast her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<br>
