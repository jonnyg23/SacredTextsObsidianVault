 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he spake this <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> unto them, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> What man of you, having an hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> which was lost.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Either what woman having ten <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, if she lose one piece, doth not light a <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a>, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said, A certain man had two sons:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> in that land; and he began to be in want.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he would fain have filled his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> with the husks that the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</a> did eat: and no man gave unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and before thee,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and kissed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</a> on his hand, and shoes on his feet:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And bring hither the fatted <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a>, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Now his <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a>, because he hath received him safe and sound.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.<br>
