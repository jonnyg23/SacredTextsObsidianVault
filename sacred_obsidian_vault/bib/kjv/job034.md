 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 34</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Furthermore <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</a> answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Hear my words, O ye <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men; and give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> unto me, ye that have knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> and his breath;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> All <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Is it fit to say to a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>? for they all are the work of his hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> There is no <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He shall break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So that they cause the cry of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> That the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a> reign not, lest the people be ensnared.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man hearken unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For he addeth rebellion unto his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.<br>
