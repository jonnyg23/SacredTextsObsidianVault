 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 124</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> say;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Our soul is escaped as a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> of the fowlers: the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> is broken, and we are escaped.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth.<br>
