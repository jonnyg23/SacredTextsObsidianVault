 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> He, that being often reproved hardeneth his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> for his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> In the transgression of an evil man there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The righteous considereth the cause of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Scornful men bring a city into a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men turn away wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> A fool uttereth all his mind: but a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man keepeth it in till afterwards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that faithfully judgeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> shall be established for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Where there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The fear of man bringeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> An unjust man is an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the just: and he that is upright in the way is <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the wicked.<br>
