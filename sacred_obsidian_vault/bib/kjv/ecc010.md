 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Dead flies cause the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#009">apothecary</a> to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> If the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> There is an evil which I have seen under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that diggeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> shall bite him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> shall be endangered thereby.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Surely the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The words of a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> up himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Woe to thee, O land, when thy <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> is made for laughter, and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> maketh merry: but money answereth all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">Curse</a> not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, no not in thy thought; and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.<br>
