 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</a> did see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Lift ye up a <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#005">banner</a> upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, even them that rejoice in my highness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They come from a far country, from the end of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> from the Almighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shall be darkened in his going forth, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> shall not cause her light to shine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I will make a man more precious than fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; even a man than the golden wedge of <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it shall be as the chased <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#002">roe</a>, and as a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Their children also shall be dashed to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; and as for <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, they shall not delight in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Their bows also shall dash the young men to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; and they shall have no pity on the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>: neither shall the Arabian <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#008">pitch</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> there; neither shall the shepherds make their <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</a> there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But wild beasts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</a> there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.<br>
