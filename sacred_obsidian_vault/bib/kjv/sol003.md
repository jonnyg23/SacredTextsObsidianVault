 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> of her that conceived me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I charge you, O ye daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who is this that cometh out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> like pillars of smoke, perfumed with <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#004">frankincense</a>, with all powders of the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#003">merchant</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> upon his thigh because of fear in the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made himself a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He made the pillars thereof of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, the bottom thereof of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Go forth, O ye daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and behold <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.<br>
