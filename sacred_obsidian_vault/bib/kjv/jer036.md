 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 36</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in the fourth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that this word came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Take thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a>, even unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> It may be that the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the son of Neriah: and <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> wrote from the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> of a book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a>, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore go thou, and read in the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> that come out of their cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the son of Neriah did according to all that <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it came to pass in the fifth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> before the LORD to all the people in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and to all the people that came from the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then read <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> in the book the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> in the house of the LORD, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a> the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#000">Michaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a>, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</a> the scribe, and <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#001">Delaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#007">Achbor</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, and all the princes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#000">Michaiah</a> declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> read the book in the ears of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore all the princes sent <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</a>, the son of Cushi, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a>, saying, Take in thine hand the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the son of Neriah took the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> in his hand, and came unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> read it in their ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a>, We will surely tell the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of all these words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they asked <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a>, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then said the princes unto <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a>, Go, hide thee, thou and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>; and let no man know where ye be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they went in to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> into the court, but they laid up the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</a> the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</a> to fetch the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>: and he took it out of <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</a> the scribe's <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</a> read it in the ears of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</a> burning before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass, that when <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</a> had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</a>, until all the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> was consumed in the fire that was on the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Yet they were not afraid, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> their garments, neither the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Nevertheless <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#001">Delaiah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</a> had made intercession to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that he would not burn the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>: but he would not hear them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#005">Jerahmeel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#009">Hammelech</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> the son of Azriel, and <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#009">Abdeel</a>, to take <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the scribe and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>: but the LORD hid them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, after that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had burned the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, and the words which <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> wrote at the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Take thee again another <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, and write in it all the former words that were in the first <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> hath burned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And thou shalt say to <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; He shall have none to sit upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and upon the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then took <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> another <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a>, and gave it to <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> all the words of the book which <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.<br>
