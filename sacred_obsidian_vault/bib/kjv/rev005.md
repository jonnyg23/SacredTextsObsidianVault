 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> a book written within and on the backside, sealed with <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> seals.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I saw a strong <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And no man in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</a>, the Root of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> seals thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> as it had been slain, having <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> horns and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> eyes, which are the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and blessing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And every <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the four beasts said, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<br>
