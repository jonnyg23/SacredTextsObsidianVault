 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> is written with a pen of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and with the point of a <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#001">diamond</a>: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, throughout all thy borders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, which shall burn for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For he shall be like the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#004">heath</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, in a <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a> land and not inhabited.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</a> shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</a>, neither shall cease from yielding <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I the LORD search the heart, I try the <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</a>, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of his doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> As the <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#007">partridge</a> sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> A glorious high <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> from the beginning is the place of our <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> O LORD, the hope of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of living waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the children of the people, whereby the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that enter in by these gates:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, nor bring it in by the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Neither carry forth a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> out of your houses on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, neither do ye any work, but <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, as I commanded your fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But they obeyed not, neither inclined their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, but made their <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a> stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> through the gates of this city on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, but <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, to do no work therein;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and this city shall remain for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they shall come from the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and from the places about <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and from the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But if ye will not hearken unto me to <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, and not to bear a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>, even entering in at the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and it shall not be quenched.<br>
