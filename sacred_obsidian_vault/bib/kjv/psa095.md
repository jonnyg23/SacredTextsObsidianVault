 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 95</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> of our <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the LORD is a great God, and a great <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> above all gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> In his hand are the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> O come, let us <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Forty years long was I grieved with this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.<br>
