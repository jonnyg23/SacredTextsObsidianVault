 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, to feed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a>, and to gather lilies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, terrible as an army with banners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thy teeth are as a flock of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> which go up from the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</a>, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> As a piece of a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</a> are thy temples within thy locks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a>, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, clear as the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and terrible as an army with banners?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I went down into the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#007">nuts</a> to see the fruits of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, and to see whether the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> flourished and the pomegranates budded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#009">Amminadib</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Return, return, O <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#009">Shulamite</a>; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#009">Shulamite</a>? As it were the company of two armies.<br>
