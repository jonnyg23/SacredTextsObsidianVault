 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, who walk not after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, but after the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the law of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of life in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> hath made me free from the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> and death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, condemned <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, but after the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For they that are after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> do mind the things of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; but they that are after the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> the things of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Because the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</a> mind is <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</a> against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So then they that are in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> cannot please God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But ye are not in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, but in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, he is none of his.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And if <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be in you, the body is dead because of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> is life because of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But if the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of him that raised up <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> that dwelleth in you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, to live after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For if ye live after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, ye shall die: but if ye through the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For as many as are led by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God, they are the sons of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For ye have not received the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> again to fear; but ye have received the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</a>, whereby we cry, <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#007">Abba</a>, Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> itself beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> with our <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, that we are the children of God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</a> expectation of the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Because the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> itself also shall be delivered from the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For we know that the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</a> groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</a>, to wit, the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> of our body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Likewise the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Who is he that condemneth? It is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Who shall separate us from the love of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? shall <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, or distress, or <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, or nakedness, or peril, or <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> for the slaughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a>, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> our Lord.<br>
