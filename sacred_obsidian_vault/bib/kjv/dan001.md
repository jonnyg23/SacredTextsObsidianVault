 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the third year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> came <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and besieged it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the Lord gave <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#003">Ashpenaz</a> the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Children in whom was no <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now among these were of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Unto whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#002">Belteshazzar</a>; and to <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#003">Shadrach</a>; and to <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd250.htm#007">Meshach</a>; and to <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd001.htm#003">Abednego</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> which he drank: therefore he requested of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Now God had brought <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> into favour and tender love with the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the eunuchs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the eunuchs said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, I fear my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, who hath appointed your meat and your <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd247.htm#008">Melzar</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the eunuchs had set over <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#004">pulse</a> to eat, and water to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thus <a href="../ebd/ebd247.htm#008">Melzar</a> took away the portion of their meat, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> that they should <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; and gave them <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#004">pulse</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> had understanding in all visions and dreams.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now at the end of the days that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had said he should bring them in, then the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the eunuchs brought them in before <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> communed with them; and among them all was found none like <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a>: therefore stood they before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a> and astrologers that were in all his realm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> continued even unto the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a>.<br>
