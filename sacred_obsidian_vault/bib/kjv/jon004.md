 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jonah Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But it displeased <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a> exceedingly, and he was very angry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</a>: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a> went out of the city, and sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> side of the city, and there made him a <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#005">booth</a>, and sat under it in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a>, till he might see what would become of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD God prepared a <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</a>, and made it to come up over <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a>, that it might be a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a> was exceeding glad of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But God prepared a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a> when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</a> that it withered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> did arise, that God prepared a vehement <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> beat upon the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a>, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And God said to <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</a>, Doest thou well to be angry for the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</a>? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</a>, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And should not I spare <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a>, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>?<br>
