 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 142</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> When my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Bring my soul out of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.<br>
