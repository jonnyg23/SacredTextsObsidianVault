 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#007">Hephzibah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, whom the LORD cast out before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For he built up again the high places which <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a>, as did <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and worshipped all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and served them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> will I put my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he built altars for all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> in the two courts of the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</a>, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he set a graven image of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</a> that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> his son, In this house, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> out of all tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, will I put my name for ever:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Neither will I make the feet of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> commanded them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But they hearkened not: and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Because <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> did, which were before him, and hath made <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> also to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> with his idols:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I will stretch over <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> the line of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and the plummet of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>: and I will wipe <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> as a man wipeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#004">dish</a>, wiping it, and turning it upside down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, since the day their fathers came forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, even unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> shed innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> very much, till he had filled <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> from one end to another; beside his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> wherewith he made <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, and all that he did, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#000">Uzza</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a> was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#002">Meshullemeth</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#007">Haruz</a> of Jotbah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a> conspired against him, and slew the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his own house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a>; and the people of the land made <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> his son <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a> which he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he was buried in his <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> in the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#000">Uzza</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
