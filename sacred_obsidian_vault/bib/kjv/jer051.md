 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 51</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And will send unto <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> fanners, that shall <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a> her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Against him that bendeth let the <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#002">archer</a> bend his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, and against him that lifteth himself up in his <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#004">brigandine</a>: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath not been forsaken, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Flee out of the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath been a golden <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>; therefore the nations are mad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#009">balm</a> for her pain, if so be she may be healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> We would have healed <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and is lifted up even to the skies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The LORD hath brought forth our <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: come, and let us declare in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> the work of the LORD our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Make bright the <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a>; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Set up the standard upon the walls of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> by his understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The portion of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou art my battle <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</a> and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> and his rider;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> With thee also will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> man and woman; and with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> old and young; and with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the young man and the maid;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I will also break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> with thee the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> and his flock; and with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</a> and his <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of oxen; and with thee will I break in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> captains and rulers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And I will render unto <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> and to all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#000">Chaldea</a> all their evil that they have done in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> in your sight, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they shall not take of thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> for a corner, nor a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of <a href="../ebd/ebd028.htm#005">Ararat</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#008">Minni</a>, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, to make the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> a desolation without an inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The mighty men of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> One <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</a> shall run to meet another, and one <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> to meet another, to shew the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> that his city is taken at one end,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; The daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> shall come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a>, he hath filled his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> with my delicates, he hath cast me out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> The violence done to me and to my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> be upon <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, shall the inhabitant of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> say; and my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> upon the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#000">Chaldea</a>, shall <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> say.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> They shall roar together like <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>: they shall yell as lions' whelps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> How is <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#001">Sheshach</a> taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> become an astonishment among the nations!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> The sea is come up upon <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And I will punish <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#005">Bel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> As <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath caused the slain of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to fall, so at <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall fall the slain of all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Ye that have escaped the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> come into your mind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Though <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> should <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> A sound of a cry cometh from <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and great <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> from the land of the Chaldeans:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> Because the LORD hath spoiled <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> And I will make <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> her princes, and her <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>, whose name is the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> The word which <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> the son of Neriah, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a>, when he went with <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> in the fourth year of his reign. And this <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> was a quiet <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, even all these words that are written against <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a>, When thou comest to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, but that it shall be desolate for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> to it, and cast it into the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> And thou shalt say, Thus shall <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>.<br>
