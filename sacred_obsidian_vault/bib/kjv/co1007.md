 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Nevertheless, to avoid <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>; and come together again, that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> tempt you not for your incontinency.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God, one after this manner, and another after that.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I say therefore to the unmarried and <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a>, It is good for them if they abide even as I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">Circumcision</a> is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Let every man abide in the same <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> wherein he was called.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> of the Lord to be <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: but I spare you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> There is difference also between a wife and a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a>, doeth well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
