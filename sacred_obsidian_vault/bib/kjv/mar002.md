 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And again he entered into <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a> after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>, which was borne of four.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a> lay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But there was certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> there, and reasoning in their hearts,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And immediately when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> perceived in his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And as he passed by, he saw <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#005">Alphaeus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> at the receipt of <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass, that, as <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</a>, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the disciples of John and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> used to <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, but thy disciples <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> in those days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> is made worse.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And no man putteth new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> into old bottles: else the new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> doth burst the bottles, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> must be put into new bottles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it came to pass, that he went through the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> fields on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> said unto him, Behold, why do they on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day that which is not lawful?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he said unto them, Have ye never read what <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> How he went into the house of God in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and did eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he said unto them, The <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> was made for man, and not man for the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>.<br>
