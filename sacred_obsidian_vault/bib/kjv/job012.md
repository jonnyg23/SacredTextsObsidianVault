 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</a> despised in the thought of him that is at ease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Doth not the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> try words? and the mouth taste his meat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He looseth the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> of kings, and girdeth their loins with a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He discovereth <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> things out of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and bringeth out to light the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> where there is no way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.<br>
