 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>, and unto the two handmaids.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> and her children after, and <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> hindermost.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> times, until he came near to his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and kissed him: and they wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a> also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> near and <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>, and they bowed themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in the sight of my lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he said, Let us take our <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and let us go, and I will go before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in the sight of my lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> returned that day on his way unto <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> journeyed to <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>, and built him an house, and made booths for his <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>: therefore the name of the place is called <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#004">Shalem</a>, a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> before the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, at the hand of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a>, Shechem's father, for an hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he erected there an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and called it EleloheIsrael.<br>
