 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 35</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Son of man, set thy face against <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, and prophesy against it,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Because thou hast had a perpetual <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a>, and hast shed the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> by the force of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall pursue thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Thus will I make <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a> against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
