 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 55</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to my <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Attend unto me, and hear me: I <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> in my complaint, and make a noise;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a>! for then would I <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> away, and be at rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>: for wickedness is in their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a>, and among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</a>. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The words of his mouth were smoother than <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</a>, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Cast thy <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.<br>
