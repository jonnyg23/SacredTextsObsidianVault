 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezra Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now when the adversaries of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> heard that the children of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> builded the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a>, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto him since the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#004">Esarhaddon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Assur, which brought us up hither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</a>, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a> hath commanded us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and troubled them in building,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, even until the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And in the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</a> wrote Bishlam, <a href="../ebd/ebd257.htm#005">Mithredath</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#000">Tabeel</a>, and the rest of their companions, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#009">Rehum</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#000">chancellor</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#000">Shimshai</a> the scribe wrote a letter against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in this sort:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then wrote <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#009">Rehum</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#000">chancellor</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#000">Shimshai</a> the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#001">Apharsites</a>, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#006">Susanchites</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#000">Dehavites</a>, and the Elamites,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#009">Asnapper</a> brought over, and set in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Be it known unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Be it known now unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#000">toll</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now because we have maintenance from the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> We certify the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then sent the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> an answer unto <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#009">Rehum</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#000">chancellor</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#000">Shimshai</a> the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> There have been mighty kings also over <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#000">toll</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>, was paid unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now when the copy of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Artaxerxes' letter was read before <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#009">Rehum</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#000">Shimshai</a> the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>.<br>
