 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John went up together into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> at the hour of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, being the ninth hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> which is called Beautiful, to ask <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> of them that entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who seeing <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John about to go into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> asked an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">Silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a> rise up and walk.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, walking, and leaping, and praising God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And all the people saw him walking and praising God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they knew that it was he which sat for <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> at the Beautiful <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And as the lame man which was healed held <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a> we had made this man to walk?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And killed the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</a> of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he shall send <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, which before was preached unto you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> truly said unto the fathers, A <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, shall be destroyed from among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Yea, and all the prophets from <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which God made with our fathers, saying unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Unto you first God, having raised up his Son <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, sent him to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.<br>
