 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And after five days <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a> the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#006">Tertullus</a>, who informed the governor against <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when he was called forth, <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#006">Tertullus</a> began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#004">providence</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> We accept it always, and in all places, most noble <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a>, with all thankfulness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</a> of the Nazarenes:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who also hath gone about to profane the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they neither found me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call <a href="../ebd/ebd175.htm#002">heresy</a>, so <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> void to offence toward God, and toward men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now after many years I came to bring <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> to my nation, and offerings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whereupon certain Jews from <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a> found me purified in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a> heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he commanded a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> to keep <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> or come unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And after certain days, when <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a> came with his wife <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#008">Drusilla</a>, which was a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#005">Jewess</a>, he sent for <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and heard him concerning the faith in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And as he reasoned of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, temperance, and judgment to come, <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a> trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He hoped also that money should have been given him of <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a>, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> bound.<br>
