 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>: see, I have given into thy hand the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, and his people, and his city, and his land:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And thou shalt do to <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> and her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> as thou didst unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> and her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: only the spoil thereof, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a> for the city behind it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> arose, and all the people of war, to go up against <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then ye shall rise up from the <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a>, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a>, and abode between <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, on the west side of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> lodged that night among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, before the people to <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>: now there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> between them and <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a> between <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, on the west side of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when they had set the people, even all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> went that night into the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it came to pass, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>; but he wist not that there were liers in <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a> against him behind the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And all the people that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and were drawn away from the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And there was not a man left in <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, that went not out after <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and they left the city open, and pursued after <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>; for I will give it into thine hand. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a> arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> turned back upon the pursuers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw that the <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</a> had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> they took alive, and brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> in the field, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, and smote it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Only the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> and the spoil of that city <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, and made it an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> for ever, even a desolation unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> was down, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> commanded that they should take his <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</a> down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the city, and raise thereon a great <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> of stones, that remaineth unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> built an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#007">Ebal</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> As <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the servant of the LORD commanded the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as it is written in the book of the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, which he wrote in the presence of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, as well the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, as he that was born among them; half of them over against <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#007">Gerizim</a>, and half of them over against <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#007">Ebal</a>; as <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> There was not a word of all that <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> commanded, which <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> read not before all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.<br>
