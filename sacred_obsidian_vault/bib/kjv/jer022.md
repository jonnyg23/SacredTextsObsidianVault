 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and speak there this word,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that sittest upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; Thou art <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> unto me, and the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>: yet surely I will make thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and cities which are not inhabited.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For thus saith the LORD touching <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which reigned instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But he shall die in the place whither they have led him <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and shall see this land no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</a>, and giveth him not for his work;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>, and painted with vermilion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>? did not thy father eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and do judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>, and then it was well with him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He judged the cause of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>, and for to shed innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He shall be buried with the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</a> of an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, and cry; and lift up thy voice in <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> O inhabitant of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> were the <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</a> upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Is this man Coniah a despised broken <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a>? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and ruling any more in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
