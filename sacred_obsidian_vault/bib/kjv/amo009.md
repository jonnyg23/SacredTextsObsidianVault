 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Amos Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I saw the LORD standing upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>: and he said, Smite the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#000">lintel</a> of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Though they dig into <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, thence will I bring them down:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And though they hide themselves in the top of <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, and he shall bite them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And though they go into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> before their enemies, thence will I command the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>: and it shall rise up wholly like a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>; and shall be drowned, as by the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> It is he that buildeth his stories in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>? and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#008">Caphtor</a>, and the Syrians from <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#007">Kir</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> among all nations, like as <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</a> fall upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> All the sinners of my people shall die by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> In that day will I raise up the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That they may possess the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and of all the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and all the hills shall melt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of my people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> thereof; they shall also make <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a>, and eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.<br>
