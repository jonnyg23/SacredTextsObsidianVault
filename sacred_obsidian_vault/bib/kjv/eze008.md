 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#009">amber</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#009">lock</a> of mine head; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> lifted me up between the earth and the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and brought me in the visions of God to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to the door of the inner <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a>, which provoketh to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was there, according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> that I saw in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</a> at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> this image of <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> in the entry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> committeth here, that I should go far off from my <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a>, with every man his <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</a> in his hand; and a thick <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> went up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#005">imagery</a>? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then he brought me to the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#005">Tammuz</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, between the porch and the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, and their faces toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>; and they worshipped the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>: and, lo, they put the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> to their nose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Therefore will I also deal in <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.<br>
