 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe to the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of pride, to the drunkards of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> valleys of them that are overcome with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> and a destroying storm, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of pride, the drunkards of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, shall be trodden under feet:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and for a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#009">diadem</a> of beauty, unto the residue of his people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And for a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But they also have erred through <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and through strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> are out of the way; the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> have erred through strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, they are swallowed up of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, they are out of the way through strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; they err in <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, they stumble in judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For all <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>, and drawn from the breasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Because ye have said, We have made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with death, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> for a foundation a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, a tried <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, a precious corner <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Judgment also will I lay to the line, and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> to the plummet: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And your <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the LORD shall rise up as in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Give ye <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> When he hath made <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#000">fitches</a>, and scatter the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#009">cummin</a>, and cast in the principal <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> and the appointed <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> and the rie in their place?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#000">fitches</a> are not threshed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#009">threshing</a> instrument, neither is a <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a> turned about upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#009">cummin</a>; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#000">fitches</a> are beaten out with a staff, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#009">cummin</a> with a rod.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">Bread</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> is bruised; because he will not ever be <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#009">threshing</a> it, nor break it with the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</a>, nor bruise it with his horsemen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.<br>
