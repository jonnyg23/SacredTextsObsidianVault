 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> If a man shall steal an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, and four <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> be shed for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> be risen upon him, there shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#006">theft</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> If the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#006">theft</a> be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>; he shall restore double.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, or the standing <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For all manner of trespass, whether it be for <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, for <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, for <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If a man deliver unto his neighbour an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, or an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, or any <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then shall an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If it be torn in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, then let him bring it for <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, and he shall not make good that which was torn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if a man <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#007">borrow</a> ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#009">dowry</a> of virgins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thou shalt not suffer a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#006">witch</a> to live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Whosoever lieth with a <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thou shalt neither vex a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> If thou afflict them in any <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And my wrath shall <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> hot, and I will kill you with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and your wives shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a>, and your children fatherless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> If thou lend money to any of my people that is <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> goeth down:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> the ruler of thy people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.<br>
