 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then fourteen years after I went up again to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a> with me also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I went up by <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</a>, and communicated unto them that <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> which I preach among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But neither <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a>, who was with me, being a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>, was compelled to be circumcised:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, that they might bring us into <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> might continue with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But contrariwise, when they saw that the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> was unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> (For he that wrought effectually in <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> to the apostleship of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, the same was mighty in me toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</a>, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> that was given unto me, they gave to me and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> the right hands of <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a>; that we should go unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and they unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Only they would that we should remember the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>; the same which I also was forward to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For before that certain came from <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, he did eat with the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> also was carried away with their dissimulation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, I said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> before them all, If thou, being a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, livest after the manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> to live as do the Jews?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, even we have believed in <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that we might be justified by the faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> be justified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But if, while we seek to be justified by <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>? God forbid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I am crucified with <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: neverthless I live; yet not I, but <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I do not frustrate the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God: for if <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> come by the law, then <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is dead in vain.<br>
