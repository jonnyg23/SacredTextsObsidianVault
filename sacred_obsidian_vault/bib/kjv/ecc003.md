 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, and a time to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And also that every man should eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And moreover I saw under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, that iniquity was there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I said in mine heart, God shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>: for all is vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> All go unto one place; all are of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and all turn to <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Who knoweth the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of man that goeth upward, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that goeth downward to the earth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<br>
