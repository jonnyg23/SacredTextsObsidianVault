 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And they continued three years without war between <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it came to pass in the third year, that <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> came down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto his servants, Know ye that <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#002">Ramoth</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said, Is there not here a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, There is yet one man, <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> said, Let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> say so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> called an officer, and said, Hasten hither <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> the son of Imlah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> sat each on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</a> made him horns of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> that was gone to call <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So he came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a>, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said, I saw all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> scattered upon the hills, as <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> that have not a <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> standing by him on his right hand and on his left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the LORD said, Who shall persuade <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And there came forth a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</a> went near, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</a>, and said, Which way went the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> to hide thyself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said, Take <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a>, and carry him back unto <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</a> the governor of the city, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> the king's son;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And say, Thus saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Put this fellow in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and feed him with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</a> said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went up to Ramothgilead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> disguised himself, and went into the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, that they said, Surely it is the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. And they turned aside to fight against him: and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> cried out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that they turned back from pursuing him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And a certain man drew a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> at a venture, and smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> between the joints of the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#007">harness</a>: wherefore he said unto the driver of his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>; for I am wounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the battle increased that day: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was stayed up in his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> against the Syrians, and died at even: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> ran out of the wound into the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And there went a proclamation throughout the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> about the going down of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> died, and was brought to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>; and they buried the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And one washed the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> in the pool of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>; and the dogs licked up his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; and they washed his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, and all that he did, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a> house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> slept with his fathers; and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> began to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> in the fourth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#002">Azubah</a> the daughter of Shilhi.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And he walked in all the ways of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> yet in the high places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> made peace with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And the remnant of the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#006">sodomites</a>, which remained in the days of his father <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, he took out of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> There was then no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>: a <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#003">Tharshish</a> to go to <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: but they went not; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> were broken at Eziongeber.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, Let my servants go with thy servants in the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>. But <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> would not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father: and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> began to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> the seventeenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and reigned two years over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, who made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> For he served <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and worshipped him, and provoked to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, according to all that his father had done.<br>
