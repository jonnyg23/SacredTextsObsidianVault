 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> unto me: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> What man soever of the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> with water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> is down, he shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> There shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But if the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If the priest's daughter also be married unto a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, she may not eat of an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the holy things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> eat thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> with the holy thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which they offer unto the LORD;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, and to his sons, and unto all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, or of the strangers in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that will offer his oblation for all his <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Ye shall offer at your own will a male without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#000">beeves</a>, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, or of the goats.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But whatsoever hath a <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And whosoever offereth a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#000">beeves</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a> therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">Blind</a>, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> by fire of them upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Either a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> or a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> thereof in your land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> When a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</a>, is brought forth, then it shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> made by fire unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And whether it be <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#001">cow</a>, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And when ye will offer a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: I am the LORD which <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> you,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> That brought you out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, to be your God: I am the LORD.<br>
