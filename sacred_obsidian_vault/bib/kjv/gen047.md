 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 47</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> came and told <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>; and, behold, they are in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They said morever unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> is sore in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a> let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> brought in <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> his father, and set him before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, How old art thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and went out from before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, in the best of the land, in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#001">Rameses</a>, as <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> had commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, according to their families.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in all the land; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> was very sore, so that the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> and all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> fainted by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> gathered up all the money that was found in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> which they bought: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> brought the money into Pharaoh's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when money failed in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, all the Egyptians came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and said, Give us <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said, Give your <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>; and I will give you for your <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, if money fail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they brought their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> gave them <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> for all their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> for that year.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and we and our land will be servants unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> bought all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> even to the other end thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and did eat their portion which <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> made it a law over the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> unto this day, that <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> dwelt in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> lived in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> seventeen years: so the whole age of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> was an hundred forty and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the time drew nigh that <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> must die: and he called his son <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and said unto him, If now I have found <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> bowed himself upon the bed's head.<br>
