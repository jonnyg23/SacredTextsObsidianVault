 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and preached the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> came upon him with the elders,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The baptism of John, was it from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, or of men?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But and if we say, Of men; all the people will <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> us: for they be persuaded that John was a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then began he to speak to the people this <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a>: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whosoever shall fall upon that <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#006">grind</a> him to powder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they watched him, and sent forth <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</a>, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Is it lawful for us to give <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>, or no?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Shew me a <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</a>. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he said unto them, Render therefore unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a> the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then came to him certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Saying, Master, <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> There were therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the third took her; and in like manner the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> also: and they left no children, and died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Last of all the woman died also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> had her to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Now that the dead are raised, even <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> shewed at the <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</a>, when he calleth the Lord the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Then certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> answering said, Master, thou hast well said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And he said unto them, How say they that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is David's son?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> himself saith in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">Psalms</a>, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Till I make thine enemies thy <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Beware of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</a>.<br>
