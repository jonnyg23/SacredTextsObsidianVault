 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> These words spake <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and lifted up his eyes to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and said, Father, the hour is come; <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> thy Son, that thy Son also may <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As thou hast given him power over all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, whom thou hast sent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And now, O Father, <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> thou me with thine own self with the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> which I had with thee before the world was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> might be fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<br>
