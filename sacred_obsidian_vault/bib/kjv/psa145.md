 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 145</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I will extol thee, my God, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; and I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thy name for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Every day will I <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> One <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, and shall sing of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and of great <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> They shall speak of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thy kingdom is an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> his holy name for ever and ever.<br>
