 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, a servant of God and of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> he shall pass away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, and the flower thereof falleth, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Blessed is the man that endureth <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>: for when he is tried, he shall receive the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a>, and enticed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then when <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a> hath conceived, it bringeth forth <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Do not err, my beloved brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Every good <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> and every perfect <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of turning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the wrath of man worketh not the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</a> the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.<br>
