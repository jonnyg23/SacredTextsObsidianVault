 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A land of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>, and vines, and <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> A land wherein thou shalt eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Who led thee through that great and terrible <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, wherein were fiery serpents, and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</a>, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Who fed thee in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.<br>
