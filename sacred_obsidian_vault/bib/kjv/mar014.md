 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After two days was the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, and of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: and the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But they said, Not on the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> day, lest there be an uproar of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And being in <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a> in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#005">alabaster</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#008">spikenard</a> very precious; and she brake the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</a>, and poured it on his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> made?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>. And they murmured against her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For ye have the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> my body to the burying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a>, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the first day of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, when they killed the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> of water: follow him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> with my disciples?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And as they sat and did eat, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#004">dish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And as they did eat, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he said unto them, This is my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>, which is shed for many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Verily I say unto you, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> no more of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, until that day that I <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it new in the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when they had sung an <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#005">hymn</a>, they went out into the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of Olives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> shall be scattered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>. Likewise also said they all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And they came to a place which was named <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#003">Gethsemane</a>: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he taketh with him <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And he said, <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#007">Abba</a>, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>. The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> truly is ready, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is weak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and the elders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a>, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And one of them that stood by drew a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and smote a servant of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and cut off his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> I was daily with you in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And they all forsook him, and fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And there followed him a certain young man, having a <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> cloth cast about his <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> body; and the young men laid hold on him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> And he left the <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> cloth, and fled from them <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And they led <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> away to the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> followed him afar off, even into the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And the chief priests and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a> sought for <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to put him to death; and found none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> For many bare false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against him, but their <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> agreed not together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> And there arose certain, and bare false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against him, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> We heard him say, I will destroy this <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> But neither so did their <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> agree together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> And the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> stood up in the midst, and asked <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of the Blessed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> Then the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> Ye have heard the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was beneath in the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, there cometh one of the maids of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> And when she saw <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> But he began to <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="072">72</a> And the second time the cock crew. And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> called to mind the word that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.<br>
