 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And as he went out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings?  there shall not be left one <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> upon another, that shall not be thrown down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And as he sat upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of Olives over against the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> and John and <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a> asked him privately,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; and shall deceive many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> must first be published among all nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But when ye shall see the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of desolation, spoken of by <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</a> which God created unto this time, neither shall be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, he hath shortened the days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But in those days, after that <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shall be darkened, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> shall not give her light,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> shall fall, and the powers that are in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> shall be shaken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a>, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Now learn a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree; When her <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Verily I say unto you, that this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> shall not pass, till all these things be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">Heaven</a> and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, neither the Son, but the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</a> to watch.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.<br>
