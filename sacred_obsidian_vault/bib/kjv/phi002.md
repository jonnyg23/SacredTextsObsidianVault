 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Philippians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> If there be therefore any consolation in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, if any comfort of love, if any <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, if any <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> and mercies,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Let this mind be in you, which was also in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</a> to be equal with God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> That at the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> every knee should <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, of things in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And that every tongue should confess that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is Lord, to the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> with fear and trembling.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Do all things without murmurings and disputings:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Yea, and if I be offered upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But I trust in the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to send <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For all seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> Christ's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#001">Epaphroditus</a>, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a>, and he that ministered to my wants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Because for the work of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.<br>
