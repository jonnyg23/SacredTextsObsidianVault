 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After these things, when the wrath of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> was appeased, he remembered <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a>, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</a>, keeper of the women; and let their things for <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</a> be given them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And let the maiden which pleaseth the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> be <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a>. And the thing pleased the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; and he did so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now in <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> there was a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#001">Jair</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a>, a Benjamite;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who had been carried away from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> which had been carried away with Jeconiah <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had carried away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he brought up <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#006">Hadassah</a>, that is, <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a>, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, to the custody of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#005">Hegai</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#005">Hegai</a>, keeper of the women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</a>, with such things as belonged to her, and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> had charged her that she should not shew it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> did, and what should become of her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then thus came every maiden unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#009">Shaashgaz</a>, the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</a>, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> no more, except the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> delighted in her, and that she were called by name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now when the turn of <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#003">Abihail</a> the uncle of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, she required nothing but what <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#005">Hegai</a> the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</a>, the keeper of the women, appointed. And <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> was taken unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month <a href="../ebd/ebd360.htm#000">Tebeth</a>, in the seventh year of his reign.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> loved <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> above all the women, and she obtained <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> upon her head, and made her <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made a great <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> sat in the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> had charged her: for <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> did the commandment of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, like as when she was brought up with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> In those days, while <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a> sat in the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, two of the king's chamberlains, <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#005">Bigthan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#004">Teresh</a>, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the thing was known to <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</a>, who told it unto <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</a> certified the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof in Mordecai's name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
