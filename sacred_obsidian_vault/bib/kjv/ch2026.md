 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then all the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a>, who was sixteen years old, and made him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in the room of his father <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He built Eloth, and restored it to <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, after that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> slept with his fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Sixteen years old was <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. His mother's name also was <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#005">Jecoliah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he sought God in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</a>, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he went forth and warred against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and brake down the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, and the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#002">Jabneh</a>, and the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a>, and built cities about <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</a>, and among the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And God helped him against the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#009">Mehunims</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the Ammonites gave gifts to <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a>: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> built <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> at the corner <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and at the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Also he built <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>, and digged many wells: for he had much <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> dressers in the mountains, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>: for he loved husbandry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> had an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of fighting men, that went out to war by <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>, according to the number of their account by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#000">Jeiel</a> the scribe and <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a> the ruler, under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>, one of the king's captains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> against the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> prepared for them throughout all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he made in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#000">engines</a>, invented by cunning men, to be on the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a> and upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#005">bulwarks</a>, to shoot <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they withstood <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a>, to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, that are consecrated to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>: go out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> was wroth, and had a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</a> in his hand to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>: and while he was wroth with the priests, the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a> even rose up in his <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</a> before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</a>, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a>, first and last, did <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</a>, write.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</a> which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
