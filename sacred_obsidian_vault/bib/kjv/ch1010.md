 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> fled from before the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and fell down slain in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> followed hard after <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and after his sons; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> slew <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</a>, and Malchishua, the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the battle went sore against <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to his armourbearer, Draw thy <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> took a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and fell upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when his armourbearer saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was dead, he fell likewise on the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> saw that they fled, and that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> came and dwelt in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> came to strip the slain, that they found <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and his sons fallen in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, and sent into the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they put his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a> in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a>, and buried their bones under the <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</a>, and fasted <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, to enquire of it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>.<br>
