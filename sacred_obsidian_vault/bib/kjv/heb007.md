 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For this Melchisedec, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#001">Salem</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of the most high God, who met <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> To whom also <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and after that also <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#001">Salem</a>, which is, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of peace;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#009">patriarch</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> gave the tenth of the spoils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And verily they that are of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and blessed him that had the promises.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And as I may so say, <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a> also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</a> were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>, of which no man gave attendance at the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</a>; of which <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake nothing concerning priesthood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Who is made, not after the law of a <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</a> commandment, but after the power of an endless life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For he testifieth, Thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And inasmuch as not without an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> he was made <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> (For those priests were made without an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>; but this with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> By so much was <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> of a better <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For such an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.<br>
