 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and captains of hundreds over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and a third part under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a>, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> stood by the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a>, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>. And all the people heard when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> gave all the captains charge concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So the people went out into the field against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and the battle was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Where the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were slain before the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> devoured more people that day than the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> devoured.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> met the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> rode upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</a> went under the thick boughs of a great <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>, and his head caught hold of the <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>, and he was taken up between the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the earth; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</a> that was under him went away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And a certain man saw it, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and said, Behold, I saw <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> hanged in an <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the man said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> charged thee and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</a>, saying, Beware that none touch the young man <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, while he was yet alive in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And ten young men that bare Joab's <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a> compassed about and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, and slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> held back the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they took <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, and cast him into a great <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and laid a very great <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> of stones upon him: and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> fled every one to his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a>, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a>, Let me now run, and bear the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> to Cushi, Go tell the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and ran.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> yet again to <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> ran by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>, and overran Cushi.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the watchman cried, and told the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</a>, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, He also bringeth tidings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> called, and said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Is the young man <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> safe? And <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> answered, When <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto Cushi, Is the young man <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was much moved, and went up to the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> over the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, my son, my son <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>! would God I had died for thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, my son, my son!<br>
