 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 100</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of his pasture.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For the LORD is good; his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>; and his truth endureth to all generations.<br>
