 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> As <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> in summer, and as <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, so honour is not seemly for a fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As the <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#008">wandering</a>, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</a> by flying, so the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> causeless shall not come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A whip for the horse, a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</a> for the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and a rod for the fool's back.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in his own conceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> in the mouth of fools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> As he that bindeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> in a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#005">sling</a>, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> As a <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</a> goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> in the mouths of fools.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Seest thou a man <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The slothful hideth his hand in his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> men that can render a reason.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> As a mad man who casteth firebrands, <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a>, and death,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Where no <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> As coals are to burning coals, and <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#004">potsherd</a> covered with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> abominations in his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Whose <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a> is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Whoso diggeth a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, it will return upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.<br>
