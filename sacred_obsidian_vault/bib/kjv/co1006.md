 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Do ye not know that the saints shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the smallest matters?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Know ye not that we shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> who are least esteemed in the church.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man among you? no, not one that shall be able to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> between his brethren?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Meats for the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>? shall I then take the members of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and make them the members of an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>? God forbid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a> is one body?  for two, saith he, shall be one <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Flee <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>. Every <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a> sinneth against his own body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> What? know ye not that your body is the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For ye are bought with a price: therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> God in your body, and in your <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, which are God's.<br>
