 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Ye know that after two days is the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, and the elders of the people, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, who was called <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And consulted that they might take <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> by subtilty, and kill him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But they said, Not on the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> day, lest there be an uproar among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was in <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</a>, in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> the leper,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> There came unto him a woman having an <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#005">alabaster</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</a> of very precious <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For this <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> might have been sold for much, and given to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For ye have the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> always with you; but me ye have not always.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For in that she hath poured this <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a> on my body, she did it for my <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then one of the twelve, called <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a>, went unto the chief priests,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now the first day of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> the disciples came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> at thy house with my disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the disciples did as <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had appointed them; and they made ready the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#004">dish</a>, the same shall betray me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And as they were <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</a> ye all of it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For this is my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But I say unto you, I will not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> henceforth of this <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, until that day when I <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when they had sung an <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#005">hymn</a>, they went out into the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of Olives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then saith <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Then cometh <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> with them unto a place called <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#003">Gethsemane</a>, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And he took with him <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and the two sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a>, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>: the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> indeed is willing, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is weak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> may not pass away from me, except I <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it, thy will be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And while he yet spake, lo, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a>, that same is he: hold him <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And forthwith he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</a>, master; and kissed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> and took him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And, behold, one of them which were with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stretched out his hand, and drew his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto him, Put up again thy <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> into his place: for all they that take the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall perish with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> In that same hour said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and ye laid no hold on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> And they that had laid hold on <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> led him away to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a> the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, where the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and the elders were assembled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> followed him afar off unto the high priest's <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, sought false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, to put him to death;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of God, and to build it in three days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> And the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> held his peace, And the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> Then the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, saying, He hath spoken <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, Who is he that smote thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> sat without in the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="072">72</a> And again he denied with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>, I do not know the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="073">73</a> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="074">74</a> Then began he to <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="075">75</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> remembered the word of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<br>
