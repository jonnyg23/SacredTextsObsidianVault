 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 30</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The words of <a href="../ebd/ebd012.htm#009">Agur</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#003">Jakeh</a>, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#003">Ucal</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who hath ascended up into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Every word of God is pure: he is a <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> unto them that put their trust in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> thee, and thou be found guilty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> that curseth their father, and doth not <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> their mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> from off the earth, and the needy from among men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The way of an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a> in the air; the way of a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For an odious woman when she is married; and an <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a> that is <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> to her mistress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The locusts have no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, yet go they forth all of them by <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#006">spider</a> taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#005">greyhound</a>; an he <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</a> also; and a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, against whom there is no rising up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Surely the churning of <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> bringeth forth <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</a>, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.<br>
