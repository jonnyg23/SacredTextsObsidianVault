 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Every <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> shall preserve them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Where no oxen are, the crib is <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>: but much increase is by the strength of the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> will not lie: but a false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> will utter lies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Fools make a mock at <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>: but among the righteous there is favour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> doth not intermeddle with his joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the upright shall flourish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The evil <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, happy is he.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Do they not err that devise evil? but <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> and truth shall be to them that devise good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> A true <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> delivereth souls: but a deceitful <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> speaketh lies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The fear of the LORD is a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> exalteth folly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> A sound heart is the life of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: but envy the rottenness of the bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> He that oppresseth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">Righteousness</a> exalteth a nation: but <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is a reproach to any people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> The king's favour is toward a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.<br>
