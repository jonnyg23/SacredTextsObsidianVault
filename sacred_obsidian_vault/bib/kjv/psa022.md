 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</a>, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#002">lip</a>, they shake the head, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a> have beset me round.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a>; it is melted in the midst of my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> My strength is dried up like a <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#004">potsherd</a>; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Deliver my soul from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; my <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#000">darling</a> from the power of the dog.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> will I praise thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> him; and fear him, all ye the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> My praise shall be of thee in the great <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>: I will pay my <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a> before them that fear him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> All they that be <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> upon earth shall eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>: all they that go down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> They shall come, and shall declare his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.<br>
