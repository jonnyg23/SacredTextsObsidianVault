 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>, (this is <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> which reigned, from <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#003">India</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a>, over an hundred and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> and twenty provinces:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That in those days, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> sat on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of his kingdom, which was in <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> In the third year of his reign, he made a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> unto all his princes and his servants; the power of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#001">Media</a>, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when these days were expired, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> unto all the people that were present in <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, both unto great and small, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, in the court of the garden of the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Where were white, green, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a>, hangings, fastened with cords of fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> and purple to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> rings and pillars of <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#006">marble</a>: the beds were of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#003">pavement</a> of red, and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a>, and white, and black, <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#006">marble</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they gave them <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> in vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> in abundance, according to the state of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> for the women in the royal house which belonged to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> On the seventh day, when the heart of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was merry with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, he commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#008">Mehuman</a>, Biztha, <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#008">Harbona</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#004">Bigtha</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#004">Abagtha</a>, Zethar, and Carcas, the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> chamberlains that served in the presence of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> To bring <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> very wroth, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> burned in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the next unto him was Carshena, <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#005">Shethar</a>, Admatha, <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</a>, Meres, Marsena, and <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#000">Memucan</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#001">Media</a>, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> What shall we do unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> by the chamberlains?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#000">Memucan</a> answered before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and the princes, <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> hath not done wrong to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For this deed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a> commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> to be brought in before him, but she came not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Likewise shall the ladies of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#001">Media</a> say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> If it please the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</a> come no more before <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</a>; and let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the saying pleased the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and the princes; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> did according to the word of <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#000">Memucan</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.<br>
