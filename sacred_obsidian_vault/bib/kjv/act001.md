 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The former treatise have I made, O <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#008">Theophilus</a>, of all that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> began both to do and teach,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> To whom also he shewed himself alive after his <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#004">passion</a> by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> not many days hence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</a>, which the Father hath put in his own power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and in all Judaea, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> received him out of their sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And while they looked stedfastly toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Which also said, Ye men of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, why stand ye gazing up into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>? this same <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, which is taken up from you into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then returned they unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> from the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> called Olivet, which is from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day's <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>, and John, and <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#009">Bartholomew</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#003">Matthew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#005">Alphaeus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#003">Zelotes</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> These all continued with one accord in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and supplication, with the women, and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and with his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And in those days <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Men and brethren, this <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> by the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> spake before concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a>, which was guide to them that took <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> gushed out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it was known unto all the dwellers at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#003">Aceldama</a>, that is to say, The field of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For it is written in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">Psalms</a>, Let his <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went in and out among us,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> with us of his resurrection.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they appointed two, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#008">Barsabas</a>, who was surnamed <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#000">Justus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#005">Matthias</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#005">Matthias</a>; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.<br>
