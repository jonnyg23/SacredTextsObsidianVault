 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> passed on by hundreds, and by <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men passed on in the <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#004">rereward</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then said the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, What do these <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> here?  And <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> said unto the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, Is not this <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, the servant of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> were wroth with him; and the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Is not this <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> slew his <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a>, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</a> answered and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God: notwithstanding the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>.<br>
