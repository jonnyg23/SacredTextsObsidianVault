 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> A virtuous woman is a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> A righteous man regardeth the life of his <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The wicked desireth the <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> A man shall be satisfied with good by the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that speaketh truth sheweth forth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: but a false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> deceit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There is that speaketh like the piercings of a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>: but the tongue of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> is health.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#002">lip</a> of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Lying lips are <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#008">hunting</a>: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> In the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.<br>
