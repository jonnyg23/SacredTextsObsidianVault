 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> So when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was old and full of days, he made <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> his son <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he gathered together all the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, with the priests and the Levites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, to praise therewith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> divided them into <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a> among the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, namely, <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#009">Gershon</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#001">Kohath</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#000">Merari</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The sons of Laadan; the chief was <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#003">Jehiel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd392.htm#000">Zetham</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#005">Joel</a>, three.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>; Shelomith, and Haziel, and <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</a>, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> were, <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#004">Jahath</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#001">Zina</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#003">Jeush</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#005">Beriah</a>. These four were the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#004">Jahath</a> was the chief, and <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#002">Zizah</a> the second: but <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#003">Jeush</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#005">Beriah</a> had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#001">Kohath</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd022.htm#001">Amram</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#001">Izhar</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#005">Uzziel</a>, four.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd022.htm#001">Amram</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> before the LORD, to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> unto him, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> in his name for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the man of God, his sons were named of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> were, <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#008">Gershom</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#007">Eliezer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#008">Gershom</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#000">Shebuel</a> was the chief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#007">Eliezer</a> were, <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#005">Rehabiah</a> the chief. And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#007">Eliezer</a> had none other sons; but the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#005">Rehabiah</a> were very many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#001">Izhar</a>; Shelomith the chief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>; Jeriah the first, <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#002">Amariah</a> the second, <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#006">Jahaziel</a> the third, and Jekameam the fourth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#005">Uzziel</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</a> the first and Jesiah the second.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#000">Merari</a>; Mahli, and <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#005">Mushi</a>. The sons of Mahli; <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a> took them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#005">Mushi</a>; Mahli, and <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#000">Eder</a>, and Jeremoth, three.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> These were the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a> after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, The LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for ever:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For by the last words of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Because their office was to wait on the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Both for the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>, and for the fine <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a> for meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#009">pan</a>, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And that they should keep the charge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.<br>
