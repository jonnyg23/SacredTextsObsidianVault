 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>. But her father would not suffer him to go in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, though I do them a displeasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#007">firebrand</a> in the midst between two tails.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, with the vineyards and olives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> said, Who hath done this? And they answered, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a>, the son in law of the <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#009">Timnite</a>, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#008">Etam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went up, and pitched in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and spread themselves in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#009">Lehi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then three thousand men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went to the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd125.htm#008">Etam</a>, and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a>, Knowest thou not that the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when he came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#009">Lehi</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> shouted against him: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a> that was burnt with fire, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> loosed from off his hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he found a new jawbone of an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</a> said, With the jawbone of an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> have I slain a thousand men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a>, his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#009">Lehi</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he judged <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in the days of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> twenty years.<br>
