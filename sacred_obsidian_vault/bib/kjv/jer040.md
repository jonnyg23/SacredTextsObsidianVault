 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 40</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD, after that <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> had let him go from <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which were carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a>, whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> hath made governor over the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then went <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now when all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had made <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the land, of them that were not carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#006">Tanhumeth</a>, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a> sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and it shall be well with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As for me, behold, I will dwell at <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Likewise when all the Jews that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and among the Ammonites, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and that were in all the countries, heard that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had left a remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and that he had set over them <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, and gathered <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> and summer fruits very much.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, and all the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> that were in the fields, came to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#008">Baalis</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the Ammonites hath sent <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a> to slay thee? But <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> believed them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a> spake to <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a> secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> perish?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</a>, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>.<br>
