 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joel Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Blow ye the trumpet in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and sound an <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</a> in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> A day of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a> before them, and behind them a desolate <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; yea, and nothing shall escape them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, they shall not be wounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> shall be dark, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> shall withdraw their shining:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD your God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Blow the trumpet in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, sanctify a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, call a solemn assembly:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Gather the people, sanctify the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> out of her <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#000">closet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> and desolate, with his face toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> do spring, for the tree beareth her <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree and the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> do yield their strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Be glad then, ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, the former <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and the latter <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> in the first month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the floors shall be full of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and the vats shall overflow with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> and oil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And I will restore to you the years that the <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</a> hath eaten, the <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#004">cankerworm</a>, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And ye shall know that I am in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> upon all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> dreams, your young men shall see visions:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and fire, and pillars of smoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shall be turned into <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> and in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.<br>
