 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 64</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a>, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</a>; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thy holy cities are a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> is a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> a desolation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?<br>
