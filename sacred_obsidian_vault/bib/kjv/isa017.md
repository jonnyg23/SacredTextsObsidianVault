 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>. Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#001">Aroer</a> are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The fortress also shall cease from <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and the kingdom from <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, and the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>: they shall be as the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And in that day it shall come to pass, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> shall be made thin, and the fatness of his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> lean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#000">Rephaim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a>, which they left because of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and there shall be desolation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, and hast not been mindful of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a> shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a> in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The nations shall <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#007">rush</a> like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.<br>
