 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it shall be, as with the people, so with the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>, so with the giver of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a> to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> mourneth, the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a> ceaseth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They shall not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> with a song; strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a> to them that <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is a crying for <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> In the city is left desolation, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> is smitten with <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in the isles of the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Fear, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> shall be taken in the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a>: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#001">cottage</a>; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, and shall be shut up in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and after many days shall they be visited.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> shall be confounded, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and before his ancients gloriously.<br>
