 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> saw that it pleased the LORD to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, he went not, as at other times, to seek for <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</a>, but he set his face toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> lifted up his eyes, and he saw <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of God came upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he took up his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#009">Beor</a> hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of the Almighty, falling into a <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</a>, but having his eyes open:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> How goodly are thy tents, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and thy tabernacles, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As the valleys are they spread forth, as <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a> by the river's side, as the trees of lign <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#004">aloes</a> which the LORD hath planted, and as <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> trees beside the waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall be higher than <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#008">Agag</a>, and his kingdom shall be exalted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> God brought him forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; he hath as it were the strength of an <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#007">unicorn</a>: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And Balak's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled against <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and he smote his hands together: and <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, I called thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> would give me his house full of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he took up his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#009">Beor</a> hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of the Almighty, falling into a <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</a>, but having his eyes open:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">Sceptre</a> shall rise out of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and shall smite the corners of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and destroy all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#004">Sheth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> shall be a possession, <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> also shall be a possession for his enemies; and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall do valiantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Out of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when he looked on <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#009">Amalek</a>, he took up his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#009">Amalek</a> was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he looked on the <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#004">Kenites</a>, and took up his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#002">Asshur</a> shall carry thee away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he took up his <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> shall come from the coast of <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#003">Chittim</a>, and shall afflict <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#002">Asshur</a>, and shall afflict <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#001">Eber</a>, and he also shall perish for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> rose up, and went and returned to his place: and <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> also went his way.<br>
