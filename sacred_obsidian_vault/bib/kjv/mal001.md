 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Malachi Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of the word of the LORD to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#008">Malachi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I hated <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Whereas <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Ye offer polluted <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> upon mine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And if ye offer the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who is there even among you that would shut the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> at your hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For from the rising of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>; and in every place <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> shall be offered unto my name, and a pure <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>: for my name shall be great among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>.<br>
