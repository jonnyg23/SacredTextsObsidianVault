 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 38</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass at that time, that <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#008">Adullamite</a>, whose name was Hirah.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> saw there a daughter of a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#006">Shuah</a>; and he took her, and went in unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#008">Onan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</a>: and he was at <a href="../ebd/ebd080.htm#000">Chezib</a>, when she bare him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#008">Onan</a>, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#008">Onan</a> knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</a> my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> went and dwelt in her father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And in process of time the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#006">Shuah</a> Judah's wife died; and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a>, he and his friend Hirah the <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#008">Adullamite</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a>, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a> to shear his <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</a>; for she saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</a> was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> saw her, he thought her to be an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>; because she had covered her face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a>, till thou send it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he said, What <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> shall I give thee? And she said, Thy <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</a>, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> sent the kid by the hand of his friend the <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#008">Adullamite</a>, to receive his <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</a> from the woman's hand: but he found her not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a> in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a> in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</a> thy daughter in law hath played the <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</a>, and bracelets, and staff.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</a> my son. And he knew her again no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#009">midwife</a> took and bound upon his hand a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> thread, saying, This came out first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> be upon thee: therefore his name was called <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#007">Pharez</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And afterward came out his brother, that had the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.<br>
