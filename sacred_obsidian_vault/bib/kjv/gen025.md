 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 25</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then again <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> took a wife, and her name was <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#001">Keturah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And she bare him <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#008">Zimran</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#003">Jokshan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd245.htm#008">Medan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#001">Ishbak</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#006">Shuah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#003">Jokshan</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#005">Dedan</a>. And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#005">Dedan</a> were Asshurim, and Letushim, and <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#005">Leummim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">Ephah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#004">Epher</a>, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#001">Keturah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> gave all that he had unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But unto the sons of the concubines, which <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> had, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> gave gifts, and sent them away from <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And his sons <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a> buried him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#007">Machpelah</a>, in the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#006">Zohar</a> the Hittite, which is before <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The field which <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> purchased of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>: there was <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> buried, and <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, that God blessed his son <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> dwelt by the well Lahairoi.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now these are the generations of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, Abraham's son, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#005">Hagar</a> the Egyptian, Sarah's <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>, bare unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And these are the names of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, Nebajoth; and <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd008.htm#003">Adbeel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#003">Mibsam</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd257.htm#000">Mishma</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#001">Dumah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd243.htm#005">Massa</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#003">Hadar</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#000">Tema</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#001">Jetur</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#005">Naphish</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd216.htm#004">Kedemah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> These are the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And these are the years of the life of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</a>, an hundred and thirty and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years: and he gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a> and died; and was gathered unto his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they dwelt from <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#009">Havilah</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd342.htm#002">Shur</a>, that is before <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, as thou goest toward <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And these are the generations of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, Abraham's son: <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was forty years old when he took <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> to wife, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a> the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</a> the Syrian.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>: and the LORD was intreated of him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> his wife conceived.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> shall serve the younger.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was threescore years old when she bare them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the boys grew: and <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> was a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> man, dwelling in tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> loved <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>, because he did eat of his venison: but <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> loved <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> sod <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#005">pottage</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> came from the field, and he was faint:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#005">pottage</a>; for I am faint: therefore was his name called <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said, Sell me this day thy <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#004">birthright</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#004">birthright</a> do to me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#004">birthright</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> gave <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#005">pottage</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#001">lentiles</a>; and he did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and rose up, and went his way: thus <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> despised his <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#004">birthright</a>.<br>
