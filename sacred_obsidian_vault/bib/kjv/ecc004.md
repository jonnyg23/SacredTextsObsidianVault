 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">comforter</a>; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">comforter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</a> is not quickly broken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Better is a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> child than an old and foolish <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, who will no more be admonished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For out of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I considered all the living which walk under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
