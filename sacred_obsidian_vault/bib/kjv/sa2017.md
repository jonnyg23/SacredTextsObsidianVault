 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> this night:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> only:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the saying pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> well, and all the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, Call now <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#006">Archite</a> also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> spake unto him, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>, The counsel that <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> hath given is not good at this time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For, said <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a>, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> with the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, he is hid now in some <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore I counsel that all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be generally gathered unto thee, from <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> even to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> found there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> and all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said, The counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd029.htm#006">Archite</a> is better than the counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a>. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a>, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> and to <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</a> the priests, Thus and thus did <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> counsel <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> and the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and thus and thus have I counselled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now therefore send quickly, and tell <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">Lodge</a> not this night in the plains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, but speedily pass over; lest the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a>: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#009">Bahurim</a>, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> thereon; and the thing was not known.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> counselled against you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</a> saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> of his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> passed over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, he and all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>: which <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#002">Abigail</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a>, sister to <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a> Joab's mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> pitched in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd340.htm#005">Shobi</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#006">Machir</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#006">Ammiel</a> of Lodebar, and <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</a> the Gileadite of <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#003">Rogelim</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a>, and parched <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#008">beans</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#001">lentiles</a>, and parched <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#004">pulse</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#005">cheese</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
