 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In those days was <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> sick unto death. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</a> came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> wept sore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass, afore <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Turn again, and tell <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father, I have heard thy <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a>, and he recovered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a>, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> answered, It is a light thing for the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> return backward ten degrees.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> cried unto the LORD: and he brought the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#000">dial</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#004">Baladan</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, sent letters and a present unto <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>: for he had heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> had been sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, and the precious <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</a>, and all the house of his <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> shewed them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then came <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> said, They are come from a far country, even from <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, Hear the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</a>, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#009">conduit</a>, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> slept with his fathers: and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
