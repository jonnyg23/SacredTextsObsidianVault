 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he spake a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Saying, There was in a city a <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, which feared not God, neither regarded man:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> saith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he spake this <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Two men went up into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</a>, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> enter therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, Honour thy father and thy mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and thou shalt have treasure in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and come, follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For it is easier for a <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#000">camel</a> to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For he shall be delivered unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>, a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> man sat by the way side begging:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And they told him, that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a> passeth by.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And he cried, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, thou son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.<br>
