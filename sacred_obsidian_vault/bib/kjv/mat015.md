 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, which were of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Why do thy disciples transgress the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a> of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Ye hypocrites, well did <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> prophesy of you, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But in vain they do <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> were offended, after they heard this saying?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Let them alone: they be <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> leaders of the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>. And if the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> lead the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, both shall fall into the ditch.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and said unto him, Declare unto us this <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, Are ye also yet without understanding?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, and is cast out into the draught?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, blasphemies:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went thence, and departed into the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And, behold, a woman of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on me, O Lord, thou son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; my daughter is grievously vexed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and to cast it to dogs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a>, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> to see: and they glorified the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, as to fill so great a multitude?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</a>, and a few little fishes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> baskets full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#004">Magdala</a>.<br>
