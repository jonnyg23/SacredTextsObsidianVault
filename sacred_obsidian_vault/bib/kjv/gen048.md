 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 48</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after these things, that one told <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And one told <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and said, Behold, thy son <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> cometh unto thee: and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, God Almighty appeared unto me at <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, and blessed me,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And now thy two sons, <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, which were born unto thee in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> before I came unto thee into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, are mine; as <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a>, they shall be mine.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And as for me, when I came from <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#003">Padan</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> died by me in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now the eyes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> took them both, <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> was the firstborn.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he blessed <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and said, God, before whom my fathers <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">Angel</a> which redeemed me from all evil, <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a>, saying, God make thee as <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and as <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>: and he set <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> before <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and with my <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>.<br>
