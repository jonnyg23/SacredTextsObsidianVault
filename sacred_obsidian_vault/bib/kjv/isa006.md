 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the year that <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> died I saw also the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> upon a <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, high and lifted up, and his train filled the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>, the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#003">coal</a> in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> purged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Make the heart of this people <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.<br>
