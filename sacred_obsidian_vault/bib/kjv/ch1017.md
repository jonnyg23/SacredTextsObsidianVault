 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass, as <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sat in his house, that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD remaineth under curtains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Go and tell <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto this day; but have gone from <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and from one <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> to another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Wheresoever I have walked with all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, spake I a word to any of the judges of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Also I will ordain a place for my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> shall be established for evermore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> According to all these words, and according to all this <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, so did <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> What can <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, even a God to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and let the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy servant be established before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> unto thy servant:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Now therefore let it please thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.<br>
