 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of Olives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And early in the morning he came again into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> brought unto him a woman taken in <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>; and when they had set her in the midst,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, in the very act.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> among you, let him first cast a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> at her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> She said, No man, Lord. And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then spake <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, but shall have the light of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Ye <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> no man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And yet if I <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> It is also written in your law, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of two men is true.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I am one that bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> These words spake <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</a>, as he taught in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I have many things to say and to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> As he spake these words, many believed on him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> They answered and said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> is our father. <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>; we have one Father, even God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Ye are of your father the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Which of you convinceth me of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, I have not a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And I seek not mine own <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Art thou greater than our father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Your father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> was, I am.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> hid himself, and went out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<br>
