 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Colossians Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> by the will of God, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> our brother,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> To the saints and <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> brethren in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> which are at Colosse: <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, praying always for you,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Since we heard of your faith in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For the hope which is laid up for you in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God in truth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> As ye also learned of <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#000">Epaphras</a> our dear fellowservant, who is for you a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Who also declared unto us your love in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Who hath delivered us from the power of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> In whom we have <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> through his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, even the forgiveness of sins:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For by him were all things created, that are in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For it pleased the Father that in him should all <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> dwell;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And, having made peace through the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> In the body of his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> which is under <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; whereof I <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> am made a <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> in my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> for his body's sake, which is the church:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whereof I am made a <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>, according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#006">dispensation</a> of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Even the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of this <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>; which is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> in you, the hope of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.<br>
