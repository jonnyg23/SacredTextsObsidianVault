 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>, and burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to graven images.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I taught <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I drew them with cords of a man, with <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of love: and I was to them as they that take off the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He shall not return into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and the Assyrian shall be his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, because they refused to return.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> How shall I give thee up, <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>? how shall I deliver thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?  how shall I make thee as <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#003">Admah</a>? how shall I set thee as <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#009">Zeboim</a>? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I will not execute the fierceness of mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, I will not return to destroy <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> They shall tremble as a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and as a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a> out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> compasseth me about with lies, and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with deceit: but <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> yet ruleth with God, and is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> with the saints.<br>
