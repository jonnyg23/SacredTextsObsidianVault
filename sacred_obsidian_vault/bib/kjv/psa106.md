 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 106</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> at all times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That I may see the good of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> with thine inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But lusted exceedingly in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and tempted God in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> They envied <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> also in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> the saint of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The earth opened and swallowed up <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#002">Dathan</a> and covered the company of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#003">Abiram</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> They made a <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</a>, and worshipped the molten image.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thus they changed their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> into the similitude of an <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> that eateth <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> They forgat God their <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</a>, which had done great things in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Wondrous works in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a>, and terrible things by the Red sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> his <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> stood before him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a>, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Thus they provoked him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their inventions: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> brake in upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then stood up <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>, and executed judgment: and so the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> was stayed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And that was counted unto him for <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> unto all generations for evermore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> for their sakes:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Because they provoked his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But were mingled among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and learned their works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And they served their idols: which were a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And shed innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>: and the land was polluted with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And he gave them into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>; and they that hated them ruled over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And he remembered for them his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Blessed be the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>: and let all the people say, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>. Praise ye the LORD.<br>
