 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to my lips.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> All the words of my mouth are in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They are all <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Receive my instruction, and not <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; and knowledge rather than choice <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> By me kings reign, and princes decree <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> is better than <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, yea, than fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; and my revenue than choice <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I lead in the way of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, in the midst of the paths of judgment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> I was set up from <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Hear instruction, and be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and refuse it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.<br>
