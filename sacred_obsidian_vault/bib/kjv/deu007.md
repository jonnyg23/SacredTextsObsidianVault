 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and the Girgashites, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> nations greater and mightier than thou;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them, nor shew <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> unto them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> God, which keepeth <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> which he sware unto thy fathers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he will love thee, and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and multiply thee: he will also <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of thy womb, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of thy land, thy <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and thine oil, the increase of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a>, and the flocks of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> among you, or among your <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and unto all <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Moreover the LORD thy God will send the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#004">hornet</a> among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, until they be destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Neither shalt thou bring an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.<br>
