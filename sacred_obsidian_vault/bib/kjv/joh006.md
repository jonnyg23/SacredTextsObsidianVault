 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After these things <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went over the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, which is the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#006">Tiberias</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the Jews, was nigh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, Whence shall we buy <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, that these may eat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> One of his disciples, <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> Peter's brother, saith unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> There is a lad here, which hath five <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then those men, when they had seen the <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> did, said, This is of a truth that <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> that should come into the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>. And it was now dark, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was not come to them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> (Howbeit there came other boats from <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#006">Tiberias</a> nigh unto the place where they did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, after that the Lord had given thanks:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> When the people therefore saw that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>, seeking for <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</a>, when camest thou hither?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Our fathers did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>; as it is written, He gave them <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> gave you not that <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; but my Father giveth you the true <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of God is he which cometh down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and giveth life unto the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, I am the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> cast out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> For I came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life: and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And they said, Is not this <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> I am that <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Your fathers did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and are dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which cometh down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> I am the living <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: if any man eat of this <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, he shall live for ever: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> that I will give is my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, which I will give for the life of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to eat?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of the Son of man, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, ye have no life in you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> Whoso eateth my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and drinketh my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> For my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is meat indeed, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> indeed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> He that eateth my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and drinketh my <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, dwelleth in me, and I in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> This is that <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: not as your fathers did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, and are dead: he that eateth of this <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> shall live for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> These things said he in the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, as he taught in <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> It is the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that quickeneth; the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and they are life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> But there are some of you that believe not. For <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> And we believe and are sure that thou art that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, Have not I <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> you twelve, and one of you is a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> He spake of <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.<br>
