 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> Shishak <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> came up against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, because they had transgressed against the LORD,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; the <a href="../ebd/ebd232.htm#004">Lubims</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#000">Sukkiims</a>, and the Ethiopians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he took the fenced cities which pertained to <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then came <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a>, and to the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that were gathered together to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whereupon the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a>, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> by the hand of Shishak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So Shishak <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> came up against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Instead of which <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> made shields of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, that kept the entrance of the king's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> entered into the house of the LORD, the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> came and fetched them, and brought them again into the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> things went well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> strengthened himself in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and reigned: for <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the city which the LORD had <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> out of all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to put his name there. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#008">Naamah</a> an Ammonitess.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a>, first and last, are they not written in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#005">Iddo</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a> concerning genealogies? And there were wars between <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#006">Abijah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
