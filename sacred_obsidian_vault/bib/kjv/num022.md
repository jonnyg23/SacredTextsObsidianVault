 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> set forward, and pitched in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> on this side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</a> saw all that <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had done to the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> was distressed because of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> said unto the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> licketh up the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> of the field. And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the Moabites at that time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He sent messengers therefore unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#009">Beor</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#006">Pethor</a>, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Come now therefore, I pray thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> and the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a> departed with the rewards of <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a> in their hand; and they came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and spake unto him the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he said unto them, <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">Lodge</a> here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> abode with <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And God came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and said, What men are these with thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> said unto God, <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, hath sent unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, there is a people come out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And God said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> the people: for they are blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> rose up, and they went unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> refuseth to come with us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and said to him, Thus saith <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</a>, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> me this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> answered and said unto the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>, If <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> would give me his house full of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And God came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> rose up in the morning, and saddled his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and went with the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And God's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled because he went: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD stood in the way for an <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> against him. Now he was riding upon his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and his two servants were with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD standing in the way, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> drawn in his hand: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, to turn her into the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD, she fell down under <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>: and Balaam's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was kindled, and he smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> with a staff.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the LORD opened the mouth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and she said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, Am not I thine <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then the LORD opened the eyes of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and he saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD standing in the way, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> went with the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, which is in the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a>, which is in the utmost coast.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> went with <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a>, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> offered oxen and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and to the princes that were with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, and brought him up into the high places of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.<br>
