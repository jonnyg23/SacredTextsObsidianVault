 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</a> of the Almighty are within me, the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</a> whereof drinketh up my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Doth the wild <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a> bray when he hath <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>? or loweth the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> over his <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#006">fodder</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a>? or is there any taste in the white of an <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#005">egg</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a>, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Which are blackish by reason of the <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#001">ice</a>, and wherein the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> is hid:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> What time they <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</a> warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The troops of <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#000">Tema</a> looked, the companies of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> waited for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> for your friend.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> is in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?<br>
 </p>
