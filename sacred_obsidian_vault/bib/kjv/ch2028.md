 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For he walked in the ways of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and made also molten images for <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Moreover he burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> whom the LORD had cast out before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He sacrificed also and burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>. And he was also delivered into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, who smote him with a great slaughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd288.htm#002">Pekah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#003">Remaliah</a> slew in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd392.htm#007">Zichri</a>, a mighty man of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, slew <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a> the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</a> that was next to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> of the LORD was there, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#009">Oded</a>: and he went out before the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And now ye purpose to keep under the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then certain of the heads of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#003">Berechiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#000">Meshillemoth</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#004">Jehizkiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#000">Hadlai</a>, stood up against them that came from the war,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> At that time did <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> send unto the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> to help him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For again the Edomites had come and smitten <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and carried away captives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and had taken Bethshemesh, and <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#002">Ajalon</a>, and Gederoth, and <a href="../ebd/ebd340.htm#006">Shocho</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a> thereof, and <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#005">Timnah</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a> thereof, <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#003">Gimzo</a> also and the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a> thereof: and they dwelt there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the LORD brought <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> low because of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; for he made <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>, and transgressed sore against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And Tilgathpilneser <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and of the princes, and gave it unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>: but he helped him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For he sacrificed unto the gods of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> help them, therefore will I <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And in every several city of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> he made high places to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto other gods, and provoked to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> the LORD God of his fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
