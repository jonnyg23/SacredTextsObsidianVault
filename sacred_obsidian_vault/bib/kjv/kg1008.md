 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> assembled the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that they might bring up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD out of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> assembled themselves unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> at the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> in the month <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#003">Ethanim</a>, which is the seventh month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And all the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came, and the priests took up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they brought up the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the LORD, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, and all the holy vessels that were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, sacrificing <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the priests brought in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD unto his place, into the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a> of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, and the cherubims covered the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> and the staves thereof above.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</a>, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> There was nothing in the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> save the two <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> put there at <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</a>, when the LORD made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when they came out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> filled the house of the LORD,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So that the priests could not stand to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then spake <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> turned his face about, and blessed all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: (and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stood;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which spake with his mouth unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Since the day that I brought forth my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, I chose no city out of all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to be over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it was in the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father, and sit on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And I have set there a place for the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a>, wherein is the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> stood before the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD in the presence of all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and spread forth his hands toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he said, LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, there is no God like thee, in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> above, or on earth beneath, who keepest <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Who hast kept with thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Therefore now, LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, keep with thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And now, O God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Yet have thou respect unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> which thy servant shall make toward this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> come before thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> in this house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and do, and <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> When thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and forgive the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is shut up, and there is no <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, when thou afflictest them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Then hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and forgive the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of thy servants, and of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> If there be in the land <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, if there be pestilence, blasting, <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#007">mildew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</a>, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a>, whatsoever sickness there be;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> What <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which shall know every man the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Then hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Moreover concerning a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, that is not of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then hear thou in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> their <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and their supplication, and maintain their cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> If they <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>, and the house which I have built for thy name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> Then hear thou their <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and their supplication in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, that they may have compassion on them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, from the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, O LORD God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> And it was so, that when <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made an end of praying all this <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> And he stood, and blessed all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with a loud voice, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> his servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> at all times, as the matter shall require:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, offered <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> offered a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> dedicated the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> The same day did the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</a> the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of the peace offerings: because the brasen <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> of the peace offerings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> And at that time <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> held a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, a great <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, from the entering in of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a> unto the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, before the LORD our God, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, even fourteen days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> that the LORD had done for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his servant, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his people.<br>
