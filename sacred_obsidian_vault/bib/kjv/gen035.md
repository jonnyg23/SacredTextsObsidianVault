 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 35</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And God said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, Arise, go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and dwell there: and make there an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> thy brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and change your garments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And let us arise, and go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>; and I will make there an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they gave unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a> which were in their ears; and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> hid them under the <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a> which was by <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, that is, <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, he and all the people that were with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he built there an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#008">Deborah</a> Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> under an <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And God appeared unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And God said unto him, Thy name is <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>: thy name shall not be called any more <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, but <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be thy name: and he called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the land which I gave <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> set up a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> in the place where he talked with him, even a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>: and he poured a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> thereon, and he poured oil thereon.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> called the name of the place where God spake with him, <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they journeyed from <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> travailed, and she had hard labour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#009">midwife</a> said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a> died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> set a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> upon her <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>: that is the <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> of Rachel's <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> journeyed, and spread his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> beyond the tower of <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#008">Edar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> dwelt in that land, that <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</a> went and lay with <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#008">Bilhah</a> his father's <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> heard it. Now the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> were twelve:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</a>, Jacob's firstborn, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#002">Issachar</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#008">Bilhah</a>, Rachel's <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#005">Zilpah</a>, Leah's <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a>: these are the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, which were born to him in Padanaram.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his father unto <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>, unto the city of Arbah, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, where <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> sojourned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> were an hundred and fourscore years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> buried him.<br>
