 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#004">Pentecost</a> was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And suddenly there came a sound from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they were all filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and began to speak with other tongues, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> gave them utterance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And there were dwelling at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> Jews, devout men, out of every nation under <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#006">Parthians</a>, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</a>, and in Judaea, and <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#009">Cappadocia</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#003">Pontus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#006">Phrygia</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and in the parts of <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#006">Libya</a> about <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</a>, and strangers of <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>, Jews and proselytes,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Others mocking said, These men are full of new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But this is that which was spoken by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#005">Joel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> upon all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> dreams:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>; and they shall prophesy:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will shew wonders in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> above, and signs in the earth beneath; <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and fire, and vapour of smoke:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shall be turned into <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Ye men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, hear these words; <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall rest in hope:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#009">patriarch</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that he is both dead and buried, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> is with us unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Therefore being a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and knowing that God had sworn with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> to him, that of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of his loins, according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, he would raise up <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to sit on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, that his soul was not left in <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, neither his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> did see corruption.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> This <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Until I make thy foes thy <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Therefore let all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> know assuredly, that God hath made the same <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</a>, and in breaking of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and in prayers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and breaking <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.<br>
