 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Nahum Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a>. The book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#008">Nahum</a> the Elkoshite.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The LORD is slow to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a> languisheth, and <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>, and the flower of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> languisheth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>? his <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But with an overrunning <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> shall pursue his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For now will I break his <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>; for thou art vile.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.<br>
