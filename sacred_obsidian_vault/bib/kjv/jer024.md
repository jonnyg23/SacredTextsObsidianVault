 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, after that <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> Jeconiah the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, with the carpenters and smiths, from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and had brought them to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> One <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</a> had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</a> had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and his princes, and the residue of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a>, a taunt and a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, in all places whither I shall drive them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I will send the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.<br>
