 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church in <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#006">Sardis</a> write; These things saith he that hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> Spirits of God, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thou hast a few names even in <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#006">Sardis</a> which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</a> out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And to the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church in <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#004">Philadelphia</a> write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Behold, I will make them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Behold, I come quickly: hold that <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> which thou hast, that no man take thy <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Him that overcometh will I make a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which cometh down out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> and true <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, the beginning of the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</a> of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I counsel thee to buy of me <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Behold, I stand at the door, and <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#008">knock</a>: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He that hath an <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, let him hear what the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> saith unto the churches.<br>
