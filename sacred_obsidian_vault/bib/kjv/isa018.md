 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</a> on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> in the heat of <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For afore the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, when the bud is perfect, and the sour <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</a> is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>.<br>
