 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 55</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> without money and without price.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Incline your <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with you, even the sure mercies of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Behold, I have given him for a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> to the people, a leader and commander to the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; for he hath glorified thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For as the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> cometh down, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> to the eater:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Instead of the <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</a> shall come up the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> tree, and instead of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#003">brier</a> shall come up the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#004">myrtle</a> tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> sign that shall not be cut off.<br>
