 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, earnestly beholding the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> before God until this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a> commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> perceived that the one part were <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>, and the other <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, he cried out in the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>: and the multitude was divided.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a> say that there is no resurrection, neither <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> confess both.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And there arose a great cry: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> or an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> should have been pulled in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>: for as thou hast testified of me in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, so must thou bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> also at <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, saying that they would neither eat nor <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> till they had killed <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, that we will eat nothing until we have slain <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now therefore ye with the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a> signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> to morrow into the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>, that they will neither eat nor <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And provide them beasts, that they may set <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> on, and bring him safe unto <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a> the governor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he wrote a letter after this manner:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#003">Claudius</a> Lysias unto the most excellent governor <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#001">Felix</a> sendeth greeting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and brought him by night to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#004">Antipatris</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Who, when they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a> and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> also before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.<br>
