 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ruth Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, he, and his wife, and his two sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the name of the man was <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#002">Elimelech</a>, and the name of his wife <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a>, and the name of his two sons <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#001">Mahlon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd080.htm#007">Chilion</a>, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and continued there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#002">Elimelech</a> Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they took them wives of the women of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>; the name of the one was <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#007">Orpah</a>, and the name of the other <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</a>: and they dwelled there about ten years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#001">Mahlon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd080.htm#007">Chilion</a> died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>: for she had heard in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a> said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a> said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#007">Orpah</a> kissed her mother in law; but <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</a> clave unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</a> said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a>: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So they two went until they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>. And it came to pass, when they were come to <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And she said unto them, Call me not <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a>, call me <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#002">Mara</a>: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a>, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</a> returned, and <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</a> the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>: and they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a> in the beginning of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>.<br>
