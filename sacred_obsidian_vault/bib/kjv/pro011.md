 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> A false <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> delivereth from death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> An <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a> with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> concealeth the matter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He that is <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> shall be a sure reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> As <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> They that are of a froward heart are <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> As a jewel of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The liberal soul shall be made <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He that withholdeth <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, the people shall <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> of heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.<br>
