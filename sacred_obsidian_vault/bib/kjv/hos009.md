 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Rejoice not, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> shall fail in her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> shall return to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and they shall eat unclean things in <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They shall not offer <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the LORD?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For, lo, they are gone because of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall gather them up, <a href="../ebd/ebd247.htm#009">Memphis</a> shall bury them: the pleasant places for their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall know it: the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The watchman of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> was with my God: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> is a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> of a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#002">fowler</a> in all his ways, and <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</a> in the house of his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I found <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> like grapes in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> As for <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> away like a <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a>, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>, and from the womb, and from the conception.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> shall bring forth his children to the murderer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> All their wickedness is in <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of their womb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.<br>
