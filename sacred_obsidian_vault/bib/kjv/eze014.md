 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then came certain of the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto me, and sat before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> That I may take the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore say unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For every one of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, or of the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> that sojourneth in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a>, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And if the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they shall bear the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of their iniquity: the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> shall be even as the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> of him that seeketh unto him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> That the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> thereof, and will send <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> upon it, and will cut off man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> from it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Though these three men, <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Or if I bring a <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> upon that land, and say, <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">Sword</a>, go through the land; so that I cut off man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> from it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> upon it in <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, to cut off from it man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Though <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and the noisome <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
