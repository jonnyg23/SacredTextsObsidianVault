 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 78</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I will open my mouth in a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>: I will utter dark sayings of old:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For he established a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and appointed a law in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> That the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>; a <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> that set not their heart aright, and whose <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was not stedfast with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The children of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They kept not the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of God, and refused to walk in his law;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, in the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> In the daytime also he led them with a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and all the night with a light of fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He clave the rocks in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and gave them <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> as out of the great depths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> He brought streams also out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Behold, he smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> also? can he provide <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> for his people?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> also came up against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And had rained down <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> upon them to eat, and had given them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He caused an <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind to blow in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and by his power he brought in the south wind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He rained <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> also upon them as <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he let it fall in the midst of their <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, round about their habitations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> They were not estranged from their <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a>. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And they remembered that God was their <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and the high God their <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> away, and did not stir up all his wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> For he remembered that they were but <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> How oft did they provoke him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and grieve him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> How he had wrought his signs in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and his wonders in the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And had turned their rivers into <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; and their floods, that they could not <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> He destroyed their vines with <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, and their sycomore trees with <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> He gave up their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> also to the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> He cast upon them the fierceness of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> He made a way to his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And smote all the firstborn in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> But made his own people to go forth like <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and guided them in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> like a flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> And he brought them to the border of his <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> He cast out the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to dwell in their tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> For they provoked him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with their high places, and moved him to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> with their graven images.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="059">59</a> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="060">60</a> So that he forsook the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> which he placed among men;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="061">61</a> And delivered his strength into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> into the enemy's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="062">62</a> He gave his people over also unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and was wroth with his inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="063">63</a> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="064">64</a> Their priests fell by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and their <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a> made no <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="065">65</a> Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="066">66</a> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="067">67</a> Moreover he refused the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and chose not the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="068">68</a> But chose the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> which he loved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="069">69</a> And he built his <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="070">70</a> He chose <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="071">71</a> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> his people, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="072">72</a> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.<br>
