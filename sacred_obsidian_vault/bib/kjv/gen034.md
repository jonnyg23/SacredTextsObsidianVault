 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 34</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</a>, which she bare unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, went out to see the daughters of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> the Hivite, <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And his soul clave unto <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> spake unto his father <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a>, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> heard that he had defiled <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</a> his daughter: now his sons were with his <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> in the field: and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> held his peace until they were come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> went out unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> to commune with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> communed with them, saying, The soul of my son <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Ask me never so much <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#009">dowry</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</a> their sister:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And their words pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> Hamor's son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> his son came unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Shall not their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> and their substance and every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> his son hearkened all that went out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of his city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, Dinah's brethren, took each man his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they slew <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> his son with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and took <a href="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</a> out of Shechem's house, and went out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> They took their <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and spoiled even all that was in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>?<br>
