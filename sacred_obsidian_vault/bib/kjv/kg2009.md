 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</a> of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when thou comest thither, look out there <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</a>, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then take the <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</a> of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> So the young man, even the young man the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, went to Ramothgilead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when he came, behold, the captains of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> were <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a>; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, I have anointed thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over the people of the LORD, even over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And thou shalt smite the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> thy master, that I may avenge the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of my servants the prophets, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the whole house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> shall perish: and I will cut off from <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will make the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> like the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, and like the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the dogs shall eat <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> in the portion of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</a> conspired against <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>. (Now <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> had kept Ramothgilead, he and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, because of <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> was returned to be healed in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a> of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>.)  And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> rode in a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>; for <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> lay there. And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> was come down to see <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And there stood a watchman on the tower in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>, and he spied the company of <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> as he came, and said, I see a company. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> said, Take an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#000">horseman</a>, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Is it peace? And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> came to them, but he cometh not again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Is it peace? And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</a>; for he driveth furiously.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> said, Make ready. And his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> was made ready. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went out, each in his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, and they went out against <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a>, and met him in the portion of <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#006">Naboth</a> the Jezreelite.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> saw <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a>, that he said, Is it peace, <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a>? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> and her witchcrafts are so many?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> turned his hands, and fled, and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>, There is treachery, O <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> drew a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> with his full strength, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#006">Naboth</a> the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> his father, the LORD laid this <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> upon him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Surely I have seen yesterday the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#006">Naboth</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>. And they did so at the going up to <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#001">Gur</a>, which is by <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#009">Ibleam</a>. And he fled to <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#004">Megiddo</a>, and died there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And his servants carried him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and buried him in his <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And in the eleventh year of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> began <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> to reign over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And as <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> entered in at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, she said, Had <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#009">Zimri</a> peace, who slew his master?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And when he was come in, he did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</a>, saying, In the portion of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a> shall dogs eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a> shall be as <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a> upon the face of the field in the portion of <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>; so that they shall not say, This is <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</a>.<br>
