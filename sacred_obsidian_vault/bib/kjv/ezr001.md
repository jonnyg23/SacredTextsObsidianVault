 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezra Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now in the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>, The LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and build the house of the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, (he is the God,) which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for the house of God that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then rose up the chief of the fathers of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> had brought forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and had put them in the house of his gods;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Even those did <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a> bring forth by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd257.htm#005">Mithredath</a> the treasurer, and numbered them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#003">Sheshbazzar</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, a thousand chargers of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, nine and twenty knives,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thirty basons of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> All the vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> were five thousand and four hundred. All these did <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#003">Sheshbazzar</a> bring up with them of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> that were brought up from <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
