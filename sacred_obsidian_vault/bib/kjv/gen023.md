 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 23</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> was an hundred and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> died in Kirjatharba; the same is <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a>, and to weep for her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, saying unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#006">Zohar</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> That he may give me the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#007">Machpelah</a>, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> dwelt among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the Hittite answered <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> in the audience of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>, even of all that went in at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of his city, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> bowed down himself before the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, saying unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> hearkened unto <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> weighed to <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, which he had named in the audience of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>, four hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, current money with the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#003">merchant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#008">Ephron</a> which was in <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#007">Machpelah</a>, which was before <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>, the field, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> for a possession in the presence of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>, before all that went in at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of his city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And after this, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> buried <a href="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</a> his wife in the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> of the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#007">Machpelah</a> before <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>: the same is <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the field, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> that is therein, were made sure unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</a>.<br>
