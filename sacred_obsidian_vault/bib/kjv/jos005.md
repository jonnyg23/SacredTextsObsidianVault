 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, which were on the side of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</a>, and all the kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> from before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in them any more, because of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> At that time the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> the second time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> at the hill of the foreskins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And this is the cause why <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> did circumcise: All the people that came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> by the way, after they came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> by the way as they came forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, them they had not circumcised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> walked forty years in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, till they were whole.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, This day have I rolled away the reproach of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> encamped in <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, and kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they did eat of the old <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> of the land on the morrow after the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, unleavened cakes, and parched <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> in the selfsame day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> of the land; neither had the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a> any more; but they did eat of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a> that year.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> was by <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> drawn in his hand: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said, Nay; but as captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the LORD am I now come. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> fell on his face to the earth, and did <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the captain of the LORD's <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Loose thy <a href="../ebd/ebd340.htm#009">shoe</a> from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> did so.<br>
