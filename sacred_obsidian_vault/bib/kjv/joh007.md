 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> After these things <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> walked in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Now the Jew's <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of tabernacles was at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For neither did his brethren believe in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Go ye up unto this <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>: I go not up yet unto this <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>: for my time is not yet full come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, not openly, but as it were in secret.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then the Jews sought him at the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, and said, Where is he?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And there was much <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#003">murmuring</a> among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now about the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went up into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and taught.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: but he that seeketh his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Did not <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?  Why go ye about to kill me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The people answered and said, Thou hast a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>: who goeth about to kill thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> therefore gave unto you <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>; (not because it is of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, but of the fathers;) and ye on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day circumcise a man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> If a man on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day receive <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>, that the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> not according to the appearance, but <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> righteous judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then said some of them of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then cried <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and the chief priests sent officers to take him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and teach the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> In the last day, that great day of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> He that believeth on me, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> hath said, out of his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> shall flow rivers of living water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> (But this spake he of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> was not yet given; because that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was not yet glorified.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">Prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Others said, This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>. But some said, Shall <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> come out of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Hath not the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> said, That <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> cometh of the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and out of the town of <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</a>, where <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> So there was a division among the people because of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then came the officers to the chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Then answered them the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, Are ye also deceived?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Have any of the rulers or of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> believed on him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</a> saith unto them, (he that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> by night, being one of them,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Doth our law <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>?  Search, and look: for out of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> ariseth no <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> And every man went unto his own house.<br>
