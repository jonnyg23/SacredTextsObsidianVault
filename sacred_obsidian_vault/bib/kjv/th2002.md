 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and by our gathering together unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of God, shewing himself that he is God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Even him, whose coming is after the working of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> with all power and signs and lying wonders,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> you to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> through <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#004">sanctification</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> and belief of the truth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Whereunto he called you by our <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, to the obtaining of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore, brethren, stand <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> consolation and good hope through <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.<br>
