 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> by the will of God, to the saints which are at <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> According as he hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Having predestinated us unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</a> of children by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> To the praise of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In whom we have <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> through his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Having made known unto us the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> That in the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#006">dispensation</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of times he might gather together in one all things in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, both which are in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and which are on earth; even in him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That we should be to the praise of his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, who first trusted in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of your <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of promise,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Which is the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</a> of our inheritance until the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and love unto all the saints,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That the God of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Father of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, may give unto you the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of wisdom and <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</a> in the knowledge of him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a>, and what the riches of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his inheritance in the saints,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Which he wrought in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Which is his body, the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of him that filleth all in all.<br>
