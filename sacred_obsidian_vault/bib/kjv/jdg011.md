 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, and went out with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> made war against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it was so, that when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> made war against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> went to fetch <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> out of the land of Tob:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> said unto the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and be our head over all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> said unto the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, The LORD be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> between us, if we do not so according to thy words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> went with the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, and the people made him head and captain over them: and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> sent messengers unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> answered unto the messengers of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, Because <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> took away my land, when they came up out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#006">Jabbok</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> sent messengers again unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And said unto him, Thus saith <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> took not away the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, nor the land of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came up from <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and walked through the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> unto the Red sea, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#003">Kadesh</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> sent messengers unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>: but he would not consent: and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> abode in <a href="../ebd/ebd215.htm#003">Kadesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then they went along through the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and compassed the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and came by the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> side of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and pitched on the other side of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a>, but came not within the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>: for <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a> was the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> sent messengers unto <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> trusted not <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to pass through his coast: but <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> gathered all his people together, and pitched in <a href="../ebd/ebd195.htm#005">Jahaz</a>, and fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> and all his people into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and they smote them: so <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> possessed all the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, the inhabitants of that country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they possessed all the coasts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd193.htm#006">Jabbok</a>, and from the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So now the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> hath dispossessed the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> from before his people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and shouldest thou possess it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Wilt not thou possess that which <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a> thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And now art thou any thing better than <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>? did he ever strive against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, or did he ever fight against them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> While <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a> and her towns, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#001">Aroer</a> and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</a>, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</a> be <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> this day between the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Howbeit the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> hearkened not unto the words of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> which he sent him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD came upon <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a>, and he passed over <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, and passed over Mizpeh of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, and from Mizpeh of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a> he passed over unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> into mine hands,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> passed over unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he smote them from <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#001">Aroer</a>, even till thou come to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#009">Minnith</a>, even twenty cities, and unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> were subdued before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> That the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went yearly to lament the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</a> the Gileadite four days in a year.<br>
