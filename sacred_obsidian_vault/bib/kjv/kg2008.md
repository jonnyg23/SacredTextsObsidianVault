 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then spake <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>; and it shall also come upon the land <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And it came to pass at the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: and she went forth to cry unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> for her house and for her land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> talked with <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</a> the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> hath done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it came to pass, as he was telling the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> for her house and for her land. And <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</a> said, My lord, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> restored to life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> asked the woman, she told him. So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>; and Benhadad the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a>, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, forty camels' <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So he departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, and came to his master; who said to him, What said <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And in the fifth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> being then <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> the son of Je hoshaphat <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> began to reign.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he walked in the way of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as did the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>: for the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Yet the LORD would not destroy <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> In his days <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> revolted from under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and made a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> went over to <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#009">Zair</a>, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Yet <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a> revolted from under the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> unto this day. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a> revolted at the same time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> In the twelfth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> did <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> begin to reign.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Two and twenty years old was <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he walked in the way of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>: for he was the son in law of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he went with <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> to the war against <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> went back to be healed in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a> of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, when he fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went down to see <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>, because he was sick.<br>
