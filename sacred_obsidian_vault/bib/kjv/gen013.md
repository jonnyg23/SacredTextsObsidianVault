 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> went up out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> was very rich in <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he went on his journeys from the south even to <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, unto the place where his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> had been at the beginning, between <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> and Hai;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Unto the place of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, which he had make there at the first: and there <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> called on the name of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And Lot also, which went with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>, had flocks, and herds, and tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> and the herdmen of Lot's <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</a> and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a>, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, as thou comest unto <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#004">Zoar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then Lot chose him all the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>; and Lot journeyed <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>: and they separated themselves the one from the other.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> dwelled in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>, and pitched his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> toward <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a>, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</a>, and southward, and eastward, and <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And I will make thy seed as the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth: so that if a man can number the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</a> removed his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and came and dwelt in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</a>, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, and built there an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> unto the LORD.<br>
