 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the third day there was a marriage in <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>; and the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was there:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And both <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when they wanted <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, They have no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And there were set there six waterpots of <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>. And they bare it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When the ruler of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> had tasted the water that was made <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> called the bridegroom,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>; and when men have well <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a>, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> until now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> This beginning of miracles did <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and manifested forth his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>; and his disciples believed on him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> After this he went down to <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the Jews' <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> was at hand, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And found in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> those that sold oxen and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> and doves, and the changers of money <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> of thine house hath eaten me up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto them, Destroy this <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and in three days I will raise it up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But he spake of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of his body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a>, and the word which <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now when he was in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> at the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.<br>
