 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> loved many strange women, together with the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> clave unto these in love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he had <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> went after <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#006">Ashtoreth</a> the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of the Ammonites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then did <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> build an high place for <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, in the hill that is before <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and for Molech, the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> and sacrificed unto their gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD was angry with <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which had appeared unto him twice,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Wherefore the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> to thy son for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the LORD stirred up an <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> (For six months did <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> remain there with all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, until he had cut off every male in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> being yet a little child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they arose out of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#006">Paran</a>: and they took men with them out of <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#006">Paran</a>, and they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> found great favour in the sight of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#006">Tahpenes</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the sister of <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#006">Tahpenes</a> bare him <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#002">Genubath</a> his son, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#006">Tahpenes</a> weaned in Pharaoh's house: and <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#002">Genubath</a> was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> heard in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> slept with his fathers, and that <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> was dead, <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And God stirred him up another <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#007">Rezon</a> the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#001">Hadadezer</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#005">Zobah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> slew them of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#005">Zobah</a>: and they went to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, and dwelt therein, and reigned in <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he was an <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> all the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, beside the mischief that <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#000">Hadad</a> did: and he abhorred <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and reigned over <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#007">Ephrathite</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#003">Zereda</a>, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#007">Zeruah</a>, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> built <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#004">Millo</a>, and repaired the breaches of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the man <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> was a mighty man of valour: and <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And it came to pass at that time when <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> went out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#009">Shilonite</a> found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> caught the new garment that was on him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> it in twelve <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, Take thee ten <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>: for thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and will give ten tribes to thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> (But he shall have one <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> out of all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#006">Ashtoreth</a> the goddess of the Zidonians, <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#007">Chemosh</a> the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> all the days of his life for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And unto his son will I give one <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant may have a light alway before me in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the city which I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> me to put my name there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and will give <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And I will for this afflict the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, but not for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> sought therefore to kill <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> arose, and fled into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, unto Shishak <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and was in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> until the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And the time that <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> reigned in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> over all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father: and <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
