 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At that time <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day through the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> and to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But when the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But he said unto them, Have ye not read what <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days the priests in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> profane the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, and are blameless?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, and not <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For the Son of man is Lord even of the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when he was departed thence, he went into their <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days? that they might accuse him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and if it fall into a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a> on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> How much then is a man better than a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> went out, and held a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a> against him, how they might destroy him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And charged them that they should not make him known:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold my servant, whom I have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> A bruised <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a> shall he not break, and smoking <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a> shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And in his name shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> trust.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a>: and he healed him, insomuch that the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> both spake and saw.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But when the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And if <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> cast out <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And if I by <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</a> cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But if I cast out devils by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a> against the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> shall not be forgiven unto men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Either make the tree good, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> corrupt: for the tree is known by his <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Then certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> For as <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a> was three days and three nights in the whale's <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> The men of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> shall rise in judgment with this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a>; and, behold, a greater than <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a> is here.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>; and, behold, a greater than <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> is here.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> When the unclean <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?  and who are my brethren?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.<br>
