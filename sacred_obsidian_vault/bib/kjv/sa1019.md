 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> spake to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> Saul's son delighted much in <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> spake good of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> his father, and said unto him, Let not the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against his servant, against <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> for all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> against innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, to slay <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> without a cause?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> hearkened unto the voice of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> shewed him all those things. And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> brought <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and he was in his presence, as in times past.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there was war again: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went out, and fought with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> from the LORD was upon <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, as he sat in his house with his <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</a> in his hand: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> played with his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sought to smite <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> even to the wall with the <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</a>: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</a> into the wall: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> fled, and escaped that night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> let <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</a>, and covered it with a cloth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent messengers to take <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, she said, He is sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent the messengers again to see <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a>, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> fled, and escaped, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, and told him all that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> had done to him. And he and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> went and dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, saying, Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> is at <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent messengers to take <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> standing as appointed over them, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God was upon the messengers of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and they also prophesied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then went he also to <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, and came to a great well that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#007">Sechu</a>: and he asked and said, Where are <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>? And one said, Behold, they be at <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he went thither to <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> in like manner, and lay down <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a> all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> also among the prophets?<br>
