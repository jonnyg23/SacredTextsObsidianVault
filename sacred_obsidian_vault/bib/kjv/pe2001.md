 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Peter Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, a servant and an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God and our <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> our Lord,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</a>, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and virtue:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And to <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#007">godliness</a> brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But he that lacketh these things is <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</a>, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> kingdom of our Lord and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Knowing that shortly I must put off this my <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, even as our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> hath shewed me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For he received from God the Father honour and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And this voice which came from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> we heard, when we were with him in the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> We have also a more sure word of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a>; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Knowing this first, that no <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> is of any private interpretation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
