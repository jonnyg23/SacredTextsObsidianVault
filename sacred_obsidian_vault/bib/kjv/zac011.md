 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Open thy <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, that the fire may devour thy cedars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Howl, <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> tree; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> of the vintage is come down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>; for the pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> is spoiled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">Bands</a>; and I fed the flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which I had made with all the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it was broken in that day: and so the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">Bands</a>, that I might break the brotherhood between <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For, lo, I will raise up a <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>, and tear their claws in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Woe to the <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> that leaveth the flock! the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.<br>
