 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of Judaea,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is at hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For this is he that was spoken of by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a>, saying, The voice of one crying in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then went out to him <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and all Judaea, and all the region round about <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And were baptized of him in <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, confessing their sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But when he saw many of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a> come to his baptism, he said unto them, O <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And think not to say within yourselves, We have <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And now also the <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</a> is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I indeed baptize you with water unto <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and with fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Whose <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a> is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#005">garner</a>; but he will burn up the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> with unquenchable fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then cometh <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> unto John, to be baptized of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>. Then he suffered him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God descending like a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a>, and lighting upon him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And lo a voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br>
