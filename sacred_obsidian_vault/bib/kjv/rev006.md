 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I saw when the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a>, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>; and a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when he had opened the second <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, I heard the second <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> say, Come and see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when he had opened the third <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, I heard the third <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</a>, and three measures of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</a>; and see thou hurt not the oil and the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when he had opened the fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, I heard the voice of the fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> say, Come and see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">Hell</a> followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when he had opened the fifth <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, I saw under the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> which they held:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> and avenge our <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> on them that dwell on the earth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I beheld when he had opened the sixth <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, and, lo, there was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> became black as <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a> of hair, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> became as <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> fell unto the earth, even as a <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</a> were moved out of their places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and from the wrath of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?<br>
