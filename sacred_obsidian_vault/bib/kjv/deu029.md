 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 29</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> These are the words of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, which the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> to make with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, beside the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> which he made with them in <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> called unto all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I have led you forty years in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd340.htm#009">shoe</a> is not waxen old upon thy foot.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ye have not eaten <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, neither have ye <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> or strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when ye came unto this place, <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#002">Og</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Keep therefore the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Your little ones, your wives, and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> that is in thy <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, from the hewer of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> unto the drawer of thy water:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That thou shouldest enter into <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the LORD thy God, and into his <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Neither with you only do I make this <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> and this <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, which were among them:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, that he <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The LORD will not spare him, but then the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD and his <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</a> out his name from under <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, according to all the curses of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that are written in this book of the law:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So that the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And that the whole land thereof is <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a>, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> groweth therein, like the overthrow of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#003">Admah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#009">Zeboim</a>, which the LORD overthrew in his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and in his wrath:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the LORD rooted them out of their land in <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.<br>
