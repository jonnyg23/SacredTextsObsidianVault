 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> unto God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For when we were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> unto death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and not in the oldness of the letter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> What shall we say then? Is the law <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>? God forbid. Nay, I had not known <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, but by the law: for I had not known <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a>, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#008">concupiscence</a>. For without the law <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> was dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> revived, and I died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, that it might appear <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, working death in me by that which is good; that <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</a>, sold under <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now then it is no more I that do it, but <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> that dwelleth in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For I know that in me (that is, in my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> that dwelleth in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> to the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> which is in my members.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> I thank God through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
