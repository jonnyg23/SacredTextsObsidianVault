 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 46</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#005">Bel</a> boweth down, <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#004">Nebo</a> stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> to the weary <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> They stoop, they <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down together; they could not deliver the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>, but themselves are gone into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Hearken unto me, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and all the remnant of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which are borne by me from the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, which are carried from the womb:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They lavish <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</a>, and weigh <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a>, and hire a <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#003">goldsmith</a>; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">Calling</a> a ravenous <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a> from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I bring near my <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; it shall not be far off, and my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> shall not tarry: and I will place <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> my <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
