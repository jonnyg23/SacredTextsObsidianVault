 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> feedeth on wind, and followeth after the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The LORD hath also a controversy with <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and will punish <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yea, he had power over the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and there he spake with us;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> and judgment and wait on thy God continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He is a <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#003">merchant</a>, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Is there iniquity in <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>? surely they are vanity: they <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> bullocks in <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> fled into the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> served for a wife, and for a wife he kept <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And by a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> the LORD brought <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and by a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> was he preserved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> provoked him to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him.<br>
