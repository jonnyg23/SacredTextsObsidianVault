 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 37</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</a> reigned instead of Coniah the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a>, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#008">Jehucal</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#008">Zephaniah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and when the Chaldeans that besieged <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> heard tidings of them, they departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then came the word of the LORD unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Thus shall ye say to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> into their own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and burn this city with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for fear of Pharaoh's army,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> went forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to go into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when he was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, a captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</a> was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</a>; and he took <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, and brought him to the princes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Wherefore the princes were wroth with <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, and smote him, and put him in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the scribe: for they had made that the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> was entered into the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</a>, and into the <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#000">cabins</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> had remained there many days;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent, and took him out: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> shall not come against you, nor against this land?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the scribe, lest I die there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded that they should commit <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> into the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, and that they should give him daily a piece of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> out of the bakers' street, until all the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in the city were spent. Thus <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> remained in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
