 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, See now, I dwell in an house of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of God dwelleth within curtains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Go and tell my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, even to this day, but have walked in a <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> and in a <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> spake I a word with any of the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whom I commanded to feed my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, Why build ye not me an house of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, to be ruler over my people, over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Moreover I will appoint a place for my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a>, and I will establish his kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of his kingdom for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</a> of the children of men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But my <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> shall not depart away from him, as I took it from <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, whom I put away before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> shall be established for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> According to all these words, and according to all this <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, so did <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> speak unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then went <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And what can <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, from the nations and their gods?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and let the house of thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> be established before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> unto thy servant:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Therefore now let it please thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.<br>
