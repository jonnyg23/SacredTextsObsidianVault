 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and give ye <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, O house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> on <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</a> spread upon <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#007">Tabor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I know <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is not hid from me: for now, O <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, thou committest whoredom, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is defiled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> doth testify to his face: therefore shall <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> fall in their iniquity: <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> also shall fall with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Blow ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#009">cornet</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a>, and the trumpet in <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have I made known that which shall surely be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore will I be unto <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> as a <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a>, and to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> as rottenness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> saw his sickness, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> saw his wound, then went <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> to the Assyrian, and sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For I will be unto <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.<br>
