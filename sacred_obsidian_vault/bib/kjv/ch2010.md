 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> went to <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>: for to <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> were all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> come to make him <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>, who was in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, whither he fled from the presence of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, heard it, that <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> returned out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they sent and called him. So <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came and spake to <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Thy father made our <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> took counsel with the old men that had stood before <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> that thy father did put upon us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For whereas my father put a heavy <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> upon you, I will put more to your <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a>: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> and all the people came to <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> on the third day, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered them roughly; and <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> forsook the counsel of the old men,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#009">Shilonite</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> would not hearken unto them, the people answered the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, saying, What portion have we in <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>?  and we have none inheritance in the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</a>: every man to your tents, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and now, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, see to thine own house. So all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went to their tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But as for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that dwelt in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> reigned over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> sent <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#001">Hadoram</a> that was over the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>; and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> stoned him with stones, that he died. But <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> made speed to get him up to his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>, to flee to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> rebelled against the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> unto this day.<br>
