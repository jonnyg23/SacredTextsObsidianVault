 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> heard of the fame of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, she came to prove <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> with hard questions at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, with a very great company, and camels that bare <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> which he told her not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> had seen the wisdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, and the house that he had built,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the meat of his table, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>; his cupbearers also, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And she said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, to be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over them, to do judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And she gave the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> an hundred and twenty talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a> great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> gave <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, which brought <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a>, brought <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#002">algum</a> trees and precious stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made of the <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#002">algum</a> trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> gave to the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now the weight of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#009">Arabia</a> and governors of the country brought <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made two hundred targets of beaten <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: six hundred shekels of beaten <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> went to one <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#001">target</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And three hundred shields made he of beaten <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: three hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> went to one <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> put them in the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made a great <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a>, and overlaid it with pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And there were six steps to the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, with a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, which were fastened to the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and stays on each side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> place, and two <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> standing by the stays:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And twelve <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And all the drinking vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> were of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and all the vessels of the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> were of pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: none were of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> went to <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</a> with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</a> bringing <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a>, and apes, and peacocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they brought every man his present, vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and raiment, <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#007">harness</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> cities, and with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and to the border of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> as stones, and <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they brought unto <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> horses out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and out of all lands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, first and last, are they not written in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#009">Shilonite</a>, and in the visions of <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#005">Iddo</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> reigned in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> over all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> forty years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his father: and <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
