 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 30</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus speaketh the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> from off thy <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, whom I will raise up unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, whom no man seeketh after.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of Jacob's tents, and have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> shall remain after the manner thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> them, and they shall not be small.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.<br>
