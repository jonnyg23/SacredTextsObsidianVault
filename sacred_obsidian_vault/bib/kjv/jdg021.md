 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said, O LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, why is this come to pass in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that there should be to day one <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> lacking in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> said, Who is there among all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that came not up with the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> unto the LORD? For they had made a great <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> repented them for <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> their brother, and said, There is one <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> cut off from <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, with the women and the children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> sent some to speak to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> that were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</a>, and to call peaceably unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the people repented them for <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, because that the LORD had made a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> in the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then the elders of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, that a <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> be not destroyed out of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then they said, Behold, there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of the LORD in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> yearly in a place which is on the north side of <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, on the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a> that goeth up from <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>, and on the south of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#003">Lebonah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore they commanded the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a> come out to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</a> in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, and go to the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> departed thence at that time, every man to his <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> In those days there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.<br>
