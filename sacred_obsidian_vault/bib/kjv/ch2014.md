 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#006">Abijah</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Also he took away out of all the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he built fenced cities in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore he said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a>, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> three hundred thousand; and out of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And there came out against them <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</a> the Ethiopian with an <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#009">Mareshah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#000">Zephathah</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#009">Mareshah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, and before <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and the Ethiopians fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> and the people that were with him pursued them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>; and they carried away very much spoil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they smote all the cities round about <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They smote also the tents of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> and camels in abundance, and returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
