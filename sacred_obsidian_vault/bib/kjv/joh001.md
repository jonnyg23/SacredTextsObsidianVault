 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The same was in the beginning with God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> In him was life; and the life was the light of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the light shineth in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> comprehended it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The same came for a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, to bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of the Light, that all men through him might believe.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He was not that Light, but was sent to bear <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of that Light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Which were born, not of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, nor of the will of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, nor of the will of man, but of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the Word was made <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> and truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> John bare <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And of his <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> have all we received, and <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the law was given by <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, but <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> and truth came by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a> of the Father, he hath declared him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to ask him, Who art thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they asked him, What then? Art thou <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>? And he answered, No.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they which were sent were of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>, neither that <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's <a href="../ebd/ebd224.htm#006">latchet</a> I am not worthy to unloose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> These things were done in <a href="../ebd/ebd054.htm#004">Bethabara</a> beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, where John was baptizing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> The next day John seeth <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> coming unto him, and saith, Behold the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> of God, which taketh away the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, therefore am I come baptizing with water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And John bare record, saying, I saw the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> descending from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> like a <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</a>, and it abode upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And looking upon <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> as he walked, he saith, Behold the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a> of God!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</a>, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> Peter's brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> He first findeth his own brother <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And he brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>. And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> beheld him, he said, Thou art <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> the son of Jona: thou shalt be called <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</a>, which is by interpretation, A <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> The day following <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> would go forth into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and findeth <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, and saith unto him, Follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Now <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> was of <a href="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</a>, the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> findeth <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</a>, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> in the law, and the prophets, did write, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</a> said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>? <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> saith unto him, Come and see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saw <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</a> coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</a> saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto him, Before that <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> called thee, when thou wast under the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree, I saw thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</a> answered and saith unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</a>, thou art the Son of God; thou art the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.<br>
