 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Go in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> came in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> is destroyed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> were brought again unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Stretch out thine hand over the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and eat every <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> of the land, even all that the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> hath left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> stretched forth his rod over the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and the LORD brought an <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind brought the locusts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</a> went up over all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and rested in all the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> of the land, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the trees which the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> called for <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he went out from <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and intreated the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</a> in all the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Stretch out thine hand toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, that there may be <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> over the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, even <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> which may be felt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> stretched forth his hand toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and there was a thick <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> three days:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had light in their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> called unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto the LORD our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Our <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> also shall go with us; there shall not an <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#003">hoof</a> be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.<br>
