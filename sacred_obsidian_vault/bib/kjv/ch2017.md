 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he placed <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a> in all the fenced cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and set garrisons in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, which <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> his father had taken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the LORD was with <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, because he walked in the first ways of his father <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and sought not unto <a href="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> brought to <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#003">Nethaneel</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#000">Michaiah</a>, to teach in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And with them he sent Levites, even <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#005">Zebadiah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#009">Shemiramoth</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#004">Jehonathan</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#002">Tobijah</a>, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a>, priests.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they taught in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and taught the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, so that they made no war against <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Also some of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> brought <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> presents, and <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; and the Arabians brought him flocks, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred rams, and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred he goats.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a> waxed great exceedingly; and he built in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> castles, and cities of store.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he had much business in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, the captains of <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#004">Adnah</a> the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And next to him was <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#008">Jehohanan</a> the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And next him was <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#006">Amasiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd392.htm#007">Zichri</a>, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>; <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#009">Eliada</a> a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> two hundred thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And next him was <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#005">Jehozabad</a>, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> These waited on the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, beside those whom the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> put in the fenced cities throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
