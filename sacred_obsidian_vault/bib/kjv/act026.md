 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Agrippa said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I think myself happy, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, know all the Jews;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</a> of our religion I lived a Pharisee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Which thing I also did in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and many of the saints did I shut up in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I punished them oft in every <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Whereupon as I went to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> with authority and commission from the chief priests,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> At midday, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, I saw in the way a light from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, above the brightness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> tongue, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> whom thou persecutest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> and a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Delivering thee from the people, and from the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, unto whom now I send thee,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> To open their eyes, and to turn them from <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> to light, and from the power of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Whereupon, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But shewed first unto them of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, and at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For these causes the Jews caught me in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and went about to kill me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> did say should come:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> That <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then Agrippa said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when he had thus spoken, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> rose up, and the governor, and <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#006">Bernice</a>, and they that sat with them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>.<br>
