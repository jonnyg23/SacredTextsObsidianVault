 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the end of the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a> and the other <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> to see the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And, behold, there was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord descended from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and came and rolled back the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> from the door, and sat upon it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> His countenance was like <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</a>, and his raiment white as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, which was crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they departed quickly from the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> met them, saying, All <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, and there shall they see me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then the eleven disciples went away into <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, into a mountain where <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> had appointed them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and in earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
