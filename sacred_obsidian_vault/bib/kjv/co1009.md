 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Am I not an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a>? am I not free? have I not seen <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> If I be not an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Have we not power to eat and to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Or I only and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, have not we power to forbear working?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> of the flock?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For it is written in the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Thou shalt not <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#001">muzzle</a> the mouth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> that treadeth out the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>. Doth God take care for oxen?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</a> things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Do ye not know that they which <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> about holy things live of the things of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>? and they which wait at the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> are partakers with the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> should live of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For though I preach the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, I have nothing to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#006">dispensation</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> is committed unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>, I may make the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> without charge, that I abuse not my power in the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And unto the Jews I became as a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>,) that I might gain them that are without law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a>; but we an incorruptible.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#007">castaway</a>.<br>
