 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now I say, That the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a>, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Even so we, when we were children, were in <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> under the <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#004">elements</a> of the world:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But when the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</a> of sons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of his Son into your hearts, crying, <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#007">Abba</a>, Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> of God through <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#004">elements</a>, whereunto ye desire again to be in <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Ye know how through infirmity of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> I preached the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> unto you at the first.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And my <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a> which was in my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God, even as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> My little children, of whom I travail in <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a> again until <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be formed in you,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For it is written, that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>; but he of the freewoman was by promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Which things are an <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#004">allegory</a>: for these are the two covenants; the one from the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, which gendereth to <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>, which is Agar.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For this Agar is <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#009">Arabia</a>, and answereth to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> which now is, and is in <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> with her children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For it is written, Rejoice, thou <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Now we, brethren, as <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was, are the children of promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But as then he that was born after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> persecuted him that was born after the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>, even so it is now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Nevertheless what saith the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a>? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</a> with the son of the freewoman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.<br>
