 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</a>: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</a> of a book was therein;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.<br>
