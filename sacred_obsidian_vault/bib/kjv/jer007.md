 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Stand in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that enter in at these gates to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, The <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, The <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, are these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> If ye oppress not the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a>, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Will ye steal, <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</a>, and commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>, and swear falsely, and burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Is this house, which is called by my name, become a <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But go ye now unto my place which was in <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Seest thou not what they do in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The children gather <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#005">knead</a> their <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#006">dough</a>, to make cakes to the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and to pour out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Do they provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, but hardened their <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>: they did worse than their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Cut off thine hair, O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and cast it away, and take up a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a> on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> of his wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they have built the high places of <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, which is in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, nor the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of slaughter: for they shall bury in <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a>, till there be no place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Then will I cause to cease from the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and from the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a>: for the land shall be desolate.<br>
