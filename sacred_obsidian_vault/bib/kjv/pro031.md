 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The words of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#000">Lemuel</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> that his mother taught him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> It is not for kings, O <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#000">Lemuel</a>, it is not for kings to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>; nor for princes strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Lest they <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Give strong <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> unto him that is ready to perish, and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> unto those that be of heavy hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Let him <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Open thy mouth for the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> in the cause of all such as are appointed to <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Open thy mouth, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> righteously, and plead the cause of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> and needy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> She seeketh <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a>, and worketh willingly with her hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> She is like the merchants' <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>; she bringeth her food from afar.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of her hands she planteth a vineyard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a> goeth not out by night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#008">distaff</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> She stretcheth out her hand to the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> She is not afraid of the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a> for her household: for all her household are clothed with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#005">silk</a> and purple.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> She maketh fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#003">merchant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of idleness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Give her of the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.<br>
 </p>
