 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Amos Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear this word, ye <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>, that are in the mountain of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, which oppress the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The Lord GOD hath sworn by his <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#001">cow</a> at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Come to <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and transgress; at <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a> multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And offer a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of thanksgiving with <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a>, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And also I have withholden the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> from you, when there were yet three months to the <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>: and I caused it to <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon one city, and caused it not to <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I have smitten you with blasting and <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#007">mildew</a>: when your <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a> and your vineyards and your <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> trees and your <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a> trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: your young men have I slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</a>, and ye were as a <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#007">firebrand</a> plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.<br>
