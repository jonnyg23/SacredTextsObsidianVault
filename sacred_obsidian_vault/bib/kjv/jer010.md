 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and be not dismayed at the signs of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> are dismayed at them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, the work of the hands of the workman, with the <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They deck it with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Who would not fear thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">Silver</a> spread into plates is brought from <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#000">Uphaz</a>, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</a> and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The portion of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#005">sling</a> out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> any more, and to set up my curtains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Behold, the noise of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#008">bruit</a> is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> desolate, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of dragons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, lest thou bring me to nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Pour out thy <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> desolate.<br>
