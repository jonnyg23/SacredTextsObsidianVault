 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 107</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And gathered them out of the lands, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They wandered in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Such as sit in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, being bound in affliction and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He brought them out of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, and brake their <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> in sunder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For he hath broken the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and cut the bars of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> in sunder.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And let them <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> They that go down to the sea in <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>, that do business in great waters;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> They <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> up to the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Let them exalt him also in the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> He turneth rivers into a <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, and the watersprings into dry ground;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> He turneth the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> to decrease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, where there is no way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Yet setteth he the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Whoso is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.<br>
