 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And that he was seen of <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</a>, then of the twelve:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> After that, he was seen of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>; then of all the apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a>, because I persecuted the church of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But by the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God I am what I am: and his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God which was with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now if <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> not risen:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And if <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For if the dead rise not, then is not <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> raised:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And if <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then they also which are fallen asleep in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> are perished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> If in this life only we have hope in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, we are of all men most miserable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But now is <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For as in <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> all die, even so in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> shall all be made alive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But every man in his own order: <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> our LORD, I die daily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; for to morrow we die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Awake to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</a>, it may chance of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, or of some other <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> All <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is not the same <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: but there is one kind of <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of men, another <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the celestial is one, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the terrestrial is another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> There is one <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and another <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, and another <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>: for one star differeth from another star in <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And so it is written, The first man <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> was made a living soul; the last <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a> was made a quickening <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="049">49</a> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="050">50</a> Now this I say, brethren, that <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="051">51</a> Behold, I shew you a <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a>; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="052">52</a> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="053">53</a> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#009">immortality</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="054">54</a> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#009">immortality</a>, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="055">55</a> O death, where is thy sting? O <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, where is thy victory?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="056">56</a> The sting of death is <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; and the strength of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> is the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="057">57</a> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="058">58</a> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<br>
