 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 52</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#009">Hamutal</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For through the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD it came to pass in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, till he had cast them out from his presence, that <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> rebelled against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> came, he and all his army, against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> was sore in the city, so that there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> for the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and overtook <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>; and all his army was scattered from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then they took the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and carried him up unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>; where he gave judgment upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> slew the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then he put out the eyes of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> bound him in chains, and carried him to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and put him in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> till the day of his death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, came <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a>, captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, which served the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, into <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, brake down all the walls of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and the rest of the multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> left certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Also the pillars of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> of them to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> wherewith they ministered, took they away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and that which was of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, took the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made in the house of the LORD: the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> of all these vessels was without weight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And concerning the pillars, the height of one <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#004">chapiter</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a> was upon it; and the height of one <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#004">chapiter</a> was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>. The second <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> also and the pomegranates were like unto these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</a> the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#008">Zephaniah</a> the second <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and the three keepers of the door:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He took also out of the city an <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a>, which had the charge of the men of war; and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> took them, and brought them to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> smote them, and put them to death in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#002">Riblah</a> in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</a>. Thus <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> was carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> out of his own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> This is the people whom <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> In the eighteenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> he carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> eight hundred thirty and two persons:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> In the three and twentieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> of the Jews <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And it came to pass in the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> and thirtieth year of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and brought him forth out of <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And spake kindly unto him, and set his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> above the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of the kings that were with him in <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And changed his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> garments: and he did continually eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> before him all the days of his life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.<br>
