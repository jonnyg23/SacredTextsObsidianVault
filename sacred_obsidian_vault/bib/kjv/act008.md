 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</a> against the church which was at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, except the apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And devout men carried <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a> to his <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</a>, and made great <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</a> over him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> As for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> went down to the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, and preached <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there was great joy in that city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But there was a certain man, called <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, giving out that himself was some great one:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But when they believed <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, they were baptized, both men and women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now when the apostles which were at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> heard that <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> had received the word of God, they sent unto them <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> was given, he offered them money,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of God may be purchased with money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For I perceive that thou art in the <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</a> of bitterness, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</a> of iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and preached the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> in many <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the Lord spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</a>, which is <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a> of great authority under <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#009">Candace</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Was returning, and <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> in his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> read <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, Go near, and join thyself to this <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> ran thither to him, and heard him read the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a>, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> that he would come up and sit with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The place of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> which he read was this, He was led as a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> to the slaughter; and like a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a>? for his life is taken from the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> this? of himself, or of some other man?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> opened his mouth, and began at the same <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a>, and preached unto him <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a> said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And he commanded the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a>; and he baptized him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And when they were come up out of the water, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the Lord caught away <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</a> saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a> was found at <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#001">Azotus</a>: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a>.<br>
