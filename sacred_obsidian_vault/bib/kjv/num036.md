 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 36</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the chief fathers of the families of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#006">Machir</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, of the families of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, came near, and spake before <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#002">Zelophehad</a> our brother unto his daughters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the jubile of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of our fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> commanded the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> according to the word of the LORD, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> hath said well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#002">Zelophehad</a>, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of their father shall they marry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So shall not the inheritance of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> remove from <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>: for every one of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall keep himself to the inheritance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of his fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, shall be wife unto one of the family of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of her father, that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Neither shall the inheritance remove from one <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> to another <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>; but every one of the tribes of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall keep himself to his own inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Even as the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, so did the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#002">Zelophehad</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#000">Mahlah</a>, Tirzah, and <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#003">Hoglah</a>, and Milcah, and <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</a>, the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#002">Zelophehad</a>, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they were married into the families of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and their inheritance remained in the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of the family of their father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> near <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
