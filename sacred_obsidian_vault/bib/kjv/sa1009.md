 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now there was a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd002.htm#009">Abiel</a>, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he had a son, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the asses of <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a> Saul's father were lost. And <a href="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he passed through <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when they were come to the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#003">Zuph</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the servant answered <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> (Beforetime in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a>: for he that is now called a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">Prophet</a> was beforetime called a <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">Seer</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a> here?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of the people to day in the high place:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> came out against them, for to go up to the high place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Now the LORD had told <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> in his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> a day before <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> came, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and thou shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> him to be captain over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that he may save my people out of the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> saw <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> drew near to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> answered <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and said, I am the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a>: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? and my family the least of all the families of the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and his servant, and brought them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</a>, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#004">cook</a>, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#004">cook</a> took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> did eat with <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> that day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> communed with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> upon the top of the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> arose, and they went out both of them, he and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, abroad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And as they were going down to the end of the city, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.<br>
