 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 30</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> sent to all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and wrote letters also to <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, that they should come to the house of the LORD at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, to keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> in the second month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the thing pleased the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a> even to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, that they should come to keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So the posts went with the letters from the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and his princes throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and according to the commandment of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, saying, Ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, turn again unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So the posts passed from city to city through the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a>: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Nevertheless divers of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a> humbled themselves, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Also in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And there assembled at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> much people to keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in the second month, a very great <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they arose and took away the altars that were in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and all the altars for <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> took they away, and cast them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then they killed the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the man of God: the priests sprinkled the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, which they received of the hand of the Levites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For there were many in the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, to sanctify them unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For a multitude of the people, even many of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#002">Issachar</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a>, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</a> otherwise than it was written. But <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> prayed for them, saying, The good LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a> every one<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the LORD hearkened to <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a>, and healed the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that were present at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> kept the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> peace offerings, and making <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#003">confession</a> to the LORD God of their fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days: and they kept other <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days with gladness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> did give to the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> a thousand bullocks and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>; and the princes gave to the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> a thousand bullocks and ten thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, with the priests and the Levites, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> that came out of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and the strangers that came out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and that dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, rejoiced.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> So there was great joy in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: for since the time of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> there was not the like in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
