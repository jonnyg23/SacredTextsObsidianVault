 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Habakkuk Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, and make it <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> upon <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a>, that he may run that readeth it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Yea also, because he transgresseth by <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Shall not all these take up a <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a> against him, and a taunting <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</a> against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Woe to him that coveteth an evil <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a> to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#000">cutting</a> off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> shall cry out of the wall, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</a> out of the timber shall answer it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Woe to him that buildeth a town with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, that puttest thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thou art filled with shame for <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the violence of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> idols?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Woe unto him that saith to the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, Awake; to the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the LORD is in his holy <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: let all the earth keep silence before him.<br>
