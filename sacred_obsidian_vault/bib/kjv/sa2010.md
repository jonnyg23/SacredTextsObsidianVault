 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after this, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> died, and <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, I will shew kindness unto <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a>, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the princes of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> their lord, Thinkest thou that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> When they told it unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Tarry at <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> until your beards be grown, and then return.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> saw that they stank before <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Maacah a thousand men, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#008">Ishtob</a> twelve thousand men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> heard of it, he sent <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the mighty men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#006">Rehob</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#008">Ishtob</a>, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and put them in array against the Syrians:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a>, and entered into the city. So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> returned from the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, they gathered themselves together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</a> sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#009">Helam</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd340.htm#002">Shobach</a> the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</a> went before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, he gathered all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> together, and passed over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#009">Helam</a>. And the Syrians set themselves in array against <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and fought with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the Syrians fled before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> slew the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote <a href="../ebd/ebd340.htm#002">Shobach</a> the captain of their <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, who died there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when all the kings that were servants to <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</a> saw that they were smitten before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, they made peace with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> any more.<br>
