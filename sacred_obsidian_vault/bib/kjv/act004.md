 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>, came upon them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> the resurrection from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</a> the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</a>, and John, and <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#009">Alexander</a>, and as many as were of the kindred of the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, were gathered together at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that by the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Neither is there <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> in any other: for there is none other name under <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> given among men, whereby we must be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now when they saw the boldness of <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, they conferred among themselves,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a> hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and we cannot deny it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> ye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this <a href="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</a> of healing was shewed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Who by the mouth of thy servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> hast said, Why did the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> rage, and the people imagine vain things?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For of a truth against thy holy child <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and the people of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, were gathered together,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and they spake the word of God with boldness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And with great power gave the apostles <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> of the resurrection of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>: and great <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> was upon them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a>, and of the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.<br>
