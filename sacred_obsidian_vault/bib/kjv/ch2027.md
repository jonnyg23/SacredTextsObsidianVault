 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</a> did: howbeit he entered not into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He built the high <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#006">Ophel</a> he built much.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Moreover he built cities in the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the forests he built castles and <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He fought also with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> gave him the same year an hundred talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and ten thousand measures of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and ten thousand of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>. So much did the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a>, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
