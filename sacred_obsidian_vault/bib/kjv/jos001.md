 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</a>, Moses' <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> From the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> and this <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> even unto the great river, the river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>, all the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, shall be your coast.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> commanded the officers of the people, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Pass through the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, spake <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Remember the word which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Your wives, your little ones, and your <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, shall remain in the land which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> gave you on this side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the LORD's servant gave you on this side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> toward the sunrising.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they answered <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> According as we hearkened unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.<br>
