 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>: and he said, Behold, here I am.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#009">Moriah</a>; and offer him there for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> rose up early in the morning, and saddled his <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>, and took two of his young men with him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his son, and clave the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> for the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then on the third day <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>; and I and the lad will go yonder and <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>, and come again to you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> took the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> of the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, and laid it upon <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#007">knife</a>; and they went both of them together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>: but where is the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> said, My son, God will provide himself a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>: so they went both of them together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> built an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> there, and laid the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> in order, and bound <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> his son, and laid him on the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> stretched forth his hand, and took the <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#007">knife</a> to slay his son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD called unto him out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>: and he said, Here am I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> caught in a thicket by his horns: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> went and took the <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>, and offered him up for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> in the stead of his son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> of the LORD it shall be seen.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of the LORD called unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> the second time,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That in blessing I will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of his enemies;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Huz his firstborn, and <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#003">Buz</a> his brother, and <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#001">Kemuel</a> the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd028.htm#001">Aram</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#005">Chesed</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd169.htm#005">Hazo</a>, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd057.htm#003">Bethuel</a> begat <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>: these eight Milcah did bear to <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</a>, Abraham's brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And his <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#002">Thahash</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a>.<br>
