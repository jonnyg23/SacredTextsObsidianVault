 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And after these things I saw another <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> come down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of devils, and the hold of every foul <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#005">cage</a> of every unclean and hateful <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For all nations have <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of the wrath of her <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, and the kings of the earth have committed <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a> with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I heard another voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For her sins have reached unto <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and God hath remembered her iniquities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a> which she hath filled fill to her double.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a> and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the kings of the earth, who have committed <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a> and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Standing afar off for the fear of her <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a>, saying, Alas, alas that great city <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the merchants of the earth shall weep and <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The merchandise of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and purple, and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#005">silk</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, and all thyine <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and all manner vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a>, and all manner vessels of most precious <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd241.htm#006">marble</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#004">cinnamon</a>, and odours, and ointments, and <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#004">frankincense</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and oil, and fine <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and beasts, and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a>, weeping and wailing,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and purple, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>, and decked with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and precious stones, and pearls!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they cast <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Rejoice over her, thou <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And a mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> took up a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the light of a <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a> shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And in her was found the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.<br>
