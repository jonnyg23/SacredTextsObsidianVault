 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</a>, who is <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of <a href="../ebd/ebd164.htm#008">Harod</a>: so that the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#006">Moreh</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>: and he sent all the rest of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> every man unto his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and retained those three hundred men: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a> was beneath him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>; for I have delivered it into thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> lay along in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> was come, behold, there was a man that told a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and, lo, a <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> tumbled into the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, and came unto a <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> lay along.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a>, a man of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for into his hand hath God delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And it was so, when <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> heard the telling of the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> also on every side of all the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>, and say, The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of the LORD, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the three companies blew the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of the LORD, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they stood every man in his place round about the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>; and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> ran, and cried, and fled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the three hundred blew the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a>, and the LORD set every man's <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> against his fellow, even throughout all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> fled to Bethshittah in <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#005">Zererath</a>, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#008">Tabbath</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> gathered themselves together out of <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>, and out of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a>, and out of all <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, and pursued after the Midianites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> sent messengers throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>. Then all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they took two princes of the Midianites, <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</a>; and they slew <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</a> they slew at the winepress of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</a>, and pursued <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, and brought the heads of <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</a> on the other side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
