 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 17</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#003">Tishbite</a>, who was of the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>, said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, As the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> these years, but according to my word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#002">Cherith</a>, that is before <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it shall be, that thou shalt <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a>; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd079.htm#002">Cherith</a>, that is before <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the ravens brought him <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> in the morning, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> in the evening; and he drank of the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it came to pass after a while, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a> dried up, because there had been no <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Arise, get thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#006">Zarephath</a>, which belongeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</a>, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So he arose and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd387.htm#006">Zarephath</a>. And when he came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> in thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</a>, but an handful of meal in a <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#006">barrel</a>, and a little oil in a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</a>: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</a> first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, The <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#006">barrel</a> of meal shall not waste, neither shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</a> of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And she went and did according to the saying of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#006">barrel</a> of meal wasted not, neither did the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</a> of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And she said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> to remembrance, and to slay my son?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD heard the voice of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> took the child, and brought him down out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said, See, thy son liveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the woman said to <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.<br>
