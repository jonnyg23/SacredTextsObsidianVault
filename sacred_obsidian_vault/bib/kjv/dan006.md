 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> It pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And over these three <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</a>; of whom <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> should have no damage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then this <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> was preferred above the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</a> and princes, because an excellent <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> was in him; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thought to set him over the whole realm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</a> and princes sought to find occasion against <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>, neither was there any error or fault found in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then these <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</a> and princes assembled together to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said thus unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a>, live for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> All the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</a> of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, he shall be cast into the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, establish the decree, and sign the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a>, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> signed the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> and the decree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> knew that the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a> toward <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then these men assembled, and found <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> praying and making supplication before his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then they came near, and spake before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, shall be cast into the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>? The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then answered they and said before the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, That <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, which is of the children of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, regardeth not thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> to deliver him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then these men assembled unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Know, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> establisheth may be changed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded, and they brought <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, and cast him into the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>. Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> spake and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sealed it with his own <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</a>, and with the <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</a> of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went to his <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a>, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when he came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a>, he cried with a lamentable voice unto <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> spake and said to <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, live for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> My God hath sent his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, have I done no hurt.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then was the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> up out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a>. So <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> was taken up out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a>, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> commanded, and they brought those men which had accused <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, and they cast them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, them, their children, and their wives; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> or ever they came at the bottom of the <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and in earth, who hath delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> from the power of the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So this <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> prospered in the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a>, and in the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</a> the Persian.<br>
