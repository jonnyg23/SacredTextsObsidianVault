 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> had heard how <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> had taken <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> and her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, so he had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a> and her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; and how the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a> had made peace with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and were among them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That they feared greatly, because <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a> was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</a>, and all the men thereof were mighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Wherefore Adonizedec <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, sent unto <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#004">Hoham</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#001">Piram</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#007">Jarmuth</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#003">Japhia</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#007">Debir</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>: for it hath made peace with <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> and with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Therefore the five kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#007">Jarmuth</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a>, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>, and made war against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a> sent unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> ascended from <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a> all night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the LORD discomfited them before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and slew them with a great slaughter at <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#008">Azekah</a>, and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, as they fled from before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> upon them unto <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#008">Azekah</a>, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> slew with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then spake <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and he said in the sight of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">Sun</a>, stand thou still upon <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>; and thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">Moon</a>, in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#002">Ajalon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> stood still, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#009">Jasher</a>? So the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> stood still in the midst of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> returned, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, saying, The five kings are found hid in a <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said, <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">Roll</a> great stones upon the mouth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and set men by it for to keep them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And all the people returned to the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a> in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Open the mouth of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#007">Jarmuth</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> called for all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And afterward <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#001">hanging</a> upon the trees until the evening.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</a> wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And that day <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a>, and smote it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a> as he did unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> passed from <a href="../ebd/ebd238.htm#006">Makkedah</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>, and fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the LORD delivered it also, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof, into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and he smote it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof as he did unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> passed from <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>, and encamped against it, and fought against it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the LORD delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a> into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then Horam <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a> came up to help <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And from <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> passed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> went up from <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a>, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>; and they fought against it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</a>; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> returned, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, to <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#007">Debir</a>; and fought against it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And he took it, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, so he did to <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#007">Debir</a>, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> thereof; as he had done also to <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>, and to her <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> commanded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</a>, and all the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>, even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And all these kings and their land did <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> take at one time, because the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> fought for <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> returned, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with him, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>.<br>
