 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 26</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> in the land, beside the first <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> that was in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> went unto <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> which I sware unto <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> thy father;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Because that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>; because she was fair to look upon.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> was sporting with <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a> his wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> called <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and said, Behold, of a <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</a> she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> envied him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> his father, the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had stopped them, and filled them with earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> departed thence, and pitched his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>, and dwelt there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> his father; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> had stopped them after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And Isaac's servants digged in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, and found there a well of springing water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the herdmen of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a> did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#008">Esek</a>; because they strove with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#008">Sitnah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#008">Rehoboth</a>; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he went up from thence to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he builded an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</a> went to him from <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</a>, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with thee;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he made them a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>, and they did eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> was forty years old when he took to wife <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#001">Judith</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#004">Beeri</a> the Hittite, and <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#006">Bashemath</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#000">Elon</a> the Hittite:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Which were a grief of mind unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> and to <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</a>.<br>
