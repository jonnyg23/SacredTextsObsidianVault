 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 30</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, that they may add <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That walk to go down into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and to trust in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Therefore shall the strength of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> be your shame, and the trust in the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> your confusion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For his princes were at <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</a>, and his ambassadors came to <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#000">Hanes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#008">viper</a> and fiery flying <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to cease from before us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> ready to fall, <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#001">swelling</a> out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</a>, or to take water withal out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#004">beacon</a> upon the top of a mountain, and as an <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</a> on an hill.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For the people shall dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And though the Lord give you the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the ornament of thy molten images of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Then shall he give the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of the increase of the earth, and it shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> and plenteous: in that day shall thy <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> feed in large pastures.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The oxen likewise and the young asses that <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> the ground shall eat <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a> fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Moreover the light of the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> shall be as the light of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and the light of the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> shall be sevenfold, as the light of <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</a> in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#000">pipe</a> to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</a> is ordained of old; yea, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> it is prepared; he hath made it <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> and large: the pile thereof is fire and much <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</a>, doth kindle it.<br>
