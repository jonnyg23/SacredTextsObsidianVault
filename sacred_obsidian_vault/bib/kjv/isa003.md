 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> and from <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> the stay and the staff, the whole stay of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and the whole stay of water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The mighty man, and the man of war, the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, and the prudent, and the ancient,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a>, and the cunning <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#007">artificer</a>, and the eloquent orator.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> is ruined, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The shew of their countenance doth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against them; and they declare their <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</a>, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of their doings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> is in your houses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> What mean ye that ye beat my people to <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#006">grind</a> the faces of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a> are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#005">mincing</a> as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of the head of the daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> In that day the Lord will take away the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#004">bravery</a> of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#004">cauls</a>, and their round <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#009">tires</a> like the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The chains, and the bracelets, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#009">mufflers</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The rings, and nose jewels,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The changeable suits of <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> The glasses, and the fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and the hoods, and the vails.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a>; and instead of well set hair <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#008">baldness</a>; and instead of a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#004">stomacher</a> a girding of <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>; and burning instead of beauty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thy men shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and thy mighty in the war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And her gates shall lament and <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.<br>
