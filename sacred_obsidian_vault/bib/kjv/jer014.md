 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word of the LORD that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> concerning the <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> is gone up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Yea, the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#000">hind</a> also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> O the hope of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</a> thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When they <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, neither shall ye have <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>; but I will give you assured peace in this place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a>, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">Sword</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> shall not be in this land; By <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> shall those prophets be consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</a> daughter of my people is broken with a great <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a>, with a very grievous blow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>!  and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>!  yea, both the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> go about into a land that they know not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Hast thou utterly rejected <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>? hath thy soul lothed <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: remember, break not thy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Are there any among the vanities of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> that can cause <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God?  therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.<br>
