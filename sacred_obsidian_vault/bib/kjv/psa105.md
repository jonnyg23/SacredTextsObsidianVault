 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 105</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Sing unto him, sing <a href="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</a> unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">Glory</a> ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> O ye seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> his servant, ye children of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> his <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He hath remembered his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Which <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> he made with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And confirmed the same unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> for a law, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, the lot of your inheritance:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Moreover he called for a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a> upon the land: he brake the whole staff of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He sent a man before them, even <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, who was sold for a servant:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> also came into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> sojourned in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He sent <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> his servant; and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> whom he had <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> He sent <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He turned their waters into <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, and slew their <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#007">lice</a> in all their coasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> He gave them <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and flaming fire in their land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> He smote their vines also and their <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</a> trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of their ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> He brought them forth also with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> He spread a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> The people asked, and he brought <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</a>, and satisfied them with the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> He opened the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> For he remembered his holy promise, and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> his servant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> with gladness:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And gave them the lands of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>: and they inherited the labour of the people;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.<br>
