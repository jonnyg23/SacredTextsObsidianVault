 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And of the last sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#007">Adonikam</a>, whose names are these, <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#007">Eliphelet</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#000">Jeiel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a>, and with them threescore males.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and <a href="../ebd/ebd385.htm#007">Zabbud</a>, and with them seventy males.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#004">Ahava</a>; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then sent I for <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#007">Eliezer</a>, for <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#005">Ariel</a>, for <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd197.htm#006">Jarib</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#001">Meshullam</a>, chief men; also for <a href="../ebd/ebd209.htm#008">Joiarib</a>, and for <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</a>, men of understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I sent them with commandment unto <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#005">Iddo</a> the chief at the place <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#004">Casiphia</a>, and I told them what they should say unto <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#005">Iddo</a>, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#004">Casiphia</a>, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#007">Sherebiah</a>, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd166.htm#001">Hashabiah</a>, and with him <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#007">Jeshaiah</a> of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#000">Merari</a>, his brethren and their sons, twenty;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Also of the Nethinims, whom <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then I proclaimed a <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> there, at the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#004">Ahava</a>, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For I was ashamed to require of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#007">Sherebiah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd166.htm#001">Hashabiah</a>, and ten of their brethren with them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And weighed unto them the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and the vessels, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the house of our God, which the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> there present, had offered:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> vessels an hundred talents, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> an hundred talents;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Also twenty basons of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#006">copper</a>, precious as <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> are a freewill <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD God of your fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and the vessels, to bring them to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto the house of our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Then we departed from the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#004">Ahava</a> on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And we came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and abode there three days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Now on the fourth day was the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#008">Meremoth</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>; and with him was <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a>; and with them was <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#002">Jozabad</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#001">Noadiah</a> the son of Binnui, Levites;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, offered burnt offerings unto the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, twelve bullocks for all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, ninety and six rams, seventy and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> lambs, twelve he goats for a <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>: all this was a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.<br>
