 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For we know that if our earthly house of this <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For we that are in this <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in appearance, and not in heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For the love of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> constraineth us; because we thus <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, that if one died for all, then were all dead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: yea, though we have known <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> after the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, yet now henceforth know we him no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore if any man be in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, he is a new <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a>: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and hath given to us the ministry of <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#004">reconciliation</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> To wit, that God was in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#004">reconciliation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now then we are ambassadors for <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For he hath made him to be <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> for us, who knew no <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; that we might be made the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God in him.<br>
