 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> To do <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</a> of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When the scorner is punished, the simple is made <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>: and when the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> in secret pacifieth <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>: and a reward in the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a> strong wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> It is joy to the just to do judgment: but <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> shall be to the workers of iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He that loveth pleasure shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man: he that loveth <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> and oil shall not be rich.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The wicked shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</a> for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> It is better to dwell in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, than with a contentious and an angry woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>; but a foolish man spendeth it up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> He that followeth after <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> findeth life, <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and honour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of the wicked is <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> A false <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.<br>
