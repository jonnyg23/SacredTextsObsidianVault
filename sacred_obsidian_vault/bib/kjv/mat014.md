 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At that time Herod the <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</a> heard of the fame of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#006">Herodias</a> danced before them, and pleased Herod.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Whereupon he promised with an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> to give her whatsoever she would ask.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#007">charger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he sent, and beheaded John in the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And his head was brought in a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#007">charger</a>, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a>, and buy themselves victuals.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He said, Bring them hither to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And straightway <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And in the fourth watch of the night <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> went unto them, walking on the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>; and they cried out for fear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But straightway <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he said, Come. And when <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And immediately <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And when they were gone over, they came into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#000">Gennesaret</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And besought him that they might only touch the <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#008">hem</a> of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.<br>
