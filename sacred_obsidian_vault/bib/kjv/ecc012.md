 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> While the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, or the light, or the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, or the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</a>, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#001">almond</a> tree shall flourish, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#006">grasshopper</a> shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Or ever the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</a> be loosed, or the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#006">bowl</a> be broken, or the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</a> be broken at the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a>, or the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</a> broken at the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#008">cistern</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> return to the earth as it was: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> shall return unto God who gave it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And moreover, because the preacher was <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The words of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<br>
 </p>
