 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 33</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And this is the blessing, wherewith <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> the man of God blessed the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> before his death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he said, The LORD came from <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, and rose up from <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> unto them; he shined forth from <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#006">Paran</a>, and he came with ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he was <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#004">Jeshurun</a>, when the heads of the people and the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were gathered together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</a> live, and not die; and let not his men be few.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And this is the blessing of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a> he said, Let thy <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#002">Thummim</a> and thy <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#005">Urim</a> be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at <a href="../ebd/ebd243.htm#006">Massah</a>, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#009">Meribah</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They shall teach <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> thy judgments, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> thy law: they shall put <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> before thee, and whole burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> upon thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a>, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a>, and for the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> that coucheth beneath,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And for the precious fruits brought forth by the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and for the precious things put forth by the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And for the precious things of the earth and <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the <a href="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</a>: let the blessing come upon the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> His <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> is like the firstling of his <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and they are the <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a> he said, Rejoice, <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a>, in thy going out; and, <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#002">Issachar</a>, in thy tents.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a> he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a>: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of the head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> of the LORD, and his judgments with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> he said, <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a> he said, O <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a> he said, Let <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a> be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thy shoes shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> There is none like unto the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#004">Jeshurun</a>, who rideth upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> then shall dwell in safety alone: the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> shall be upon a land of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>; also his heavens shall drop down <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Happy art thou, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> of thy help, and who is the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.<br>
