 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, called to be an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a>, separated unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of God,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Concerning his Son <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> our Lord, which was made of the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>, by the resurrection from the dead:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> By whom we have received <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Among whom are ye also the called of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> To all that be in <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>, beloved of God, called to be saints: <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> First, I thank my God through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For God is my <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, whom I serve with my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> by the will of God to come unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, to the end ye may be established;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> among you also, even as among other <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I am <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#000">debtor</a> both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and to the unwise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> to you that are at <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For I am not ashamed of the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: for it is the power of God unto <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> to every one that believeth; to the <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a> first, and also to the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For therein is the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For the wrath of God is revealed from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For the invisible things of him from the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</a> of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#006">Godhead</a>; so that they are without excuse:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Professing themselves to be <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, they became fools,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And changed the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</a> more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a> one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#003">reprobate</a> mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Being filled with all unrighteousness, <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, wickedness, <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>, maliciousness; full of envy, <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</a>, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#004">affection</a>, implacable, unmerciful:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<br>
