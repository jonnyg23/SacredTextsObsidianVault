 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In that day there shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a> opened to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and to the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> and for uncleanness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> to pass out of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But he shall say, I am no <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, I am an <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</a>; for man taught me to keep <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> from my youth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Awake, O <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, against my <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a> shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> is refined, and will try them as <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.<br>
