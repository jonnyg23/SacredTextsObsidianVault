 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 27</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when it was determined that we should sail into <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</a>, they delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> and certain other prisoners unto one named <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#003">Julius</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> of Augustus' band.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And entering into a ship of <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#004">Adramyttium</a>, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>; one <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#008">Aristarchus</a>, a Macedonian of <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</a>, being with us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the next day we touched at <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#003">Julius</a> courteously entreated <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> were contrary.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when we had sailed over the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</a>, we came to <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#002">Myra</a>, a city of <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#008">Lycia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And there the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> found a ship of <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#001">Alexandria</a> sailing into <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</a>; and he put us therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#002">Cnidus</a>, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</a>, over against <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#006">Salmone</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> was now already past, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> admonished them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Nevertheless the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And because the <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</a> was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#001">Phenice</a>, and there to winter; which is an <a href="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</a>, and lieth toward the south west and north west.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#002">Euroclydon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And running under a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</a> which is called <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#001">Clauda</a>, we had much work to come by the boat:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Which when they had taken up, they used <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#007">helps</a>, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#009">quicksands</a>, strake sail, and so were driven.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the third day we cast out with our own hands the <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#003">tackling</a> of the ship.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when neither <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> nor <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But after long abstinence <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</a>, and to have gained this harm and loss.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For there stood by me this night the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Saying, Fear not, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>; thou must be brought before <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#005">Adria</a>, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</a> as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And while the day was coming on, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And when he had thus spoken, he took <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> into the sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, willing to save <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.<br>
