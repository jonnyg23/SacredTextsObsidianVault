 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> heard of the fame of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And she came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with a very great train, with camels that bare <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, and very much <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and precious stones: and when she was come to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, which he told her not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the meat of his table, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And she said to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: because the LORD loved <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for ever, therefore made he thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, to do judgment and <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And she gave the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> an hundred and twenty talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a> very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a> as these which the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> gave to <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the navy also of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a>, that brought <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a>, brought in from <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#007">Ophir</a> great plenty of <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#003">almug</a> trees, and precious stones.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#003">almug</a> trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#003">almug</a> trees, nor were seen unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> gave unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</a> all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now the weight of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#009">Arabia</a>, and of the governors of the country.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> made two hundred targets of beaten <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: six hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> went to one <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#001">target</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And he made three hundred shields of beaten <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; three <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#008">pound</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> went to one <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> put them in the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made a great <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a>, and overlaid it with the best <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> had six steps, and the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> stood beside the stays.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And twelve <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> Solomon's drinking vessels were of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and all the vessels of the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> were of pure <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; none were of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: it was nothing accounted of in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had at sea a navy of <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#003">Tharshish</a> with the navy of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</a>: once in three years came the navy of <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#003">Tharshish</a>, bringing <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</a>, and apes, and peacocks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And all the earth sought to <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they brought every man his present, vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and garments, and <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> to be in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had horses brought out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#006">yarn</a>: the king's merchants received the <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#006">yarn</a> at a price.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> came up and went out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for six hundred shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and for the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, did they bring them out by their means.<br>
