 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in the month <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#007">Nisan</a>, in the twentieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> was before him: and I took up the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and gave it unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Wherefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, If it please the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto me, (the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> also <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</a> by him,) For how long shall thy <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a> be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to send me; and I set him a time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Moreover I said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, If it please the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And a letter unto <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#002">Asaph</a> the keeper of the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#006">Horonite</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a> the servant, the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</a>, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So I came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and was there three days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: neither was there any <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> with me, save the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that I rode upon.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I went out by night by the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, even before the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> well, and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a> port, and viewed the walls of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then I went on to the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</a>, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that was under me to pass.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then went I up in the night by the <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</a>, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, and so returned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that we be no more a reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#006">Horonite</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a> the servant, the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#000">Geshem</a> the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
