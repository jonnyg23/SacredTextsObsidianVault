 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Forasmuch then as <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> hath suffered for us in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> hath ceased from <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Who shall give account to him that is ready to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the quick and the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For for this cause was the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, but live according to God in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And above all things have fervent <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a> among yourselves: for <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a> shall cover the multitude of sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Use hospitality one to another without grudging.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As every man hath received the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, even so <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> If ye be reproached for the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, happy are ye; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> God on this behalf.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> Creator.<br>
