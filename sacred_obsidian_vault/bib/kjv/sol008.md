 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!  when I should find thee without, I would <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</a> thee; yea, I should not be despised.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of spiced <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> of the juice of my <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I charge you, O daughters of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Who is this that cometh up from the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</a> tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Set me as a <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> upon thine heart, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> is cruel as the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#006">drown</a> it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If she be a wall, we will build upon her a <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I am a wall, and my breasts like <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</a>: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof was to bring a thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>, must have a thousand, and those that keep the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> thereof two hundred.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou that dwellest in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</a>, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#002">roe</a> or to a young <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#004">hart</a> upon the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a>.<br>
