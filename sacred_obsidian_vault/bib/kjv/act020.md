 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And after the uproar was ceased, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#003">Greece</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, he purposed to return through <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And there accompanied him into <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd348.htm#005">Sopater</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#002">Berea</a>; and of the Thessalonians, <a href="../ebd/ebd030.htm#008">Aristarchus</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#009">Secundus</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#003">Gaius</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#009">Derbe</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a>; and of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#008">Tychicus</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#000">Trophimus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> These going before tarried for us at <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And we sailed away from <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</a> after the days of unleavened <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and came unto them to <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</a> in five days; where we abode <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there were many lights in the upper <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>, where they were gathered together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And there sat in a window a certain young man named <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#003">Eutychus</a>, being fallen into a <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> sleep: and as <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> When he therefore was come up again, and had broken <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And we went before to ship, and sailed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#003">Assos</a>, there intending to take in <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when he met with us at <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#003">Assos</a>, we took him in, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd257.htm#007">Mitylene</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#001">Chios</a>; and the next day we arrived at <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#008">Samos</a>, and tarried at <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#009">Trogyllium</a>; and the next day we came to <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#009">Miletus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> had determined to sail by <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, because he would not spend the time in <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#004">Pentecost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And from <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#009">Miletus</a> he sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</a>, and called the elders of the church.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</a>, after what manner I have been with you at all <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Serving the LORD with all <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</a> of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> toward God, and faith toward our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And now, behold, I go bound in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Save that the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a> abide me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, to testify the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of all men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> I have coveted no man's <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, or <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, and kissed him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.<br>
