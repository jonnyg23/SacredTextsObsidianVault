 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, and Silvanus, and <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a>, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, in the sight of God and our Father;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For our <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>, and in much <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</a>; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in <a href="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</a>, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And to wait for his Son from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, whom he raised from the dead, even <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, which delivered us from the wrath to come.<br>
