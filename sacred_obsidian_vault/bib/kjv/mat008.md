 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>. And immediately his <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</a> was cleansed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and offer the <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> that <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> commanded, for a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was entered into <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</a>, there came unto him a <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, beseeching him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</a>, grievously tormented.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, I will come and heal him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I say unto you, That many shall come from the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> and west, and shall sit down with <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, in the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he touched her hand, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</a> left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> and the sea; and there was a great calm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> and the sea obey him!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#001">tombs</a>, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a> us before the time?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And there was a good way off from them an <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a> of many <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</a> feeding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</a>: and, behold, the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</a> ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And, behold, the whole city came out to meet <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.<br>
