 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass when <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#000">Geshem</a> the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</a> left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> upon the gates;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#000">Geshem</a> sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#002">Ono</a>. But they thought to do me mischief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then sent <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a> his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Wherein was written, It is reported among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, according to these words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, saying, There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>: and now shall it be reported to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Afterward I came unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#001">Delaiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#005">Mehetabeel</a>, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and let us shut the <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> to save his life? I will not go in.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</a> against me: for <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a> had hired him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> My God, think thou upon <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</a> according to these their works, and on the prophetess <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#001">Noadiah</a>, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month <a href="../ebd/ebd119.htm#003">Elul</a>, in fifty and two days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Moreover in those days the nobles of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> sent many letters unto <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a>, and the letters of <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a> came unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For there were many in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#002">Shechaniah</a> the son of Arah; and his son <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</a> had taken the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#001">Meshullam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd053.htm#003">Berechiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And <a href="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</a> sent letters to put me in fear.<br>
