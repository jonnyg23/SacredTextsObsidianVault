 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> gathered all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>, and called for the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> in old time, even <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#001">Terah</a>, the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a>, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I took your father <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> from the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, and led him throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, and multiplied his seed, and gave him <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I gave unto <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a>: and I gave unto <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, to possess it; but <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> and his children went down into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I sent <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> also and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, and I plagued <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I brought your fathers out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And when they cried unto the LORD, he put <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and ye dwelt in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> a long season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I brought you into the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, which dwelt on the other side <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, arose and warred against <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and sent and called <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#009">Beor</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But I would not hearken unto <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And you went over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and came unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>: and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> fought against you, the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and the Girgashites, the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a>; and I delivered them into your hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I sent the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#004">hornet</a> before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>; but not with thy <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, nor with thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; and serve ye the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>, or the gods of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a>, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a>, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the people said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the people said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a>, and set it up there under an <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</a>, that was by the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> said unto all the people, Behold, this <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto you, lest ye deny your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And it came to pass after these things, that <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</a>, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, on the north side of the hill of <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#004">Gaash</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> served the LORD all the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and all the days of the elders that overlived <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a>, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the bones of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, which the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> brought up out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, buried they in <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a>, in a parcel of ground which <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> bought of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</a> the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</a> for an hundred <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>: and it became the inheritance of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a> his son, which was given him in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>.<br>
