 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a> and the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> of the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The people that walked in <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, upon them hath the light shined.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thou hast broken the <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of his <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a>, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; but this shall be with burning and <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</a> of fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">Counsellor</a>, The mighty God, The <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> Father, The <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</a> of Peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a> from henceforth even for ever. The <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> of the LORD of hosts will perform this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The Lord sent a word into <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and it hath lighted upon <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And all the people shall know, even <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and the inhabitant of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</a> are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#006">Rezin</a> against him, and join his enemies together;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The Syrians before, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> behind; and they shall devour <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> with open mouth. For all this his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore the LORD will cut off from <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> head and tail, <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#007">rush</a>, in one day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> that teacheth lies, he is the tail.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> on their fatherless and <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</a>: for every one is an <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</a> and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>, and they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> up like the lifting up of smoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</a> of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of his own arm:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>: and they together shall be against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>. For all this his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<br>
