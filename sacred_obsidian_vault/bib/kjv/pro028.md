 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man that oppresseth the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> is like a sweeping <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> which leaveth no food.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Better is the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Whoso keepeth the law is a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that by <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a> and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> He that turneth away his <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> from hearing the law, even his <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>: but the upright shall have good things in possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> The rich man is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> in his own conceit; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> that hath understanding searcheth him out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> When righteous men do rejoice, there is great <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a> shall prolong his days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> A man that doeth violence to the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of any person shall flee to the <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</a>; let no man stay him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> A <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> that man will transgress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> He that giveth unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.<br>
