 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then verily the first <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> made; the first, wherein was the <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</a>, and the table, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</a>; which is called the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And after the second <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> which is called the Holiest of all;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Which had the golden <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> overlaid round about with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, wherein was the golden pot that had <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</a>, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And over it the cherubims of <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, accomplishing the service of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But into the second went the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> alone once every year, not without <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> was yet standing:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</a> ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> being come an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Neither by the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of goats and calves, but by his own <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> for us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For if the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of bulls and of goats, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a> of an <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</a> sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> How much more shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, who through the eternal <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> offered himself without spot to God, purge your <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> from dead works to serve the living God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And for this cause he is the <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</a> of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>, that by means of death, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> of the transgressions that were under the first <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a>, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> For where a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a> is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For a <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a> is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Whereupon neither the first <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a> was dedicated without <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> For when <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of calves and of goats, with water, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#007">hyssop</a>, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Saying, This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</a> which God hath enjoined unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Moreover he sprinkled with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> both the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a>, and all the vessels of the ministry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And almost all things are by the law purged with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; and without shedding of <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> is no remission.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> entereth into the holy place every year with <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of others;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
