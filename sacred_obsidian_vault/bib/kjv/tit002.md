 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Titus Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That the aged men be sober, <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, temperate, sound in faith, in <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a>, in patience.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>, not false accusers, not given to much <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, teachers of good things;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> in all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God that bringeth <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> hath appeared to all men,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#008">peculiar</a> people, zealous of good works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.<br>
