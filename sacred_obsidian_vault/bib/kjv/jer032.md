 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 32</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> from the LORD in the tenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which was the eighteenth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For then the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Babylon's army besieged <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> was shut up in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>, which was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of Judah's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and he shall take it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he shall lead <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</a> thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</a>: for the right of <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> is thine to buy it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</a> mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</a>, which is in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I bought the field of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</a> my uncle's son, that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</a>, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</a>, and that which was open:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the son of Neriah, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</a>, in the sight of <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</a> mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I charged <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> before them, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto <a href="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</a> the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Thou shewest lovingkindness unto <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a> of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of his doings:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, even unto this day, and in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And hast brought forth thy people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Then came the word of the LORD unto <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>: is there any thing too hard for me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and he shall take it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, and poured out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have only provoked me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> and of my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Because of all the evil of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which they have done to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And they built the high places of <a href="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</a>, which are in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</a>, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a>, to cause <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and in my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And I will make an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a> them, and take witnesses in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, and in the places about <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> to return, saith the LORD.<br>
