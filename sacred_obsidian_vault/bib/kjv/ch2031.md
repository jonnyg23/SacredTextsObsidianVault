 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now when all this was finished, all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> that were present went out to the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and brake the images in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> also and <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> appointed the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a> of the priests and the Levites after their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a>, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a>, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> brought in abundance the firstfruits of <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and oil, and <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>, and of all the increase of the field; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#005">tithe</a> of all things brought they in abundantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And concerning the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that dwelt in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, they also brought in the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#005">tithe</a> of oxen and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#005">tithe</a> of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the chief <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</a> answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> was ruler, and <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> his brother was the next.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#003">Jehiel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#007">Azaziah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#004">Nahath</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#009">Jerimoth</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#002">Jozabad</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#006">Eliel</a>, and Ismachiah, and <a href="../ebd/ebd237.htm#007">Mahath</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</a>, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</a> his brother, at the commandment of <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the ruler of the house of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#005">Kore</a> the son of Imnah the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</a> toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And next him were <a href="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</a>, and Miniamin, and <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#002">Amariah</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#001">Shecaniah</a>, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a>, as well to the great as to the small:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Also of the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> the priests, which were in the fields of the <a href="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</a> of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And thus did <a href="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</a> throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.<br>
