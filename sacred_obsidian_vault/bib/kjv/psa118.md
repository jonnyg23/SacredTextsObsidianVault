 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 118</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> now say, that his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Let the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> now say, that his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The voice of rejoicing and <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Open to me the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> This <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> which the builders refused is become the head <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> of the corner.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> with cords, even unto the horns of the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> endureth for ever.<br>
