 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Colossians Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#009">Laodicea</a>, and for as many as have not seen my face in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</a> of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> of God, and of the Father, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For though I be absent in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, yet am I with you in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> As ye have therefore received <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> the Lord, so walk ye in him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a> of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For in him dwelleth all the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd151.htm#006">Godhead</a> bodily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> In whom also ye are circumcised with the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> by the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Blotting out the <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#009">handwriting</a> of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Let no man therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> you in meat, or in <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a>, or of the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Which are a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of things to come; but the body is of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</a> and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Wherefore if ye be dead with <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> (Touch not; taste not; handle not;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</a>, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
