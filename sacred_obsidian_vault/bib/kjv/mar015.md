 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>, and bound <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Now at that <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a> he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there was one named <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a>, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</a> in the insurrection.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And they cried out again, Crucify him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released <a href="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</a> unto them, and delivered <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#009">Praetorium</a>; and they call together the whole band.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of thorns, and put it about his head,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And began to salute him, <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of the Jews!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And they smote him on the head with a <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a>, and did spit upon him, and <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#005">bowing</a> their knees worshipped him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they compel one <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#009">Alexander</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#004">Rufus</a>, to bear his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they bring him unto the place <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#004">Golgotha</a>, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And they gave him to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> mingled with <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</a>: but he received it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</a> OF THE JEWS.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</a> was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, and buildest it in three days,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Save thyself, and come down from the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, He saved others; himself he cannot save.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Let <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> descend now from the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And when the sixth hour was come, there was <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> over the whole land until the ninth hour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And at the ninth hour <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#002">lama</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#001">sabachthani</a>? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And one ran and filled a spunge full of <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</a>, and put it on a <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a>, and gave him to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>, saying, Let alone; let us see whether <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a> will come to take him down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> cried with a loud voice, and gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> in twain from the top to the bottom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</a>, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the less and of Joses, and <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#007">Salome</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> (Who also, when he was in <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> of Arimathaea, an honourable <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a>, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> unto him the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And when he knew it of the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a>, he gave the body to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> And he bought fine <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and took him down, and wrapped him in the <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a>, and laid him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> which was hewn out of a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and rolled a <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> unto the door of the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</a> the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.<br>
