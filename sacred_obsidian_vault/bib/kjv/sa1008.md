 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> was old, that he made his sons judges over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Now the name of his firstborn was <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#005">Joel</a>; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after <a href="../ebd/ebd232.htm#008">lucre</a>, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Then all the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> gathered themselves together, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> us like all the nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But the thing displeased <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, when they said, Give us a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> us. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> prayed unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that shall reign over them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said, This will be the manner of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he will appoint him captains over <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and captains over fifties; and will set them to <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> his ground, and to reap his <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</a>, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he will take your daughters to be <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#002">confectionaries</a>, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He will take the tenth of your <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: and ye shall be his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> which ye shall have <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>; and they said, Nay; but we will have a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over us;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> That we also may be like all the nations; and that our <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> may <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD said to <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a>, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said unto the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Go ye every man unto his city.<br>
