 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then came together unto him the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, and certain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, which came from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when they saw some of his disciples eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a> of the elders.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</a> of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a> of the elders, but eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> with unwashen hands?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He answered and said unto them, Well hath <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Howbeit in vain do they <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a> of men, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</a> of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#009">Corban</a>, that is to say, a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Making the word of God of none effect through your <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</a>, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a>, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Thefts, <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</a>, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</a>, pride, foolishness:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> The woman was a <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</a>, a <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#004">Syrophenician</a> by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> out of her daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, and to cast it unto the dogs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> is gone out of thy daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And when she was come to her house, she found the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And again, departing from the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>, he came unto the sea of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a>, through the midst of the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#002">Decapolis</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And looking up to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, he sighed, and saith unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#009">Ephphatha</a>, that is, Be opened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</a> to speak.<br>
