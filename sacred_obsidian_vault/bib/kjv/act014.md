 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass in <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</a>, that they went both together into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> unto the word of his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when there was an assault made both of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</a> them,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> They were ware of it, and fled unto <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#003">Lystra</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#009">Derbe</a>, cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#007">Lycaonia</a>, and unto the region that lieth round about:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there they preached the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And there sat a certain man at <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#003">Lystra</a>, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The same heard <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when the people saw what <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#007">Lycaonia</a>, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they called <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#006">Jupiter</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#004">Mercurius</a>, because he was the chief speaker.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#006">Jupiter</a>, which was before their city, brought oxen and <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#003">garlands</a> unto the gates, and would have done <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> with the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Which when the apostles, <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, heard of, they <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Nevertheless he left not himself without <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, in that he did good, and gave us <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and fruitful <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</a>, filling our hearts with food and gladness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And there came thither certain Jews from <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</a>, who persuaded the people, and having stoned <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd101.htm#009">Derbe</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when they had preached the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#003">Lystra</a>, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a> enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And after they had passed throughout <a href="../ebd/ebd296.htm#005">Pisidia</a>, they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when they had preached the word in <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#003">Perga</a>, they went down into Attalia:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And thence sailed to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>, from whence they had been recommended to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God for the work which they fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And there they abode long time with the disciples.<br>
