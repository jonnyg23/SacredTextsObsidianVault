 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> had also received the word of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> was come up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, they that were of the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> contended with him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I was in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a> praying: and in a <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</a> I saw a <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> by four corners; and it came even to me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>; slay and eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But the voice answered me again from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a> unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he shewed us how he had seen an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</a>, and call for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a>, whose surname is <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And as I began to speak, the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> fell on them, as on us at the beginning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>; what was I, that I could withstand God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> granted <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> unto life.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now they which were scattered abroad upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</a> that arose about <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a> travelled as far as <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#001">Phenice</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And some of them were men of <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</a>, which, when they were come to <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>, spake unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#002">Grecians</a>, preaching the LORD <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: and they sent forth <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a>, that he should go as far as <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Who, when he came, and had seen the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Then departed <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</a>, for to seek <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when he had found him, he brought him unto <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And in these days came prophets from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And there stood up one of them named <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#007">Agabus</a>, and signified by the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> that there should be great <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a> throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#003">Claudius</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
