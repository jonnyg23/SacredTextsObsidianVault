 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 46</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; The <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the inner court that looketh toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> shall be shut the six working days; but on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> it shall be opened, and in the day of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> it shall be opened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> shall enter by the way of the porch of that <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> without, and shall stand by the <a href="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and the priests shall prepare his burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and his peace offerings, and he shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> at the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: then he shall go forth; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> shall not be shut until the evening.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Likewise the people of the land shall <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> at the door of this <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> that the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> shall offer unto the LORD in the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day shall be six lambs without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a> without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> shall be an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>, and the meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And in the day of the new <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> it shall be a young <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a> without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>, and six lambs, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>: they shall be without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And he shall prepare a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a> for a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> shall go out by the way of the south <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>; and he that entereth by the way of the south <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> shall go forth by the way of the north <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>: he shall not return by the way of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> shall be an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a> to a <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</a>, and an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a> to a <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#003">ram</a>, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Now when the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> shall prepare a voluntary burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> that looketh toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a>, and he shall prepare his burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and his peace offerings, as he did on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> unto the LORD of a <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> of the first year without <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</a>: thou shalt prepare it every morning.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And thou shalt prepare a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for it every morning, the sixth part of an <a href="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</a>, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</a>; a meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thus shall they prepare the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a>, and the meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> give a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But if he give a <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a>: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Moreover the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides <a href="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a> the trespass <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, where they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</a> the meat <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a>, where the ministers of the house shall <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> of the people.<br>
