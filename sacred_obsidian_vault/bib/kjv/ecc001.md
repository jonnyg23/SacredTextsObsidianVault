 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The words of the Preacher, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> One <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> passeth away, and another <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> also ariseth, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> filled with hearing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> I the Preacher was <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I have seen all the works that are done under the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</a> and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.<br>
