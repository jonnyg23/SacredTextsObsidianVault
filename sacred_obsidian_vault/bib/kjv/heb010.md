 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> For the law having a <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a> of sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For it is not possible that the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of bulls and of goats should take away sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">Sacrifice</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> thou hast had no pleasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Above when he said, <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">Sacrifice</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> and burnt offerings and <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> By the which will we are sanctified through the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the body of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> once for all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And every <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> standeth daily ministering and <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> But this man, after he had offered one <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For by one <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Whereof the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> also is a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> to us: for after that he had said before,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> This is the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now where remission of these is, there is no more <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</a>, that is to say, his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And having an high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> over the house of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Let us draw near with a true heart in full <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</a> of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</a>, and our bodies washed with pure water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Let us hold <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> that promised;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For if we <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> for sins,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> He that despised Moses' law died without <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a> under two or three witnesses:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Of how much sorer <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a>, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> his people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a>; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> a better and an enduring substance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.<br>
