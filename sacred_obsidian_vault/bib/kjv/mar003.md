 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And he entered again into the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a>; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> day; that they might accuse him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the <a href="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</a> days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when he had looked round about on them with <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> went forth, and straightway took counsel with the <a href="../ebd/ebd176.htm#005">Herodians</a> against him, how they might destroy him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</a> followed him, and from Judaea,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and from <a href="../ebd/ebd186.htm#008">Idumaea</a>, and from beyond <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>; and they about <a href="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</a>, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> he surnamed <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</a>, and John the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a>; and he surnamed them <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#004">Boanerges</a>, which is, The sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#009">Bartholomew</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#003">Matthew</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#005">Alphaeus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd363.htm#001">Thaddaeus</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</a>, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> which came down from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> said, He hath <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</a>, and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the devils casteth he out devils.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> cast out <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And if <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Because they said, He hath an unclean <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.<br>
