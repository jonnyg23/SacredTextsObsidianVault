 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 42</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>: but now mine eye seeth thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</a>, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Therefore take unto you now <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> bullocks and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#006">Bildad</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd341.htm#008">Shuhite</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#000">Zophar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#000">Naamathite</a> went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the LORD turned the <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, and six thousand camels, and a thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</a> of oxen, and a thousand she asses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He had also <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> sons and three daughters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he called the name of the first, <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#001">Jemima</a>; and the name of the second, <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#003">Kezia</a>; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> So Job died, being old and full of days.<br>
 </p>
