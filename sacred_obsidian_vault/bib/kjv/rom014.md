 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> him that eateth: for God hath received him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For to this end <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But why dost thou <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Let us not therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> one another any more: but <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> For the kingdom of God is not meat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; but <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, and peace, and joy in the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For he that in these things serveth <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is acceptable to God, and approved of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> It is good neither to eat <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, nor to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
