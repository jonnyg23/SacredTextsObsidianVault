 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Blessed are the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>: for theirs is the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Blessed are they that <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>: for they shall be comforted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: for they shall be filled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Ye are the <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a> of the earth: but if the <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a> have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Neither do men light a <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a>, and put it under a bushel, but on a <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</a>; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</a> your Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> For verily I say unto you, Till <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> and earth pass, one <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#009">jot</a> or one <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#006">tittle</a> shall in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For I say unto you, That except your <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> shall exceed the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a>, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#001">Raca</a>, shall be in danger of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a>: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Therefore if thou bring thy <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Leave there thy <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a> before the <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a>, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Agree with thine <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> deliver thee to the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#003">farthing</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</a> after her hath committed <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a> with her already in his heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</a> of divorcement:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a>, causeth her to commit <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; for it is God's <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Nor by the earth; for it is his <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</a>: neither by <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; for it is the city of the great <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</a>, turn to him the other also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</a>, let him have thy <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#009">cloak</a> also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#007">borrow</a> of thee turn not thou away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a> them that <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: for he maketh his <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> on the just and on the unjust.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="046">46</a> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="047">47</a> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="048">48</a> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> is perfect.<br>
