 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> came up against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and built <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> brought out <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, that dwelt at <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> There is a <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; go, break thy <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> with <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that he may depart from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And Benhadad hearkened unto <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and they smote <a href="../ebd/ebd187.htm#002">Ijon</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a>, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> heard it, that he left off building of <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, and let his work cease.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> took all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and they carried away the stones of <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, and the timber thereof, wherewith <a href="../ebd/ebd040.htm#008">Baasha</a> was building; and he built therewith <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#004">Geba</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And at that time <a href="../ebd/ebd162.htm#003">Hanani</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> escaped out of thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Were not the Ethiopians and the <a href="../ebd/ebd232.htm#004">Lubims</a> a huge <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> was wroth with the <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</a>, and put him in a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> oppressed some of the people the same time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And, behold, the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a>, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</a> slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</a> prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.<br>
