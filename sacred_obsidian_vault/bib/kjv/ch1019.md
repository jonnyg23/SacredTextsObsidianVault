 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now it came to pass after this, that <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> died, and his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, I will shew kindness unto <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</a>, because his father shewed kindness to me. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> came into the land of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a>, to comfort him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But the princes of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a>, Thinkest thou that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Then there went certain, and told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said, Tarry at <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> until your beards be grown, and then return.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> saw that they had made themselves odious to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</a> and the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> sent a thousand talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> to hire them chariots and horsemen out of <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</a>, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#005">Zobah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</a> and his people; who came and pitched before <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#000">Medeba</a>. And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> heard of it, he sent <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of the mighty men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> came out, and put the battle in array before the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now when <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and put them in array against the Syrians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> his brother, and entered into the city. Then <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</a> went before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it was told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; and he gathered all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and passed over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But the Syrians fled before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> slew of the Syrians <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</a> saw that they were put to the worse before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, they made peace with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a> any more.<br>
