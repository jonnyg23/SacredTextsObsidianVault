 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> chose him three thousand men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; whereof two thousand were with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a> and in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>, and a thousand were with <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> smote the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#004">Geba</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> heard of it. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> heard say that <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> had smitten a <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and that <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> also was had in <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>. And the people were called together after <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> gathered themselves together to fight with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a>, eastward from Bethaven.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> When the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And some of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> went over <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> to the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#007">Gad</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</a>. As for <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, he was yet in <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, and all the people followed him trembling.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he tarried <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days, according to the set time that <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> had appointed: but <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> came not to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>; and the people were scattered from him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Bring hither a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> the burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>, behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> came; and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> went out to meet him, that he might salute him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said, What hast thou done? And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> gathered themselves together at <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore said I, The <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> will come down now upon me to <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</a> arose, and gat him up from <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> encamped in <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the spoilers came out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd279.htm#009">Ophrah</a>, unto the land of Shual:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#009">Zeboim</a> toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now there was no <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#006">smith</a> found throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> said, Lest the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a> make them swords or spears:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But all the Israelites went down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, to sharpen every man his share, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#003">coulter</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd244.htm#007">mattock</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a>: but with <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and with <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> his son was there found.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went out to the <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#003">passage</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</a>.<br>
