 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Nahum Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> He that dasheth in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, as the excellency of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a> branches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a> of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</a>: the chariots shall be with flaming <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#008">torches</a> in the day of his preparation, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees shall be terribly shaken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#008">torches</a>, they shall run like the lightnings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> shall be dissolved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And Huzzab shall be led away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#002">tabering</a> upon their breasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</a> is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Take ye the spoil of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, take the spoil of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>: for there is none end of the store and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> out of all the pleasant furniture.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Where is the dwelling of the <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, and the feedingplace of the young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> The lion did tear in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall devour thy young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a>: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.<br>
