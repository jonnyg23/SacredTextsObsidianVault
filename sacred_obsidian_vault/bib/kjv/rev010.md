 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 10</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And I saw another mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> come down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, clothed with a <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>: and a <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#009">rainbow</a> was upon his head, and his face was as it were the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and his feet as pillars of fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thunders uttered their voices.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> saying unto me, <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">Seal</a> up those things which the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thunders uttered, and write them not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But in the days of the voice of the seventh <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, when he shall begin to sound, the <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</a> of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the voice which I heard from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And I went unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a>, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>: and as soon as I had eaten it, my <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.<br>
