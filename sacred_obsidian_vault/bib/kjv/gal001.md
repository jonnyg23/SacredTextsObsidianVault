 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a>, an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a>, (not of men, neither by man, but by <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of <a href="../ebd/ebd141.htm#004">Galatia</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> To whom be <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> unto another <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But though we, or an <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, preach any other <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But I certify you, brethren, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> which was preached of me is not after man.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For ye have heard of my <a href="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</a> in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>; immediately I conferred not with <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Neither went I up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to them which were apostles before me; but I went into <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#009">Arabia</a>, and returned again unto <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Then after three years I went up to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to see <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and abode with him fifteen days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But other of the apostles saw I none, save <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</a> the Lord's brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Afterwards I came into the regions of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they glorified God in me.<br>
