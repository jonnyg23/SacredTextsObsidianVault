 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</a> alone;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And sent <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a>, our brother, and <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> of God, and our fellowlabourer in the <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> That no man should be moved by these <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</a>: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</a>; even as it came to pass, and ye know.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But now when <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</a> came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a>, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For now we live, if ye stand <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> in the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, direct our way unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a> before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> with all his saints.<br>
