 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> I made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Is not <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> to the wicked? and a strange <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</a> to the workers of iniquity?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Let me be weighed in an even <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a> that God may know mine integrity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</a> hath cleaved to mine hands;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then let my wife <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#006">grind</a> unto another, and let others <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a> down upon her.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For it is a fire that consumeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, and would root out all mine increase.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> If I have withheld the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> without covering;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#006">fleece</a> of my <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</a>, and mine arm be broken from the bone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> If I have made <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> my hope, or have said to the fine <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, Thou art my confidence;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> If I beheld the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> when it shined, or the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> walking in brightness;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a>: for I should have denied the God that is above.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> If I rejoice at the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Neither have I suffered my mouth to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a> by wishing a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> to his soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> If the men of my <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> said not, Oh that we had of his <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>!  we cannot be satisfied.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> did not <a href="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</a> in the street: but I opened my <a href="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</a> to the traveller.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> If I covered my transgressions as <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</a>, by hiding mine iniquity in my <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine <a href="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</a> had written a book.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> would I go near unto him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> Let thistles grow instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#008">cockle</a> instead of <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a>. The words of Job are ended.<br>
