 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 14</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At that time <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#006">Abijah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> fell sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>; and get thee to <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>: behold, there is <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, which told me that I should be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</a>, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</a>, and came to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a>. But <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a>, Behold, the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it was so, when <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Go, tell <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> over my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> the kingdom away from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and hast cast me behind thy back:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, and will cut off from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and will take away the remnant of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, as a man taketh away <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</a>, till it be all gone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Him that dieth of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> for him, and bury him: for he only of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> shall come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> in the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, who shall cut off the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> that day: but what? even now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For the LORD shall smite <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</a> is shaken in the water, and he shall root up <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And he shall give <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> up because of the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, who did <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>, and who made <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</a> of the door, the child died;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And they buried him; and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a>, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the days which <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#008">Nadab</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> reigned in <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>. <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to put his name there. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#008">Naamah</a> an Ammonitess.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</a> with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And there were also <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#006">sodomites</a> in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And it came to pass in the fifth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a>, that Shishak <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> came up against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> had made.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>, which kept the door of the king's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And it was so, when the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> went into the house of the LORD, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> bare them, and brought them back into the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And there was war between <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</a> all their days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd263.htm#008">Naamah</a> an Ammonitess. And <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#007">Abijam</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
