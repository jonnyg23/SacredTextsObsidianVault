 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 5</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a> for them, that we may eat, and live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, because of the <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>, and that upon our lands and vineyards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Yet now our <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is as the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> our enemies?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>: I pray you, let us leave off this <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and the oil, that ye exact of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an <a href="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</a> of them, that they should do according to this promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> said, <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of <a href="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of the governor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, beside forty shekels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> that are about us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now that which was prepared for me daily was one <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> and six choice <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>: yet for all this required not I the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> of the governor, because the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</a> was heavy upon this people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.<br>
