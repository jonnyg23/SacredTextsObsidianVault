 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Numbers Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Avenge the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Of every <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> a thousand, throughout all the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, shall ye send to the war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So there were delivered out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, a thousand of every <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>, twelve thousand armed for war.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> sent them to the war, a thousand of every <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a>, them and <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</a> to blow in his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>; and they slew all the males.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And they slew the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#002">Rekem</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd396.htm#005">Zur</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd184.htm#009">Hur</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#000">Reba</a>, five kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a> also the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#009">Beor</a> they slew with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> took all the women of <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</a> captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and all their flocks, and all their goods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> at the plains of <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, which are by <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a> near <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and all the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>, went forth to meet them without the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> was wroth with the officers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a>, with the captains over <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Behold, these caused the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, through the counsel of <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</a>, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of <a href="../ebd/ebd289.htm#006">Peor</a>, and there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</a> among the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And do ye abide without the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Only the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd367.htm#005">tin</a>, and the lead,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, and afterward ye shall come into the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the LORD spake unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, thou, and <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, and the chief fathers of the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#001">levy</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a> unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#000">beeves</a>, and of the asses, and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Take it of their half, and give it unto <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, for an heave <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd051.htm#000">beeves</a>, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> did as the LORD commanded <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#006">booty</a>, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>,<br>
