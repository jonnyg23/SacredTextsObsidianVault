 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 John Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</a> be with you, <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is come in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>. This is a deceiver and an <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#000">antichrist</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, he hath both the Father and the Son.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The children of thy elect sister greet thee. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
