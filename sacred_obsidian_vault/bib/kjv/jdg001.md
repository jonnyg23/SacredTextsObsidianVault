 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 1</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</a> it came to pass, that the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> first, to fight against them?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD said, <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> went with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went up; and the LORD delivered the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a> into their hand: and they slew of them in <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#000">Bezek</a> ten thousand men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And they found <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#005">Adonibezek</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#000">Bezek</a>: and they fought against him, and they slew the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#005">Adonibezek</a> fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#005">Adonibezek</a> said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and there he died.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Now the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> had fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and set the city on fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And afterward the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went down to fight against the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went against the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> that dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>: (now the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a> before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew <a href="../ebd/ebd336.htm#002">Sheshai</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#003">Ahiman</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#001">Talmai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#007">Debir</a>: and the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd099.htm#007">Debir</a> before was Kirjathsepher:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</a> said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#001">Achsah</a> my daughter to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#003">Othniel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd217.htm#003">Kenaz</a>, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#001">Achsah</a> his daughter to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</a> said unto her, What wilt thou?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</a> gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which lieth in the south of <a href="../ebd/ebd028.htm#000">Arad</a>; and they went and dwelt among the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went with <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</a> his brother, and they slew the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> that inhabited <a href="../ebd/ebd390.htm#009">Zephath</a>, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#002">Hormah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Also <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</a> with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</a> with the coast thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the LORD was with <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, because they had chariots of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And they gave <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</a>, as <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said: and he expelled thence the three sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd022.htm#005">Anak</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> did not drive out the <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a> that inhabited <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</a> dwell with the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, they also went up against <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>: and the LORD was with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> sent to descry <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>. (Now the name of the city before was <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</a>.)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</a> saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>; but they let go the man and all his family.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And the man went into the land of the <a href="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</a>, and built a city, and called the name thereof <a href="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</a>: which is the name thereof unto this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Neither did <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a> drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#005">Taanach</a> and her towns, nor the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#003">Dor</a> and her towns, nor the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#009">Ibleam</a> and her towns, nor the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#004">Megiddo</a> and her towns: but the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> would dwell in that land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And it came to pass, when <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> was strong, that they put the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</a>, and did not utterly drive them out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Neither did <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> drive out the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> that dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a>; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> dwelt in <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a> among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Neither did <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</a> drive out the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd221.htm#003">Kitron</a>, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a> dwelt among them, and became tributaries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Neither did <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</a> drive out the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#001">Accho</a>, nor the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</a>, nor of <a href="../ebd/ebd015.htm#002">Ahlab</a>, nor of <a href="../ebd/ebd007.htm#003">Achzib</a>, nor of <a href="../ebd/ebd172.htm#000">Helbah</a>, nor of <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#002">Aphik</a>, nor of <a href="../ebd/ebd309.htm#006">Rehob</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But the Asherites dwelt among the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> Neither did <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</a> drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</a>, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> forced the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> would dwell in <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd175.htm#001">Heres</a> in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a> prevailed, so that they became tributaries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And the coast of the <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</a> was from the going up to <a href="../ebd/ebd016.htm#004">Akrabbim</a>, from the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and upward.<br>
