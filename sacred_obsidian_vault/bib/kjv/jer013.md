 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 13</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> So I got a <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Take the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>, and hide it there in a hole of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> So I went, and hid it by <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>, as the LORD commanded me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>, and take the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then I went to <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a>, and digged, and took the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> was marred, it was profitable for nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the great pride of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> them, shall even be as this <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>, which is good for nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For as the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a> cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the whole house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: but they would not hear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, Every <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> shall be filled with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</a> shall be filled with <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, with drunkenness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>, but destroy them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Hear ye, and give <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Give <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> to the LORD your God, before he cause <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the <a href="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</a> of death, and make it gross <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Say unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> and to the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a>, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of your <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> shall be carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> all of it, it shall be wholly carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me?  For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</a> his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</a> of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>! wilt thou not be made <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>? when shall it once be?<br>
