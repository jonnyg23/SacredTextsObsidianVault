 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 52</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>; put on thy beautiful garments, O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Shake thyself from the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>; arise, and sit down, O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: loose thyself from the <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, O <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>; that saith unto <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, Thy God reigneth!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>, that bear the vessels of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> will be your <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#004">rereward</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.<br>
