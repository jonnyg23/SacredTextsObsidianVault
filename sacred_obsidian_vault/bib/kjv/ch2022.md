 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> his youngest son <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> had slain all the eldest. So <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> reigned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Forty and two years old was <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. His mother's name also was <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He also walked in the ways of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>: for his mother was his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a> to do wickedly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> He walked also after their counsel, and went with <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> to war against <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a> at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he returned to be healed in <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a> because of the wounds which were given him at <a href="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</a>, when he fought with <a href="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went down to see <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</a>, because he was sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> was of God by coming to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</a>: for when he was come, he went out with <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a> against <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd273.htm#005">Nimshi</a>, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass, that, when <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a> was executing judgment upon the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</a>, and found the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the sons of the brethren of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>, that ministered to <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>, he slew them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he sought <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>: and they caught him, (for he was hid in <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>,) and brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a>: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</a>, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> had no power to keep still the kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> the mother of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a> saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, took <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</a>, the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a>, (for she was the sister of <a href="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</a>,) hid him from <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a>, so that she slew him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and <a href="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</a> reigned over the land.<br>
