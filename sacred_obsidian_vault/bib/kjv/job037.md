 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 37</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> He directeth it under the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</a> unto the ends of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For he saith to the <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a>, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and to the great <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> of his strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> By the breath of God <a href="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</a> is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Also by watering he wearieth the thick <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>: he scattereth his bright <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for <a href="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> to shine?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of <a href="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</a>: he will not afflict.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> of heart.<br>
