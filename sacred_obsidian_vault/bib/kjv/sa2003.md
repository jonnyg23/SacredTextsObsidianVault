 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Now there was long war between the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> waxed weaker and weaker.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> were sons born in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>: and his firstborn was <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd014.htm#006">Ahinoam</a> the Jezreelitess;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And his second, <a href="../ebd/ebd080.htm#006">Chileab</a>, of <a href="../ebd/ebd003.htm#002">Abigail</a> the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd264.htm#005">Nabal</a> the Carmelite; and the third, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</a> the son of Maacah the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd358.htm#001">Talmai</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the fourth, <a href="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd158.htm#009">Haggith</a>; and the fifth, <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#005">Shephatiah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#008">Abital</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the sixth, Ithream, by <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#006">Eglah</a> David's wife. These were born to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> and the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> made himself strong for the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> had a <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd314.htm#008">Rizpah</a>, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's <a href="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then was <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> do shew kindness this day unto the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So do God to <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, even so I do to him;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> To translate the kingdom from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and to set up the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and over <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</a> even to <a href="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And he could not answer <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> a word again, because he feared him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> sent messengers to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he said, Well; I will make a <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a>, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#003">Phaltiel</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#009">Bahurim</a>. Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> unto him, Go, return. And he returned.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> had communication with the elders of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, Ye sought for <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in times past to be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, saying, By the hand of my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> I will save my people <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> out of the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, and out of the hand of all their enemies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> also spake in the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>: and <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> went also to speak in the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a> all that seemed good to <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and that seemed good to the whole house of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, and twenty men with him. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> and the men that were with him a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, I will arise and go, and will gather all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> unto my lord the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that they may make a <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sent <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> away; and he went in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And, behold, the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> was not with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> that was with him were come, they told <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, saying, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a> came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> came to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, and said, What hast thou done? behold, <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thou knowest <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a>, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> was come out from <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, he sent messengers after <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>, which brought him again from the well of <a href="../ebd/ebd345.htm#005">Sirah</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> knew it not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> was returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> took him aside in the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</a> his brother.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And afterward when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Let it rest on the head of <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, or that lacketh <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</a> his brother slew <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>, because he had slain their brother <a href="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</a> at <a href="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</a> in the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a>, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> before <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> himself followed the <a href="../ebd/ebd058.htm#003">bier</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And they buried <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</a>: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> lifted up his voice, and wept at the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>; and all the people wept.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> lamented over <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a>, and said, Died <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> as a fool dieth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And when all the people came to cause <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> to eat meat while it was yet day, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, or ought else, till the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> be down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> did pleased all the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> For all the people and all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> understood that day that it was not of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to slay <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> and a great man fallen this day in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> And I am this day weak, though anointed <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>; and these men the sons of <a href="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</a> be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.<br>
