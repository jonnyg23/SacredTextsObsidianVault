 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Timothy Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> men, who shall be able to teach others also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> him to be a soldier.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</a> that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Remember that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> of the seed of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was raised from the dead according to my <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> with eternal <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> It is a <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a> saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> If we believe not, yet he abideth <a href="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</a>: he cannot deny himself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And their word will eat as doth a <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#003">canker</a>: of whom is Hymenaeus and <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#007">Philetus</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</a>, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> depart from iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But in a great house there are not only vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, but also of <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a> and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, faith, <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</a>, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> In <a href="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</a> instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</a> to the acknowledging of the truth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And that they may recover themselves out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a>, who are taken <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> by him at his will.<br>
