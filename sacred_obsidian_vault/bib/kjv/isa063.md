 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 63</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Who is this that cometh from <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, with dyed garments from <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</a>?  this that is glorious in his <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, mighty to save.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Wherefore art thou red in thine <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#001">winefat</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and trample them in my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>; and their <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> unto me; and my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, it upheld me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will tread down the people in mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, and make them <a href="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</a> in my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a>, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</a> toward the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</a> of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But they rebelled, and vexed his holy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then he remembered the days of old, <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a> of his flock? where is he that put his holy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> within him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> That led them by the right hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> name?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> That led them through the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a>, as an horse in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, that they should not stumble?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> As a <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> goeth down into the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Look down from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and behold from the <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a> and of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: where is thy <a href="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</a> and thy strength, the sounding of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</a> and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Doubtless thou art our father, though <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</a> be ignorant of us, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</a>; thy name is from <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The people of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</a> have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.<br>
