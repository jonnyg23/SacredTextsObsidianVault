 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 28</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</a> was called <a href="../ebd/ebd247.htm#006">Melita</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a>, and because of the cold.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#008">viper</a> out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when the barbarians saw the venomous <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And he shook off the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> into the fire, and felt no harm.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</a>, whose name was <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#000">Publius</a>; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And it came to pass, that the father of <a href="../ebd/ebd302.htm#000">Publius</a> lay sick of a <a href="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</a> and of a bloody flux: to whom <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the <a href="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</a>, came, and were healed:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And after three months we departed in a ship of <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#001">Alexandria</a>, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And landing at <a href="../ebd/ebd355.htm#001">Syracuse</a>, we tarried there three days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to <a href="../ebd/ebd312.htm#008">Rhegium</a>: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#000">Puteoli</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> days: and so we went toward <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> saw, he thanked God, and took courage.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And when we came to <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> delivered the prisoners to the captain of the <a href="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</a>: but <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass, that after three days <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> into the hands of the Romans.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#001">appeal</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</a>; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> I am bound with this <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</a>, we know that every where it is spoken against.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>, both out of the law of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</a> by <a href="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> unto our fathers,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Be it known therefore unto you, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a> of God is sent unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and that they will hear it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.<br>
