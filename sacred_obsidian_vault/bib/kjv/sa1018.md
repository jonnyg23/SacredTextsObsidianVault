 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, that the soul of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> was knit with the soul of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> loved him as his own soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> made a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, because he loved him as his own soul.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and his garments, even to his <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and to his <a href="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</a>, and to his <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> went out whithersoever <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass as they came, when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, singing and dancing, to meet <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the women answered one another as they played, and said, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> hath slain his <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> his ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and to me they have ascribed but <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>: and what can he have more but the kingdom?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> eyed <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> from that day and forward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> from God came upon <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</a> in Saul's hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> cast the <a href="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</a>; for he said, I will smite <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> even to the wall with it. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> avoided out of his presence twice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was afraid of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Wherefore when <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> loved <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, because he went out and came in before them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Behold my <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> daughter <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#007">Merab</a>, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> be upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, that I should be son in law to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But it came to pass at the time when <a href="../ebd/ebd248.htm#007">Merab</a> Saul's daughter should have been given to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that she was given unto <a href="../ebd/ebd010.htm#006">Adriel</a> the Meholathite to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> Saul's daughter loved <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>: and they told <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, and the thing pleased him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, I will give him her, that she may be a <a href="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</a> to him, and that the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> may be against him. Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> commanded his servants, saying, Commune with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> secretly, and say, Behold, the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man, and lightly esteemed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> told him, saying, On this manner spake <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> said, Thus shall ye say to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, The <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> desireth not any <a href="../ebd/ebd106.htm#009">dowry</a>, but an hundred foreskins of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> thought to make <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> fall by the hand of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And when his servants told <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> these words, it pleased <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Wherefore <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> two hundred men; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#008">tale</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, that he might be the king's son in law. And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> gave him <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> his daughter to wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> saw and knew that the LORD was with <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and that <a href="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</a> Saul's daughter loved him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> was yet the more afraid of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a> became David's enemy continually.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Then the princes of the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a> went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>; so that his name was much set by.<br>
