 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 18</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The priests the Levites, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</a>, shall have no part nor inheritance with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, whether it be <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>; and they shall give unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The firstfruit also of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</a>, of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>, and of thine oil, and the first of the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#006">fleece</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, shalt thou give him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For the LORD thy God hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> him out of all thy tribes, to stand to <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And if a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</a> come from any of thy gates out of all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Then he shall <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</a> in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth <a href="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</a>, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#006">witch</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Or a <a href="../ebd/ebd078.htm#000">charmer</a>, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#000">wizard</a>, or a <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#001">necromancer</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For all that do these things are an <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">Prophet</a> from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in <a href="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</a> in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I will raise them up a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">Prophet</a> from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> When a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.<br>
