 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And there appeared a great wonder in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; a woman clothed with the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> under her feet, and upon her head a <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of twelve <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And she being with child cried, travailing in <a href="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</a>, and pained to be delivered.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And there appeared another wonder in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and behold a great red <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a>, having <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> heads and ten horns, and <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> crowns upon his heads.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And his tail drew the third part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and did cast them to the earth: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the woman fled into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And there was war in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: <a href="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</a> and his angels fought against the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> fought and his angels,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the great <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> was cast out, that old <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>, called the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">Devil</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I heard a loud voice saying in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, Now is come <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd006.htm#002">accuser</a> of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And they overcame him by the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</a>, and by the word of their <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a>; and they loved not their lives unto the death.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</a> is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And to the woman were given two wings of a great <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</a>, that she might <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</a> into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</a> cast out of his mouth water as a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> which the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> cast out of his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</a> was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
