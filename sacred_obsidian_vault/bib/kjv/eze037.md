 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 37</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> which was full of bones,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>; and, lo, they were very dry.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a>, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And shall put my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and for the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, the stick of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> and for all the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his companions:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</a>, which is in the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, and the tribes of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> from among the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a>, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; and one <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> my servant shall be <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over them; and they all shall have one <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a> my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> shall be their <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Moreover I will make a <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> of peace with them; it shall be an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> in the midst of them for evermore.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> My <a href="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</a> also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> shall know that I the LORD do sanctify <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, when my <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> shall be in the midst of them for evermore.<br>
