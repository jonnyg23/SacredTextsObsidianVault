 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In his days <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> came up, and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And the LORD sent against him <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd076.htm#002">Chaldees</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of the Syrians, and <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of the Moabites, and <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and sent them against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</a>, according to all that he did;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And also for the innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> that he shed: for he filled <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> with innocent <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>; which the LORD would not <a href="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</a> of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> slept with his fathers: and <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> his son reigned in his stead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> came not again any more out of his land: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> had taken from the river of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> unto the river <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</a> all that pertained to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> three months. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd270.htm#000">Nehushta</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> At that time the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> came up against <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and the city was besieged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> went out to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> took him in the eighth year of his reign.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a> all the vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> which <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> had made in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a> of the LORD, as the LORD had said.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he carried away all <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he carried away <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#000">Jehoiachin</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And all the men of might, even <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> brought <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> made <a href="../ebd/ebd243.htm#009">Mattaniah</a> his father's brother <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> in his stead, and changed his name to <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd161.htm#009">Hamutal</a>, the daughter of <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that <a href="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</a> had done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For through the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD it came to pass in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, until he had cast them out from his presence, that <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> rebelled against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>.<br>
