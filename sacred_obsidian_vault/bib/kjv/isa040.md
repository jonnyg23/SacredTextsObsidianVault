 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 40</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Speak ye comfortably to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> The voice of him that crieth in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> a <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a> for our God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Every <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD shall be revealed, and all <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> withereth, the flower fadeth: because the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> O <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, Behold your God!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> He shall feed his flock like a <a href="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</a>: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and shall gently lead those that are with young.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> with the span, and comprehended the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Who hath directed the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD, or being his <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</a> hath taught him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#009">bucket</a>, and are counted as the small <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</a>: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> The workman melteth a graven image, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#003">goldsmith</a> spreadeth it over with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and casteth <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> chains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a>, and spreadeth them out as a <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a> to dwell in:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their <a href="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</a> by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Why sayest thou, O <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and speakest, O <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.<br>
