 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 15</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then answered <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</a>, and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Should a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> man utter vain knowledge, and fill his <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> wind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</a> before God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</a> than thy father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> That thou turnest thy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> What is man, that he should be <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a>? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not <a href="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</a> in his sight.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Which <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</a> passed among them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</a> shall come upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> He believeth not that he shall return out of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and he is waited for of the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> He wandereth abroad for <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a> is ready at his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> ready to the battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> He runneth upon him, even on his <a href="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</a>, upon the thick <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#009">bosses</a> of his bucklers:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</a> on his flanks.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</a> thereof upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> He shall not depart out of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> shall not be green.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> He shall shake off his unripe <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#004">grape</a> as the <a href="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</a>, and shall cast off his flower as the <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</a> of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</a> prepareth deceit.<br>
