 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 44</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The word that came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, which dwell at <a href="../ebd/ebd254.htm#003">Migdol</a>, and at Tahpanhes, and at <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</a>, and in the country of <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#007">Pathros</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and upon all the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, in that they went to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a> to turn from their wickedness, to burn no <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto other gods.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Wherefore my <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> and mine <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, to leave you none to remain;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto other gods in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a> and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And I will take the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that have set their faces to go into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; they shall even be consumed by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, and a reproach.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, as I have punished <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, and by the pestilence:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> So that none of the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, which are gone into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, in <a href="../ebd/ebd286.htm#007">Pathros</a>, answered <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a>, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and to pour out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But since we left off to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and to pour out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when we burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and poured out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to <a href="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</a> her, and pour out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto her, without our men?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> that ye burned in the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</a>, without an inhabitant, as at this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Because ye have burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a>, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</a> said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> that are in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a> that we have vowed, to burn <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> to the <a href="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and to pour out <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>, and surely perform your <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> that dwell in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> that are in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall be consumed by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> and by the <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</a>, until there be an end of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Yet a small number that escape the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall return out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and all the remnant of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, that are gone into the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave <a href="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> into the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a>, his enemy, and that sought his life.<br>
