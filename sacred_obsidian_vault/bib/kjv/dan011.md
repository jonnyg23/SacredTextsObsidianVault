 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 11</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Also I in the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd245.htm#009">Mede</a>, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in <a href="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</a>; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And a mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But out of a <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And shall also carry captives into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>; and he shall continue more years than the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a>: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>: but he shall not be strengthened by it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And in those times there shall many stand up against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>; but they shall fall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> So the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north shall come, and cast up a <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#008">taxes</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>, nor in battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And with the arms of a <a href="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</a> shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And after the <a href="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</a> made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south with a great army; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> For the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#003">Chittim</a> shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the <a href="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</a> of strength, and shall take away the daily <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a>, and they shall place the <a href="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</a> that maketh desolate.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> And such as do wickedly against the <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and by flame, by <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, and by spoil, many days.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="036">36</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="037">37</a> Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="038">38</a> But in his estate shall he honour the God of <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</a>: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="039">39</a> Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="040">40</a> And at the time of the end shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the south push at him: and the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="041">41</a> He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</a>, and the chief of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="042">42</a> He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall not escape.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="043">43</a> But he shall have power over the treasures of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and over all the precious things of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="044">44</a> But tidings out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</a> and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</a> to destroy, and utterly to make away many.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="045">45</a> And he shall plant the tabernacles of his <a href="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</a> between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.<br>
