 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 John Chapter 4</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Beloved, believe not every <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Hereby know ye the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of God: Every <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that confesseth that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is come in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is of God:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And every <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> that confesseth not that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> is come in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> is not of God: and this is that <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd025.htm#000">antichrist</a>, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of truth, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of error.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#009">propitiation</a> for our sins.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</a> of the world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Whosoever shall confess that <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath <a href="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</a>. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> We love him, because he first loved us.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.<br>
