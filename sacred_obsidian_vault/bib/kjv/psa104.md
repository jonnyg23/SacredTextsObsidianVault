 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 104</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a>: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Thou coveredst it with the <a href="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</a> as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a> they hasted away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> They give <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> to every <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> By them shall the fowls of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> have their <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a>, which sing among the branches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the <a href="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</a> of thy works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> He causeth the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> to grow for the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a> that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> which strengtheneth man's heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, which he hath planted;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Where the birds make their nests: as for the <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#007">stork</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</a> trees are her house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> He appointed the <a href="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</a> for <a href="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</a>: the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> knoweth his going down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Thou makest <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a> do creep forth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> The young <a href="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</a> roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a> ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> There go the <a href="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</a>: there is that <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#007">leviathan</a>, whom thou hast made to play therein.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Thou sendest forth thy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</a> thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.<br>
