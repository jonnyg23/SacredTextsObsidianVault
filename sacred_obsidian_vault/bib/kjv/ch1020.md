 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 20</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and came and besieged <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a>. But <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> tarried at <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> smote <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a>, and destroyed it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> took the <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> of their <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> from off his head, and found it to weigh a <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and with axes. Even so dealt <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> with all the cities of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and all the people returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at <a href="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</a> with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And there was war again with the <a href="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd115.htm#006">Elhanan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd196.htm#001">Jair</a> slew Lahmi the brother of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#005">Goliath</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</a>, whose spear staff was like a weaver's <a href="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And yet again there was war at <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But when he defied <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd338.htm#000">Shimea</a> David's brother slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> These were born unto the giant in <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</a>; and they fell by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and by the hand of his servants.<br>
