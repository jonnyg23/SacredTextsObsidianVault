 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 16</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> also with the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a> came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> A wicked and adulterous <a href="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</a> seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</a>. And he left them, and departed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> said unto them, Take heed and beware of the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Which when <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Neither the <a href="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</a> loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, that ye should beware of the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>, but of the doctrine of the <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</a> and of the <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> When <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> came into the coasts of <a href="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</a>, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</a>; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> answered and said, Thou art the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</a> Barjona: for <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And I say also unto thee, That thou art <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, and upon this <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a> I will build my church; and the gates of <a href="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</a> shall not prevail against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> From that time forth began <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</a>, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a> took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But he turned, and said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</a>, Get thee behind me, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a>: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Then said <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</a>, and follow me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> For the Son of man shall come in the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.<br>
