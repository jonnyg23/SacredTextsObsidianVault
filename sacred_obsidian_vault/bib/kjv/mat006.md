 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 6</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Take heed that ye do not your <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Therefore when thou doest thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a>, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But when thou doest <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a>, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> That thine <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</a> may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#000">closet</a>, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</a> do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, Hallowed be thy name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Give us this day our daily <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And lead us not into <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</a>, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, for ever. <a href="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Moreover when ye <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> But thou, when thou fastest, <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</a> thine head, and wash thy face;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> That thou appear not unto men to <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a> and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But lay up for yourselves treasures in <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, where neither <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</a> nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>. If therefore the light that is in thee be <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>, how great is that <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</a>!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and <a href="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Which of you by taking thought can add one <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#006">cubit</a> unto his stature?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And yet I say unto you, That even <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a> in all his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> was not arrayed like one of these.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Wherefore, if God so clothe the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</a> of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the <a href="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</a>, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> (For after all these things do the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>; and all these things shall be added unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.<br>
