 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 7</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the first year of <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> had a <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a> and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</a>, and told the sum of the matters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> spake and said, I saw in my <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a> by night, and, behold, the four <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> strove upon the great sea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And behold another <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> After this I beheld, and lo another, like a <a href="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</a>, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a> teeth: it devoured and brake in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a>, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</a>, and the hair of his head like the pure <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</a>: his <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a> ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> spake: I beheld even till the <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And there was given him dominion, and <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> I <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a> was grieved in my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Then I would know the truth of the fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and his nails of <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</a>; which devoured, brake in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>, and stamped the residue with his feet;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> I beheld, and the same <a href="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</a> made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> Thus he said, The fourth <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</a>, my <a href="../ebd/ebd086.htm#002">cogitations</a> much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.<br>
