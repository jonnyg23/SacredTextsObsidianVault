 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 31</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Woe to them that go down to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, neither seek the LORD!<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Yet he also is <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and not <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and for the hill thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Turn ye unto him from whom the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> have deeply revolted.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and his idols of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a>, which your own hands have made unto you for a <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Then shall the Assyrian fall with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, not of a mighty man; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and his young men shall be discomfited.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the <a href="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</a>, saith the LORD, whose fire is in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, and his <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
