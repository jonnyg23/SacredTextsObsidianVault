 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, and shall come into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and the idols of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall melt in the midst of it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> The fishers also shall <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Moreover they that work in fine <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a>, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for <a href="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Surely the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</a> are fools, the counsel of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> counsellors of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> is become brutish: how say ye unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, I am the son of the <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>, the son of ancient kings?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Where are they? where are thy <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a> men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> The princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</a> are become fools, the princes of <a href="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</a> are deceived; they have also seduced <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> The LORD hath mingled a perverse <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> in the midst thereof: and they have caused <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Neither shall there be any work for <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, which the head or tail, <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</a> or <a href="../ebd/ebd316.htm#007">rush</a>, may do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> In that day shall <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> shall be a terror unto <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> In that day shall five cities in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> speak the language of <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</a>, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> In that day shall there be an <a href="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</a> to the LORD in the midst of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and a <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</a> at the border thereof to the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And it shall be for a sign and for a <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto the LORD of hosts in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</a>, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD shall be known to <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</a> and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD shall smite <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> In that day shall there be a <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</a> out of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> to <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, and the Assyrian shall come into <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and the Egyptian into <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> In that day shall <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> be the third with <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> and with <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a>, even a blessing in the midst of the land:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whom the LORD of hosts shall <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</a>, saying, Blessed be <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> my people, and <a href="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</a> the work of my hands, and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> mine inheritance.<br>
