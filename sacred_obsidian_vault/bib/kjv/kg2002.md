 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 2</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> by a whirlwind, that <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> went with <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> from <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>. And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And the sons of the prophets that were at <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a> came forth to <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto him, <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the sons of the prophets that were at <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> came to <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> took his <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a>, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> be upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> went up by a whirlwind into <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the <a href="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and <a href="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</a> them in two <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> He took up also the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of <a href="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he took the <a href="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a>? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> went over.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a> saw him, they said, The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</a> doth rest on <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a>. And he said, Ye shall not send.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at <a href="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</a>,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And the men of the city said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a>, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And he said, Bring me a new <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</a>, and put <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a> therein. And they brought it to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a> in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</a> land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of <a href="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</a> which he spake.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And he went up from thence unto <a href="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</a>: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</a>, and tare forty and two children of them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he went from thence to <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</a>, and from thence he returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
