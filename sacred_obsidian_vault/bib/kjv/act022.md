 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> (And when they heard that he spake in the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</a> tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> I am verily a man which am a <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>, born in <a href="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</a>, a city in <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</a>, yet brought up in this city at the feet of <a href="../ebd/ebd142.htm#006">Gamaliel</a>, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> As also the high <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</a> doth bear me <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a>, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>, to bring them which were there bound unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, for to be punished.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And it came to pass, that, as I made my <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</a>, and was come nigh unto <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a> about noon, suddenly there shone from <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> a great light round about me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, why persecutest thou me?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</a>, whom thou persecutest.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And when I could not see for the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And one <a href="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</a>, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And he said, The God of our fathers hath <a href="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</a> thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For thou shalt be his <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</a> unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</a> on the name of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, even while I prayed in the <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</a>, I was in a <a href="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>: for they will not receive thy <a href="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</a> concerning me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</a> them that believed on thee:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And when the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a> of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd242.htm#008">martyr</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</a> was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> into the air,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the <a href="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</a>, and bade that he should be examined by <a href="../ebd/ebd324.htm#002">scourging</a>; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And as they bound him with thongs, <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said unto the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> When the <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</a> heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> said, But I was free born.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his <a href="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</a>, and commanded the chief priests and all their <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</a> to appear, and brought <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</a> down, and set him before them.<br>
