 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 25</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>. And his mother's name was <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#005">Jehoaddan</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> his father.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Moreover <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> gathered <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> together, and made them captains over <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</a>, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</a>: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> for an hundred talents of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> But there came a man of God to him, saying, O <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a>, let not the army of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> go with thee; for the LORD is not with <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, to wit, with all the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a>, to go home again: wherefore their <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was greatly kindled against <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and they returned home in great <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</a>, and smote of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a> ten thousand.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And other ten thousand left alive did the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> carry away <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</a>, and brought them unto the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, and cast them down from the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>, that they all were broken in <a href="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> But the soldiers of the army which <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, from <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a> even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Now it came to pass, after that <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</a>, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned <a href="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</a> unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Wherefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> of the LORD was kindled against <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a>, and he sent unto him a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a> forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> took advice, and sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, saying, The <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#004">thistle</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a> sent to the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> that was in <a href="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</a>, and trode down the <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#004">thistle</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> with thee?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> But <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> was put to the worse before <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and they fled every man to his <a href="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> took <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a>, the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a>, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and brake down the wall of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a> from the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</a> to the corner <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>, four hundred cubits.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And he took all the <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</a>, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> lived after the death of <a href="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</a> son of <a href="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> fifteen years.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a>, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Now after the time that <a href="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</a> did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>; and he fled to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a>: but they sent to <a href="../ebd/ebd222.htm#009">Lachish</a> after him, and slew him there.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
