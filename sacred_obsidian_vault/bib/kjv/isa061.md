 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 61</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</a> of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</a> to them that are bound;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> To appoint unto them that <a href="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</a> in <a href="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</a>, to give unto them beauty for <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a>, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> of heaviness; that they might be called trees of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the <a href="../ebd/ebd017.htm#003">alien</a> shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and in their <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shall ye boast yourselves.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> joy shall be unto them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For I the LORD love judgment, I hate <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</a> for burnt <a href="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</a>; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an <a href="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a> with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And their seed shall be known among the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of <a href="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</a>, he hath covered me with the robe of <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a <a href="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</a> adorneth herself with her jewels.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> and praise to spring forth before all the nations.<br>
