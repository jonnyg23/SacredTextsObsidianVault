 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 22</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> The <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, nor dead in battle.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</a>, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd114.htm#003">Elam</a> bare the <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#000">quiver</a> with chariots of men and horsemen, and <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#007">Kir</a> uncovered the <a href="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the <a href="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And he discovered the covering of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>, and thou didst look in that day to the <a href="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</a> of the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And ye have numbered the houses of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to <a href="../ebd/ebd042.htm#008">baldness</a>, and to girding with <a href="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>, <a href="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, and drinking <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</a>: let us eat and <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a>; for to morrow we shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto <a href="../ebd/ebd332.htm#009">Shebna</a>, which is over the house, and say,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> here, as he that heweth him out a <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a> on high, and that graveth an <a href="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</a> for himself in a <a href="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty <a href="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</a>, and will surely cover thee.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> shall be the shame of thy lord's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant <a href="../ebd/ebd116.htm#000">Eliakim</a> the son of <a href="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy <a href="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</a>, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>, and to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</a> of the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And I will fasten him as a <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#000">nail</a> in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</a> to his father's house.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And they shall hang upon him all the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the <a href="../ebd/ebd266.htm#000">nail</a> that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.<br>
