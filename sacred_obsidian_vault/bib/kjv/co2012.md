 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> It is not expedient for me doubtless to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> I knew a man in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> How that he was caught up into <a href="../ebd/ebd284.htm#004">paradise</a>, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Of such an one will I <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>: yet of myself I will not <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, but in mine infirmities.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> For though I would desire to <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a <a href="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</a> in the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>, the <a href="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</a> to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And he said unto me, My <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> in my infirmities, that the power of <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> may rest upon me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Truly the signs of an <a href="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</a> were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> But be it so, I did not <a href="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</a> you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> I desired <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a>, and with him I sent a brother. Did <a href="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</a> make a gain of you? walked we not in the same <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a>? walked we not in the same steps?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a>: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and <a href="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</a> and lasciviousness which they have committed.<br>
