 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 9</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Then the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Go in unto <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</a>: there shall be a very grievous <a href="../ebd/ebd262.htm#004">murrain</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And the LORD shall sever between the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> died: but of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> died not one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> sent, and, behold, there was not one of the <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> of the Israelites dead. And the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> was hardened, and he did not let the people go.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and unto <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, Take to you handfuls of <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>, and let <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> sprinkle it toward the <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a> in the sight of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And it shall become small <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a> in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, and shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a> breaking forth with <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#004">blains</a> upon man, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And they took <a href="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</a> of the <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>, and stood before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> sprinkled it up toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>; and it became a <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a> breaking forth with <a href="../ebd/ebd060.htm#004">blains</a> upon man, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a> could not stand before <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> because of the boils; for the <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</a> was upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</a>, and upon all the Egyptians.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And the LORD hardened the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the <a href="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</a>, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> a very grievous <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, such as hath not been in <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> since the foundation thereof even until now.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Send therefore now, and gather thy <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a>, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> shall come down upon them, and they shall die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> made his servants and his <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> flee into the houses:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his <a href="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</a> in the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Stretch forth thine hand toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>, that there may be <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, upon man, and upon <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>, and upon every <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> of the field, throughout the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> stretched forth his rod toward <a href="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</a>: and the LORD sent <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> upon the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> So there was <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, and fire mingled with the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> since it became a nation.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> smote throughout all the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a> all that was in the field, both man and <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a>; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> smote every <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</a> of the field, and brake every tree of the field.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> Only in the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</a>, where the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were, was there no <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> sent, and called for <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a>, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the <a href="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</a> shall cease, neither shall there be any more <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a>; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> was smitten: for the <a href="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</a> was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</a>, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</a> was <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#009">bolled</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</a> and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> went out of the city from <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a>, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> ceased, and the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> was not poured upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> And when <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> saw that the <a href="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</a> and the <a href="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</a> and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="035">35</a> And the heart of <a href="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</a> was hardened, neither would he let the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> go; as the LORD had spoken by <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>.<br>
