 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 3</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> What advantage then hath the <a href="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</a>? or what profit is there of <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a>?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> But if our unrighteousness commend the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> God forbid: for then how shall God <a href="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</a> the world?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a>; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose <a href="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</a> is just.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> What then? are we better than they? No, in no <a href="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</a>: for we have before proved both Jews and <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>, that they are all under <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Their throat is an open <a href="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</a>; with their tongues they have used deceit; the <a href="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</a> of asps is under their lips:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Their feet are swift to shed <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">Destruction</a> and misery are in their ways:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the way of peace have they not known:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> There is no fear of God before their eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a> be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> But now the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Even the <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> of God which is by faith of <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> For all have sinned, and come short of the <a href="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</a> of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> Being justified freely by his <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</a> through the <a href="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</a> that is in <a href="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> Whom God hath set forth to be a <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#009">propitiation</a> through faith in his <a href="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</a>, to declare his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a> for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> To declare, I say, at this time his <a href="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</a>: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in <a href="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a>? Yes, of the <a href="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</a> also:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the <a href="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</a> by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<br>
