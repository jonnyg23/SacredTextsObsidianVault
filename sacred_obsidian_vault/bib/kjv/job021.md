 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 21</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> But Job answered and said,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my <a href="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</a> be troubled?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my <a href="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their <a href="../ebd/ebd092.htm#001">cow</a> calveth, and casteth not her <a href="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children <a href="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> They take the <a href="../ebd/ebd366.htm#004">timbrel</a> and <a href="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</a>, and rejoice at the sound of the <a href="../ebd/ebd280.htm#004">organ</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> How oft is the <a href="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</a> of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a> upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> They are as stubble before the wind, and as <a href="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</a> that the storm carrieth away.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> His eyes shall see his <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>, and he shall <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</a> of the wrath of the Almighty.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> His breasts are full of <a href="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</a>, and his bones are moistened with marrow.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> They shall lie down alike in the <a href="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</a>, and the worms shall cover them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> For ye say, Where is the house of the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</a>? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> That the wicked is reserved to the day of <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</a>? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="032">32</a> Yet shall he be brought to the <a href="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</a>, and shall remain in the tomb.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="033">33</a> The clods of the <a href="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</a> shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="034">34</a> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?<br>
