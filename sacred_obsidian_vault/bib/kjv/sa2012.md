 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 12</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> And the LORD sent <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> But the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man had nothing, save one little ewe <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a>, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own <a href="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</a>, and lay in his <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and was unto him as a daughter.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own <a href="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</a>, to <a href="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</a> for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the <a href="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</a> man's <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a>, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> And David's <a href="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</a> was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a>, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And he shall restore the <a href="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</a> fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> said to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, I anointed thee <a href="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</a> over <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and I delivered thee out of the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy <a href="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</a>, and gave thee the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> and of <a href="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</a>; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</a> the Hittite with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a>, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Now therefore the <a href="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</a> shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of <a href="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</a> the Hittite to be thy wife.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>, and before the <a href="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a>, I have sinned against the LORD. And <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, The LORD also hath put away thy <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</a>; thou shalt not die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and it was very sick.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> therefore besought God for the child; and <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> with them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> But when <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> saw that his servants whispered, <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> perceived that the child was dead: therefore <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> Then <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his <a href="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</a>, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a> before him, and he did eat.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a> and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat <a href="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> But now he is dead, wherefore should I <a href="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</a>? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</a>: and the LORD loved him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> And he sent by the hand of <a href="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</a> the <a href="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</a>; and he called his name <a href="../ebd/ebd199.htm#008">Jedidiah</a>, because of the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="026">26</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a> of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>, and took the royal city.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="027">27</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</a> sent messengers to <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a>, and said, I have fought against <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a>, and have taken the city of waters.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="028">28</a> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and <a href="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</a> against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="029">29</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> gathered all the people together, and went to <a href="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</a>, and fought against it, and took it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="030">30</a> And he took their king's <a href="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</a> from off his head, the weight whereof was a <a href="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</a> with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="031">31</a> And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and under axes of <a href="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</a>, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</a>. So <a href="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</a> and all the people returned unto <a href="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</a>.<br>
