 <h3 align="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 19</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> In the third month, when the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> were gone forth out of the land of <a href="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</a>, the same day came they into the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> For they were departed from <a href="../ebd/ebd311.htm#002">Rephidim</a>, and were come to the <a href="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</a> of <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, and had pitched in the <a href="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</a>; and there <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a> camped before the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of <a href="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</a>, and tell the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>;<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my <a href="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</a>, then ye shall be a <a href="../ebd/ebd287.htm#008">peculiar</a> treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of <a href="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> returned the words of the people unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a>, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> told the words of the people unto the LORD.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> shall be surely put to death:<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be <a href="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</a> or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> went down from the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick <a href="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</a> upon the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> trembled.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> brought forth the people out of the <a href="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</a> to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a> was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a <a href="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</a>, and the whole <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> quaked greatly.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> spake, and God answered him by a voice.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="020">20</a> And the LORD came down upon <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>, on the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>: and the LORD called <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> up to the top of the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>; and <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> went up.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="021">21</a> And the LORD said unto <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a>, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="022">22</a> And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="023">23</a> And <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a> <a href="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</a>: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</a>, and sanctify it.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="024">24</a> And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and <a href="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</a> with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.<br>
 </p>
 <p><a name="025">25</a> So <a href="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</a> went down unto the people, and spake unto them.<br>
