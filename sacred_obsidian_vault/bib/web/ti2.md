  <h3 align="center">World English Bible: 2 Timothy</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> This saying is faithful: "For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He can't deny himself."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Be diligent to come to me soon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
