  <h3 align="center">World English Bible: Proverbs</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles of the wise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> My son, listen to your father's instruction, and don't forsake your mother's teaching:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> If they say, "Come with us, Let's lay in wait for blood; let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> We'll find all valuable wealth. We'll fill our houses with spoil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> You shall cast your lot among us. We'll all have one purse."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> My son, don't walk in the way with them. Keep your foot from their path,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> but these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come on you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> Then will they call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> because they hated knowledge, and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my commandments within you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his saints.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> None who go to her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> My son, don't forget my teaching; but let your heart keep my commandments:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Don't let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don't lean on your own understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Don't be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits of all your increase:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, neither be weary of his reproof:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her return is better than fine gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won't stumble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Don't be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> Don't say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again; tomorrow I will give it to you," when you have it by you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> Don't devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells securely by you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> Don't strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> Don't envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship is with the upright.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:33">3:33</a> Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:34">3:34</a> Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:35">3:35</a> The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion of fools.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Listen, sons, to a father's instruction. Pay attention and know understanding;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> for I give you sound learning. Don't forsake my law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> He taught me, and said to me: "Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don't forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Take firm hold of instruction. Don't let her go. Keep her, for she is your life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Don't enter into the path of the wicked. Don't walk in the way of evil men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> Avoid it, and don't pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> For they don't sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light, that shines more and more until the perfect day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don't know what they stumble over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the midst of your heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the wellspring of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn't know it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don't depart from the words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Remove your way far from her. Don't come near the door of her house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of the gathered assembly."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> A loving doe and a graceful deer-- let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh. He examines all his paths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> My son, keep your father's commandment, and don't forsake your mother's teaching.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> Men don't despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:31">6:31</a> but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:32">6:32</a> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:33">6:33</a> He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:34">6:34</a> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won't spare in the day of vengeance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:35">6:35</a> He won't regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Keep my commandments and live! Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> Tell wisdom, "You are my sister." Call understanding your relative,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> passing through the street near her corner, he went the way to her house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, and with crafty intent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> She is loud and defiant. Her feet don't stay in her house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking at every corner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> "Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. This day I have paid my vows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face, and I have found you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning. Let's solace ourselves with loving.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> For my husband isn't at home. He has gone on a long journey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, as a fool stepping into a noose.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries to the snare, and doesn't know that it will cost his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> Don't let your heart turn to her ways. Don't go astray in her paths,</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> Doesn't wisdom cry out? Doesn't understanding raise her voice?</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> then I was the craftsman by his side. I was a delight day by day, always rejoicing before him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> Rejoicing in his whole world. My delight was with the sons of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> the ants are not a strong people, yet they provide their food in the summer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> The locusts have no king, yet they advance in ranks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:28">30:28</a> You can catch a lizard with your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> "There are three things which are stately in their march, four which are stately in going:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> The lion, which is mightiest among animals, and doesn't turn away for any;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> the greyhound, the male goat also; and the king against whom there is no rising up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:32">30:32</a> "If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have thought evil, put your hand over your mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:33">30:33</a> For as the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> "Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of my vows!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Don't give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, 'Where is strong drink?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine to the bitter in soul:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are left desolate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to the poor and needy."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Who can find a worthy woman? For her price is far above rubies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> The heart of her husband trusts in her. He shall have no lack of gain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> She is like the merchant ships. She brings her bread from afar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household, and portions for her servant girls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> She considers a field, and buys it. With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> She arms her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp doesn't go out by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands to the needy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes to the merchant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> Strength and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> She opens her mouth with wisdom. Faithful instruction is on her tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn't eat the bread of idleness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> Her children rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> "Many women do noble things, but you excel them all."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> Give her of the fruit of her hands! Let her works praise her in the gates!</p>
