  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: Titus</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> For the bishop must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> [to be] sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine [showing] uncorruptness, gravity,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> [Exhort] servants to be in subjection to their own masters, [and] to be well-pleasing [to them] in all things; not gainsaying;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> not by works [done] in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all. </p>
