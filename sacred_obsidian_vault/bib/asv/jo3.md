  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: 3 John</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth [them] out of the church.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Demetrius hath the witness of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write [them] to thee with ink and pen:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Peace [be] unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. </p>
