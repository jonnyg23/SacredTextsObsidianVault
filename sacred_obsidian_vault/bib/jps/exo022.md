 <p><a name="an_exo:22:1">1</a> <span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. <a name="an_exo:22:2">2</a> If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him—he shall make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. <a name="an_exo:22:3">3</a> If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:4">4</a> If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:5">5</a> If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:6">6</a> If a man deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double. <a name="an_exo:22:7">7</a> If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto  <a name="fr_86"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 God, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods. <a name="an_exo:22:8">8</a> For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith: 'This is it,' the cause of both parties shall come before  <a name="fr_87"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">a</font></a>God; he whom  <a name="fr_88"></a><a href="#fn_85"><font size="1">a</font></a>God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:9">9</a> If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it; <a name="an_exo:22:10">10</a> the oath of the LORD shall be between them both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. <a name="an_exo:22:11">11</a> But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. <a name="an_exo:22:12">12</a> If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:13">13</a> And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution. <a name="an_exo:22:14">14</a>If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hireling, he loseth his hire.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:15">15</a> And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. <a name="an_exo:22:16">16</a> If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:17">17</a> Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:18">18</a> Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:19">19</a> He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:20">20</a> And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. <a name="an_exo:22:21">21</a> Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. <a name="an_exo:22:22">22</a> If thou afflict them in any wise—for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry—<a name="an_exo:22:23">23</a> My wrath shall wax <a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></a> hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:24">24</a> If thou lend money to any of My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest. <a name="an_exo:22:25">25</a> If thou at all take thy neighbour's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down; <a name="an_exo:22:26">26</a> for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:22:27">27</a> Thou shalt not revile  <a name="fr_89"></a><a href="#fn_86"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 God, nor curse a ruler of thy people. <a name="an_exo:22:28">28</a> Thou shalt not delay to offer of the fulness of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me. <a name="an_exo:22:29">29</a> Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me. <a name="an_exo:22:30">30</a> And ye shall be holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
