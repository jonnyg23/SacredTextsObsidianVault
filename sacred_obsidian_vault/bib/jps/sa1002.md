 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:1">1</a> And Hannah prayed, and said:<br> My heart exulteth in the LORD,<br> My horn is exalted in the LORD;<br> My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;<br> Because I rejoice in Thy salvation.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:2">2</a> There is none holy as the LORD;<br> For there is none beside Thee;<br> Neither is there any rock like our God.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:3">3</a> Multiply not exceeding proud talk;<br> Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth;<br> For the LORD is a God of knowledge,<br> And by Him actions are weighed.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:4">4</a> The bows of the mighty men are broken,<br> And they that stumbled are girded with strength.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:5">5</a> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;<br> And they that were hungry have ceased;<br> While the barren hath borne seven,<br> She that had many children hath languished.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:6">6</a> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive;<br> He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:7">7</a> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich;<br> He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:8">8</a> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,<br> He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill,<br> To make them sit with princes,<br> And inherit the throne of glory;<br> For the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S,<br> And He hath set the world upon them.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:9">9</a> He will keep the feet of His holy ones,<br> But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;<br> For not by strength shall man prevail.<br> <a name="an_sa1:2:10">10</a> They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces;<br> Against them will He thunder in heaven; <a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="green">p. 327</font></a><br> The LORD will judge the ends of the earth;<br> And He will give strength unto His king,<br> And exalt the horn of His anointed.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:11">11</a> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:12">12</a> Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD. <a name="an_sa1:3:13">13</a> And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand; <a name="an_sa1:2:14">14</a> and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh. <a name="an_sa1:2:15">15</a> Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: `Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.' <a name="an_sa1:2:16">16</a> And if the man said unto him: `Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: `Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.' <a name="an_sa1:2:17">17</a> And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:18">18</a> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. <a name="an_sa1:2:19">19</a> Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <a name="an_sa1:2:20">20</a> And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: `The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.' And they would go unto their own home. <a name="an_sa1:2:21">21</a> So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:22">22</a> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting. <a name="an_sa1:2:23">23</a> And he said unto them: `Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people. <a name="an_sa1:2:24">24</a> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the LORD's people do spread abroad. <a name="an_sa1:2:25">25</a> If one man sin against another; God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. <a name="an_sa1:2:26">26</a> And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_sa1:2:27">27</a> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: `Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house? <a name="an_sa1:2:28">28</a> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? <a name="an_sa1:2:29">29</a> Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people? <a name="an_sa1:2:30">30</a> Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="green">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p>for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. <a name="an_sa1:2:31">31</a> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house. <a name="an_sa1:2:32">32</a> And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. <a name="an_sa1:2:33">33</a> Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men. <a name="an_sa1:2:34">34</a> And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them. <a name="an_sa1:2:35">35</a> And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever. <a name="an_sa1:2:36">36</a> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: <a href="errata.htm#5">`</a> Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'</p>
