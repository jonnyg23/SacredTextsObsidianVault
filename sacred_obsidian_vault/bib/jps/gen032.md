 <p><a name="an_gen:32:1">1</a> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto his place. <a name="an_gen:32:2">2</a> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <a name="an_gen:32:3">3</a> And Jacob said when he saw them: 'This is God's camp.' And he called the name of that place  <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">d</font></a>
 Mahanaim.</p>

 <p><a name="an_gen:32:4">4</a> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. <a name="an_gen:32:5">5</a> And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now. <a name="an_gen:32:6">6</a> And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.' <a name="an_gen:32:7">7</a> And the messengers <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a> returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.' <a name="an_gen:32:8">8</a> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps. <a name="an_gen:32:9">9</a> And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.' <a name="an_gen:32:10">10</a> And Jacob said: 'O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good; <a name="an_gen:32:11">11</a> I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps. <a name="an_gen:32:12">12</a> Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. <a name="an_gen:32:13">13</a> And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.' <a name="an_gen:32:14">14</a> And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: <a name="an_gen:32:15">15</a> two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <a name="an_gen:32:16">16</a> thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. <a name="an_gen:32:17">17</a> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.' <a name="an_gen:32:18">18</a> And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? <a name="an_gen:32:19">19</a> then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.' <a name="an_gen:32:20">20</a> And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; <a name="an_gen:32:21">21</a> and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.' For he said: 'I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.' <a name="an_gen:32:22">22</a> So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:32:23">23</a> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. <a name="an_gen:32:24">24</a> And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. <a name="an_gen:32:25">25</a> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. <a name="an_gen:32:26">26</a> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. <a name="an_gen:32:27">27</a> And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.' <a name="an_gen:32:28">28</a> And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.' <a name="an_gen:32:29">29</a> And he said: Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but  <a name="fr_53"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.' <a name="an_gen:32:30">30</a> And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. <a name="an_gen:32:31">31</a> And Jacob called the name of the place  <a name="fr_54"></a><a href="#fn_53"><font size="1">b</font></a>
 Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.' <a name="an_gen:32:32">32</a> And the <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a> sun rose upon him as he passed over  <a name="fr_55"></a><a href="#fn_54"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh. <a name="an_gen:32:33">33</a> Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.</p>
