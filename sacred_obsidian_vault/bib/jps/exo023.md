 <p><a name="an_exo:23:1">1</a> Thou shalt not utter a false report; put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. <a name="an_exo:23:2">2</a> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert justice; <a name="an_exo:23:3">3</a> neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:4">4</a> If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:5">5</a> If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its burden, thou shalt forbear to pass by him; thou shalt surely release it with him.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:6">6</a> Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. <a name="an_exo:23:7">7</a> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked. <a name="an_exo:23:8">8</a> And thou shalt take no gift; for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. <a name="an_exo:23:9">9</a> And a stranger shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:10">10</a> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in the increase thereof; <a name="an_exo:23:11">11</a> but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. <a name="an_exo:23:12">12</a> Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. <a name="an_exo:23:13">13</a> And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed; and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:14">14</a> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year. <a name="an_exo:23:15">15</a> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib—for in it thou earnest out from Egypt; and none shall appear before Me empty; <a name="an_exo:23:16">16</a> and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field; and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field. <a name="an_exo:23:17">17</a> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:18">18</a> Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of My feast remain <a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></a> all night until the morning. <a name="an_exo:23:19">19</a> The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:23:20">20</a> Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. <a name="an_exo:23:21">21</a> Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; be not rebellious against him; for he will not pardon your transgression; for My name is in him. <a name="an_exo:23:22">22</a> But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. <a name="an_exo:23:23">23</a> For Mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off. <a name="an_exo:23:24">24</a> Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their doings; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. <a name="an_exo:23:25">25</a> And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. <a name="an_exo:23:26">26</a> None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil. <a name="an_exo:23:27">27</a> I will send My terror be fore thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. <a name="an_exo:23:28">28</a> And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. <a name="an_exo:23:29">29</a> I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. <a name="an_exo:23:30">30</a> By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. <a name="an_exo:23:31">31</a> And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto  <a name="fr_90"></a><a href="#fn_87"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. <a name="an_exo:23:32">32</a> Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. <a name="an_exo:23:33">33</a> They shall not dwell in thy land—lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve their gods—for they will be a snare unto thee.</p>
