 <p><a name="an_num:30:1">1</a> And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p>  
 <p align="center">‏מטו.ט‎</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:30:2">2</a> And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded. <a name="an_num:30:3">3</a> When a man voweth a vow unto the LORD, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. <a name="an_num:30:4">4</a> Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the LORD, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth, <a name="an_num:30:5">5</a> and her father heareth her vow, or her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. <a name="an_num:30:6">6</a> But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her, because her father disallowed her. <a name="an_num:30:7">7</a> And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; <a name="an_num:30:8">8</a> and her husband hear it, whatsoever day it be that he heareth it, and hold his peace at her; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. <a name="an_num:30:9">9</a> But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; and the LORD will forgive her. <a name="an_num:30:10">10</a> But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even every thing wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her. <a name="an_num:30:11">11</a> And if a woman vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, <a name="an_num:30:12">12</a> and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. <a name="an_num:30:13">13</a> But if her husband make them null and void in the day that he heareth them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips, whether it were her vows, or the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD will forgive her. <a name="an_num:30:14">14</a> Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void. <a name="an_num:30:15">15</a> But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he causeth all her vows to stand, or all her bonds, which are upon her; he hath let them stand, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. <a name="an_num:30:16">16</a> But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity. <a name="an_num:30:17">17</a> These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.</p>
