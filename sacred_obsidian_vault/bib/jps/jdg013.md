 <p><a name="an_jdg:13:1">1</a> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:13:2">2</a> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not. <a name="an_jdg:13:3">3</a> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: `Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. <a name="an_jdg:13:4">4</a> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. <a name="an_jdg:13:5">5</a> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.' <a name="an_jdg:13:6">6</a> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying: `A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name; <a name="an_jdg:13:7">7</a> but he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God</p>

 <p>from the womb to the day of his death.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:13:8">8</a> Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said: `Oh, Lord, I pray Thee, let the man of God whom Thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.' <a name="an_jdg:13:9">9</a> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her. <a name="an_jdg:13:10">10</a> And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him: `Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me that day.' <a name="an_jdg:13:11">11</a> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him: `Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman?' And he said: `I am.' <a name="an_jdg:13:12">12</a> And Manoah said: `Now when thy word cometh to pass, what shall be the rule for the child, and what shall be done with him?' <a name="an_jdg:13:13">13</a> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah: `Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. <a name="an_jdg:13:14">14</a> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the grape-vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.' <a name="an_jdg:13:15">15</a> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD: `I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.' <a name="an_jdg:13:16">16</a> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah: `Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD.' For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the LORD. <a name="an_jdg:13:17">17</a> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD: `What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?' <a name="an_jdg:13:18">18</a> And the angel of the LORD said unto him: `Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is hidden?' <a name="an_jdg:13:19">19</a> So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the LORD; and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. <a name="an_jdg:13:20">20</a> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. <a name="an_jdg:13:21">21</a> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD. <a name="an_jdg:13:22">22</a> And Manoah said unto his wife: `We shall surely die, because we have seen God.' <a name="an_jdg:13:23">23</a> But his wife said unto him: `If the LORD were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would He have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:13:24">24</a> And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. <a name="an_jdg:13:25">25</a> And the spirit of the LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p>
