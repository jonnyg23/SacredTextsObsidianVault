 <p><a name="an_gen:42:1">1</a> Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons: 'Why do ye look one upon another?' <a name="an_gen:42:2">2</a> And he said: 'Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.' <a name="an_gen:42:3">3</a> And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. <a name="an_gen:42:4">4</a> But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said: 'Lest peradventure harm befall him.' <a name="an_gen:42:5">5</a> And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. <a name="an_gen:42:6">6</a> And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth. <a name="an_gen:42:7">7</a> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said unto them: 'Whence come ye?' And they said: 'From the land of Canaan to buy food.' <a name="an_gen:42:8">8</a> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. <a name="an_gen:42:9">9</a> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them: 'Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.' <a name="an_gen:42:10">10</a> And they said unto him: 'Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. <a name="an_gen:42:11">11</a> We are all one man's sons; we are upright men, thy servants are no spies.' <a name="an_gen:42:12">12</a> And he said unto them: 'Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.' <a name="an_gen:42:13">13</a> And they said: 'We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.' <a name="an_gen:42:14">14</a> And Joseph said unto them: 'That is it that I spoke unto you, saying: Ye are spies. <a name="an_gen:42:15">15</a> Hereby ye shall be proved: as Pharaoh liveth, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. <a name="an_gen:42:16">16</a> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a> shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you; or else, as Pharaoh liveth, surely ye are spies.' <a name="an_gen:42:17">17</a> And he put them all together into ward three days. <a name="an_gen:42:18">18</a> And Joseph said unto them the third day: 'This do, and live; for I fear God: <a name="an_gen:42:19">19</a> if ye be upright men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses; <a name="an_gen:42:20">20</a> and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.' And they did so. <a name="an_gen:42:21">21</a> And they said one to another: 'We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.' <a name="an_gen:42:22">22</a> And Reuben answered them, saying: 'Spoke I not unto you, saying: Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.' <a name="an_gen:42:23">23</a> And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for the interpreter was between them. <a name="an_gen:42:24">24</a> And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. <a name="an_gen:42:25">25</a> Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus was it done unto them. <a name="an_gen:42:26">26</a> And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence. <a name="an_gen:42:27">27</a> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. <a name="an_gen:42:28">28</a> And he said unto his brethren: 'My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack.' And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying: 'What is this that God hath done unto us?' <a name="an_gen:42:29">29</a> And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying: <a name="an_gen:42:30">30</a> 'The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. <a name="an_gen:42:31">31</a> And we said unto him: We are upright men; we are no spies. <a name="an_gen:42:32">32</a> We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. <a name="an_gen:42:33">33</a> And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us: Hereby shall I know that ye are upright men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your way. <a name="an_gen:42:34">34</a> And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.' <a name="an_gen:42:35">35</a> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <a name="an_gen:42:36">36</a> And Jacob their father said unto them: 'Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; upon me are all these things come.' <a name="an_gen:42:37">37</a> And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying: 'Thou shalt slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.' <a name="an_gen:42:38">38</a> And he said: 'My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.'</p>
