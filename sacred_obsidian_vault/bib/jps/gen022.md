 <p><a name="an_gen:22:1">1</a> And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him: 'Abraham'; and he said: 'Here am I.' <a name="an_gen:22:2">2</a> And He said: 'Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.' <a name="an_gen:22:3">3</a> And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. <a name="an_gen:22:4">4</a> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. <a name="an_gen:22:5">5</a> And Abraham said unto his young men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.' <a name="an_gen:22:6">6</a> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. <a name="an_gen:22:7">7</a> And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: 'My father.' And he said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said: 'Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?' <a name="an_gen:22:8">8</a> And Abraham said: 'God will  <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.' So they went both of them together. <a name="an_gen:22:9">9</a> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. <a name="an_gen:22:10">10</a> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. <a name="an_gen:22:11">11</a> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said: 'Abraham, Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.' <a name="an_gen:22:12">12</a> And he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' <a name="an_gen:22:13">13</a> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. <a name="an_gen:22:14">14</a> And Abraham called the name of that place  <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">b</font></a>
 Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: 'In the mount where the LORD is seen.' <a name="an_gen:22:15">15</a> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, <a name="an_gen:22:16">16</a> and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, <a name="an_gen:22:17">17</a> that in blessing I will bless thee, and <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a> in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; <a name="an_gen:22:18">18</a> and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.' <a name="an_gen:22:19">19</a> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:22:20">20</a> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor: <a name="an_gen:22:21">21</a> Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; <a name="an_gen:22:22">22</a> and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.' <a name="an_gen:22:23">23</a> And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. <a name="an_gen:22:24">24</a> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tehah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.</p>
