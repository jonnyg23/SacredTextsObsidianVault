 <p align="center">‏האזינו‎</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:1">1</a> Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;<br> And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:2">2</a> My doctrine shall drop as the rain,<br> My speech shall distil as the dew;<br> As the small rain upon the tender grass,<br> And as the showers upon the herb.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:3">3</a> For I will proclaim the name of the LORD;<br> Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:4">4</a> The Rock, His work is perfect;<br> For all His ways are justice;<br> A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,<br> Just and right is He.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:5">5</a> Is corruption His? No; His children's is the blemish;<br> A generation crooked and perverse.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:6">6</a> Do ye thus requite the LORD,<br> O foolish people and unwise?<br> Is not, He thy father that hath gotten thee?<br> Hath He not made thee, and established thee?</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:7">7</a> Remember the days of old,<br> Consider the years of many generations;<br> Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee,<br> Thine elders, and they will tell thee.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:8">8</a> When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,<br> When He separated the children of men,<br> He set the borders of the peoples<br> According to the number of the children of Israel.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:9">9</a> For the portion of the LORD is His people,<br> Jacob the lot of His inheritance.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:10">10</a> He found him in a desert land,<br> And in the waste, a howling wilderness;<br> He compassed him about, He cared for him,<br> He kept him as the apple of His eye.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:11">11</a> As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,<br> Hovereth over her young,<br> Spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,<br> Beareth them on her pinions—<br> <a name="an_deu:32:12">12</a> The LORD alone did lead him,<br> And there was no strange god with Him.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:13">13</a> He made him ride on the high places of the earth,<br> And he did eat the fruitage of the field;<br> And He made him to suck honey out of the crag,<br> And oil out of the flinty rock;<br> <a name="an_deu:32:14">14</a> Curd of kine, and milk of sheep,<br> With fat of lambs, <a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></a><br> And rams of the breed of Bashan, and he-goats,<br> With the kidney-fat of wheat;<br> And of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:15">15</a> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked—<br> Thou didst wax fat, thou didst grow thick, thou didst become gross—<br> And he forsook God who made him,<br> And contemned the Rock of his salvation.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:16">16</a> They roused Him to jealousy with strange gods,<br> With abominations did they provoke Him.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:17">17</a> They sacrificed unto demons, no-gods,<br> Gods that they knew not,<br> New gods that came up of late,<br> Which your fathers dreaded not.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:18">18</a> Of the Rock that begot thee thou wast unmindful,<br> And didst forget God that bore thee.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:19">19</a> And the LORD saw, and spurned,<br> Because of the provoking of His sons and His daughters.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:20">20</a> And He said: `I will hide My face from them,<br> I will see what their end shall be;<br> For they are a very froward generation,<br> Children in whom is no faithfulness.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:21">21</a> They have roused Me to jealousy with a no-god;<br> They have provoked Me with their vanities;<br> And I will rouse them to jealousy with a no-people;<br> I will provoke them with a vile nation.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:22">22</a> For a fire is kindled in My nostril,<br> And burneth unto the depths of the nether-world,<br> And devoureth the earth with her produce,<br> And setteth ablaze the foundations of the mountains.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:23">23</a> I will heap evils upon them;<br> I will spend Mine arrows upon them;<br> <a name="an_deu:32:24">24</a> The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the fiery bolt,<br> And bitter destruction;<br> And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,<br> With the venom of crawling things of the dust.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:25">25</a> Without shall the sword bereave,<br> And in the chambers terror;<br> Slaying both young man and virgin,<br> The suckling with the man of gray hairs.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:26">26</a> I thought I would make an end of them,<br> I would make their memory cease from among men;<br> <a name="an_deu:32:27">27</a> Were it not that I dreaded the enemy's provocation,<br> Lest their adversaries should misdeem,<br> Lest they should say: Our hand is exalted,<br> And not the LORD hath wrought all this.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:28">28</a> For they are a nation void of counsel,<br> And there is no understanding in them.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:29">29</a> If they were wise, they would understand this,<br> They would discern their latter end.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:30">30</a> How should one chase a thousand,<br> And two put ten thousand to flight,<br> Except their Rock had given them over,<br> And the LORD had delivered them up?<br> <a name="an_deu:32:31">31</a> For their rock is not as our Rock, <a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>Even our enemies themselves being judges.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:32">32</a> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,<br> And of the fields of Gomorrah;<br> Their grapes are grapes of gall,<br> Their clusters are bitter;<br> <a name="an_deu:32:33">33</a> Their wine is the venom of serpents,<br> And the cruel poison of asps.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:34">34</a> `Is not this laid up in store with Me,<br> Sealed up in My treasuries?<br> <a name="an_deu:32:35">35</a> Vengeance is Mine, and recompense,<br> Against the time when their foot shall slip;<br> For the day of their calamity is at hand,<br> And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:36">36</a> For the LORD will judge His people,<br> And repent Himself for His servants;<br> When He seeth that their stay is gone,<br> And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:37">37</a> And it is said: Where are their gods,<br> The rock in whom they trusted;<br> <a name="an_deu:32:38">38</a> Who did eat the fat of their sacrifices,<br> And drank the wine of their drink-offering?<br> Let him rise up and help you,<br> Let him be your protection.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:39">39</a> See now that I, even I, am He,<br> And there is no god with Me;<br> I kill, and I make alive;<br> I have wounded, and I heal;<br> And there is none that can deliver out of My hand.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:40">40</a> For I lift up My hand to heaven,<br> And say: As I live for ever,<br> <a name="an_deu:32:41">41</a> If I whet My glittering sword,<br> And My hand take hold on judgment;<br> I will render vengeance to Mine adversaries,<br> And will recompense them that hate Me.<br> <a name="an_deu:32:42">42</a> I will make Mine arrows drunk with blood,<br> And My sword shall devour flesh;<br> With the blood of the slain and the captives,<br> From the long-haired heads of the enemy.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:43">43</a> Sing aloud, O ye nations, of His people;<br> For He doth avenge the blood of His servants,<br> And doth render vengeance to His adversaries,<br> And doth make expiation for the land of His people.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:44">44</a> And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. <a name="an_deu:32:45">45</a> And when Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel, <a name="an_deu:32:46">46</a> he said unto them: `Set your heart unto all the words wherewith I testify against you this day; that ye may charge your children therewith to observe to do all the words of this law. <a name="an_deu:32:47">47</a> For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:32:48">48</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses that selfsame day, saying: <a name="an_deu:32:49">49</a> `Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; <a name="an_deu:32:50">50</a> and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people. <a name="an_deu:32:51">51</a> Because ye</p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel. <a name="an_deu:32:52">52</a> For thou shalt see the land afar off; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.'</p>
