 <p><a name="an_lev:3:1">1</a> And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. <a name="an_lev:3:2">2</a> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about. <a name="an_lev:3:3">3</a> And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <a name="an_lev:3:4">4</a> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away hard by the kidneys. <a name="an_lev:3:5">5</a> And Aaron's sons shall make it smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:3:6">6</a> And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD be of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. <a name="an_lev:3:7">7</a> If he bring a lamb for his offering, then <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a> shall he present it before the LORD. <a name="an_lev:3:8">8</a> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. <a name="an_lev:3:9">9</a> And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, which he shall take away hard by the rump-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <a name="an_lev:3:10">10</a> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. <a name="an_lev:3:11">11</a> And the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:3:12">12</a> And if his offering be a goat, then he shall present it before the LORD. <a name="an_lev:3:13">13</a> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. <a name="an_lev:3:14">14</a> And he shall present thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <a name="an_lev:3:15">15</a> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. <a name="an_lev:3:16">16</a> And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour; all the fat is the LORD'S. <a name="an_lev:3:17">17</a> It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.</p>
