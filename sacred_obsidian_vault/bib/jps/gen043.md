 <p><a name="an_gen:43:1">1</a> And the famine was sore in the land. <a name="an_gen:43:2">2</a> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a> father said unto them: 'Go again, buy us a little food.' <a name="an_gen:43:3">3</a> And Judah spoke unto him, saying: 'The man did earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. <a name="an_gen:43:4">4</a> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food; <a name="an_gen:43:5">5</a> but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.' <a name="an_gen:43:6">6</a> And Israel said: 'Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?' <a name="an_gen:43:7">7</a> And they said: 'The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor-of these words; could we in any wise know that he would say: Bring your brother down?' <a name="an_gen:43:8">8</a> And Judah said unto Israel his father: 'Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. <a name="an_gen:43:9">9</a> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever. <a name="an_gen:43:10">10</a> For except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.' <a name="an_gen:43:11">11</a> And their father Israel said unto them: 'If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and ladanum, nuts, and almonds; <a name="an_gen:43:12">12</a> and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight; <a name="an_gen:43:13">13</a> take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man; <a name="an_gen:43:14">14</a> and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:43:15">15</a> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. <a name="an_gen:43:16">16</a> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: 'Bring the men into the house, and kill the beasts, and prepare the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon.' <a name="an_gen:43:17">17</a> And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. <a name="an_gen:43:18">18</a> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said: 'Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen; and our asses.' <a name="an_gen:43:19">19</a> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house, <a name="an_gen:43:20">20</a> and said: 'Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food. <a name="an_gen:43:21">21</a> And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand. <a name="an_gen:43:22">22</a> And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.' <a name="an_gen:43:23">23</a> And he said: 'Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.' And he brought Simeon out unto them. <a name="an_gen:43:24">24</a> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. <a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a> <a name="an_gen:43:25">25</a> And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there. <a name="an_gen:43:26">26</a> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down to him to the earth. <a name="an_gen:43:27">27</a> And he asked them of their welfare, and said: 'Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?' <a name="an_gen:43:28">28</a> And they said: 'Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive.' And they bowed the head, and made obeisance. <a name="an_gen:43:29">29</a> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said: 'Is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto me?' And he said: 'God be gracious unto thee, my son.' <a name="an_gen:43:30">30</a> And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. <a name="an_gen:43:31">31</a> And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said: 'Set on bread.' <a name="an_gen:43:32">32</a> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. <a name="an_gen:43:33">33</a> And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one with another. <a name="an_gen:43:34">34</a> And portions were taken unto them from before him; but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
