 <p><a name="an_lev:23:1">1</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:23:2">2</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:</p>  
 <p>The appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons. <a name="an_lev:23:3">3</a> Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work; it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:4">4</a> These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. <a name="an_lev:23:5">5</a> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the LORD'S passover. <a name="an_lev:23:6">6</a> And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. <a name="an_lev:23:7">7</a> In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <a name="an_lev:23:8">8</a> And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:9">9</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:23:10">10</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:</p>  
 <p>When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest. <a name="an_lev:23:11">11</a> And he shall wave <a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></a> the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. <a name="an_lev:23:12">12</a> And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:23:13">13</a> And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin. <a name="an_lev:23:14">14</a> And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:15">15</a> And ye shall count unto you from morrow after the  <a name="fr_93"></a><a href="#fn_90"><font size="1">a</font></a>
  day of rest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete; <a name="an_lev:23:16">16</a> even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:23:17">17</a> Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:23:18">18</a> And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be a burnt-offering unto the LORD, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:23:19">19</a> And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings. <a name="an_lev:23:20">20</a> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. <a name="an_lev:23:21">21</a> And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:22">22</a> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:23">23</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: <a name="an_lev:23:24">24</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:</p>  
 <p>In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation. <a name="an_lev:23:25">25</a> Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:26">26</a> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:27">27</a> Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:23:28">28</a> And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God. <a name="an_lev:23:29">29</a> For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. <a name="an_lev:23:30">30</a> And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. <a name="an_lev:23:31">31</a> Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></a> your dwellings. <a name="an_lev:23:32">32</a> It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.</p>

 <p>On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. <a name="an_lev:23:35">35</a> On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <a name="an_lev:23:36">36</a> Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:37">37</a> These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day; <a name="an_lev:23:38">38</a> beside the Sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:23:39">39</a> Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the LORD seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be, a solemn rest. <a name="an_lev:23:40">40</a> And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. <a name="an_lev:23:41">41</a> And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in thé year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month. <a name="an_lev:23:42">42</a> Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths; <a name="an_lev:23:43">43</a> that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
