 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:1">1</a> And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt; they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:2">2</a> And Solomon's provision for one</p>  
 <p><a name="page_408"><font size="1" color="green">p. 408</font></a></p>  
 <p>day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; <a name="an_kg1:5:3">3</a> ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. <a name="an_kg1:5:4">4</a> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides round about him. <a name="an_kg1:5:5">5</a> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:6">6</a> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. <a name="an_kg1:5:7">7</a> And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. <a name="an_kg1:5:8">8</a> Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:9">9</a> And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. <a name="an_kg1:5:10">10</a> And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. <a name="an_kg1:5:11">11</a> For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about. <a name="an_kg1:5:12">12</a> And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. <a name="an_kg1:5:13">13</a> And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. <a name="an_kg1:5:14">14</a> And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:15">15</a> And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was ever a lover of David. <a name="an_kg1:5:16">16</a> And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying: <a name="an_kg1:5:17">17</a> 'Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of my feet. <a name="an_kg1:5:18">18</a> But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence. <a name="an_kg1:5:19">19</a> And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for My name. <a name="an_kg1:5:20">20</a> Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:21">21</a> And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said: `Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.' <a name="an_kg1:5:22">22</a> And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: `I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress. <a name="an_kg1:5:23">23</a> My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="green">p. 409</font></a></p>  
 <p>and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.' <a name="an_kg1:5:24">24</a> So  <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire. <a name="an_kg1:5:25">25</a> And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. <a name="an_kg1:5:26">26</a> And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:5:27">27</a> And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. <a name="an_kg1:5:28">28</a> And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy. <a name="an_kg1:5:29">29</a> And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; <a name="an_kg1:5:30">30</a> besides Solomon's chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. <a name="an_kg1:5:31">31</a> And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stories, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone. <a name="an_kg1:5:32">32</a> And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.</p>
