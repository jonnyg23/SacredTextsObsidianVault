 <p><a name="an_lev:9:1">1</a> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; <a name="an_lev:9:2">2</a> and he said unto Aaron: 'Take thee a bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. <a name="an_lev:9:3">3</a> And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; <a name="an_lev:9:4">4</a> and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day the LORD appeareth <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></a> unto you.' <a name="an_lev:9:5">5</a> And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. <a name="an_lev:9:6">6</a> And Moses said: 'This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do; that the glory of the LORD may appear unto you.' <a name="an_lev:9:7">7</a> And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.' <a name="an_lev:9:8">8</a> So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. <a name="an_lev:9:9">9</a> And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. <a name="an_lev:9:10">10</a> But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. <a name="an_lev:9:11">11</a> And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp. <a name="an_lev:9:12">12</a> And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about. <a name="an_lev:9:13">13</a> And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar. <a name="an_lev:9:14">14</a> And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar. <a name="an_lev:9:15">15</a> And the people's offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. <a name="an_lev:9:16">16</a> And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance. <a name="an_lev:9:17">17</a> And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning. <a name="an_lev:9:18">18</a> He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about, <a name="an_lev:9:19">19</a> and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver. <a name="an_lev:9:20">20</a> And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar. <a name="an_lev:9:21">21</a> And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. <a name="an_lev:9:22">22</a> And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings. <a name="an_lev:9:23">23</a> And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. <a name="an_lev:9:24">24</a> And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
