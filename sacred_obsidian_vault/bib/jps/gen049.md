 <p><a name="an_gen:49:16">16</a> Dan shall judge his people,<br> As one of the tribes of Israel.<br> <a name="an_gen:49:17">17</a> Dan shall be a serpent in the way,<br> A horned snake in the path,<br> That biteth the horse's heels,<br> So that his rider falleth backward.<br> <a name="an_gen:49:18">18</a> I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord.</p>
