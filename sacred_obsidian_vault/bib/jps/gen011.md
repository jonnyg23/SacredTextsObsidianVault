 <p><a name="an_gen:11:1">1</a> And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. <a name="an_gen:11:2">2</a> And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. <a name="an_gen:11:3">3</a> And they said one to another: 'Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.' And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. <a name="an_gen:11:4">4</a> And they said: 'Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' <a name="an_gen:11:5">5</a> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. <a name="an_gen:11:6">6</a> And the LORD said: 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. <a name="an_gen:11:7">7</a> Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.' <a name="an_gen:11:8">8</a> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. <a name="an_gen:11:9">9</a> Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there  <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:10">10</a> These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood. <a name="an_gen:11:11">11</a> And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:12">12</a> And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begot Shelah. <a name="an_gen:11:13">13</a> And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:14">14</a> And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. <a name="an_gen:11:15">15</a> And Shelah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:16">16</a> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg. <a name="an_gen:11:17">17</a> And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:18">18</a> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. <a name="an_gen:11:19">19</a> And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:20">20</a> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug. <a name="an_gen:11:21">21</a> And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:22">22</a> And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor. <a name="an_gen:11:23">23</a> And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:24">24</a> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah. <a name="an_gen:11:25">25</a> And Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:26">26</a> And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_gen:11:27">27</a> Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot. <a name="an_gen:11:28">28</a> And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. <a name="an_gen:11:29">29</a> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. <a name="an_gen:11:30">30</a> And Sarai was barren; she had no child. <a name="an_gen:11:31">31</a> And Terah took Abram his <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a> son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. <a name="an_gen:11:32">32</a> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.</p>
