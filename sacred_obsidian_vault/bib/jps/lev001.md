 <p><a name="an_lev:1:1">1</a> AND the LORD called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying: <a name="an_lev:1:2">2</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:</p>  
 <p>When any man of you bringeth an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:1:3">3</a> If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD. <a name="an_lev:1:4">4</a> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. <a name="an_lev:1:5">5</a> And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. <a name="an_lev:1:6">6</a> And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. <a name="an_lev:1:7">7</a> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire. <a name="an_lev:1:8">8</a> And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar; <a name="an_lev:1:9">9</a> but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:1:10">10</a> And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish. <a name="an_lev:1:11">11</a> And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about. <a name="an_lev:1:12">12</a> And he shall cut it into its pieces; and the priest shall lay them, with its head and its suet, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar. <a name="an_lev:1:13">13</a> But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_lev:1:14">14</a> And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. <a name="an_lev:1:15">15</a> And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar. <a name="an_lev:1:16">16</a> And he shall take away its crop with the feathers thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes. <a name="an_lev:1:17">17</a> And he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
