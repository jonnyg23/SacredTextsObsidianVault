 <p><a name="an_jdg:8:1">1</a> And the men of Ephraim said unto him: `Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?' And they did chide with him sharply. <a name="an_jdg:8:2">2</a> And he said unto them: `What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? <a name="an_jdg:8:3">3</a> God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?' Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></a></p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:8:4">4</a> And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing. <a name="an_jdg:8:5">5</a> And he said unto the men of Succoth: `Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.' <a name="an_jdg:8:6">6</a> And the princes of Succoth said: `Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thine army?' <a name="an_jdg:8:7">7</a> And Gideon said: `Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.' <a name="an_jdg:8:8">8</a> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. <a name="an_jdg:8:9">9</a> And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: `When I come back in peace, I will break down this tower.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:8:10">10</a> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. <a name="an_jdg:8:11">11</a> And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure. <a name="an_jdg:8:12">12</a> And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. <a name="an_jdg:8:13">13</a> And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres. <a name="an_jdg:8:14">14</a> And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men. <a name="an_jdg:8:15">15</a> And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: `Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?' <a name="an_jdg:8:16">16</a> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. <a name="an_jdg:8:17">17</a> And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. <a name="an_jdg:8:18">18</a> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: `Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?' And they answered: `As thou art, so were they; of one form with the children of a king.' <a name="an_jdg:8:19">19</a> And he said: `They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.' <a name="an_jdg:8:20">20</a> And he said unto Jether his first-born: `Up, and slay them.' But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth. <a name="an_jdg:8:21">21</a> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: `Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.' And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:8:22">22</a> Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: `Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.' <a name="an_jdg:8:23">23</a> And Gideon said unto them: `I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.' <a name="an_jdg:8:24">24</a> And Gideon said unto them: `I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.'—For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites. <a name="an_jdg:8:25">25</a> And they answered: `We will willingly give them.' And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil. <a name="an_jdg:8:26">26</a> And</p>  
 <p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p>the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. <a name="an_jdg:8:27">27</a> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city; even in Ophrah; and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. <a name="an_jdg:8:28">28</a> So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:8:29">29</a> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. <a name="an_jdg:8:30">30</a> And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives. <a name="an_jdg:8:31">31</a> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. <a name="an_jdg:8:32">32</a> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:8:33">33</a> And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god. <a name="an_jdg:8:34">34</a> And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side; <a name="an_jdg:8:35">35</a> neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown unto Israel.</p>
