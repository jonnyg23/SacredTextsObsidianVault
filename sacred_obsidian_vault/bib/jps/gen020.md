 <p><a name="an_gen:20:1">1</a> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. <a name="an_gen:20:2">2</a> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife: 'She is my sister.' And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. <a name="an_gen:20:3">3</a> But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him: 'Behold, thou shalt die, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.' <a name="an_gen:20:4">4</a> Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said: 'Lord, wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation? <a name="an_gen:20:5">5</a> Said he not himself unto me: She is my sister? and she, even she herself said: He is my brother. In the simplicity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.' <a name="an_gen:20:6">6</a> And God said unto him in the dream: 'Yea, I know that in the simplicity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. <a name="an_gen:20:7">7</a> Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.' <a name="an_gen:20:8">8</a> And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were sore afraid. <a name="an_gen:20:9">9</a> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him: 'What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.' <a name="an_gen:20:10">10</a> And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?' <a name="an_gen:20:11">11</a> And Abraham said: 'Because I thought: Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. <a name="an_gen:20:12">12</a> And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife. <a name="an_gen:20:13">13</a> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her: This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me: He is my brother.' <a name="an_gen:20:14">14</a> And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. <a name="an_gen:20:15">15</a> And Abimelech said: 'Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.' <a name="an_gen:20:16">16</a> And unto Sarah he said: 'Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and before all men thou art righted.' <a name="an_gen:20:17">17</a> And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children. <a name="an_gen:20:18">18</a> For the LORD had fast <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a> closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p>
