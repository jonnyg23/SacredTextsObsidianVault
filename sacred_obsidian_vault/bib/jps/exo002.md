 <p><a name="an_exo:2:1">1</a> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. <a name="an_exo:2:2">2</a> And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a> she hid him three months. <a name="an_exo:2:3">3</a> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink. <a name="an_exo:2:4">4</a> And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. <a name="an_exo:2:6">6</a> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. <a name="an_exo:2:6">6</a> And she opened it, and saw it, even the child; and behold a boy that wept. And she had compassion on him, and said: 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.' <a name="an_exo:2:7">7</a> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter: 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?' <a name="an_exo:2:8">8</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: 'Go.' And the maiden went and called the child's mother. <a name="an_exo:2:9">9</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her: 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it. <a name="an_exo:2:10">10</a> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name  <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Moses, and said: 'Because I  <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">b</font></a>
 drew him out of the water.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:2:11">11</a> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. <a name="an_exo:2:12">12</a> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. <a name="an_exo:2:13">13</a> And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together; and he said to him that did the wrong: 'Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?' <a name="an_exo:2:14">14</a> And he said: 'Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian?' And Moses feared, and said: 'Surely the thing is known.' <a name="an_exo:2:15">15</a> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. <a name="an_exo:2:16">16</a> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. <a name="an_exo:2:17">17</a> And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. <a name="an_exo:2:18">18</a> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said: 'How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?' <a name="an_exo:2:19">19</a> And they said: 'An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.' <a name="an_exo:2:20">20</a> And he said unto his daughters: 'And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.' <a name="an_exo:2:21">21</a> And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. <a name="an_exo:2:22">22</a> And she bore a son, and he called' his name Gershom; for he said: 'I have been  <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">c</font></a>
 a stranger in a strange land.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:2:23">23</a> And it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. <a name="an_exo:2:24">24</a> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. <a name="an_exo:2:25">25</a> And God saw the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.</p>
