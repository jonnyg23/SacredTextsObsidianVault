 <p><a name="an_exo:8:1">1</a> <span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.' <a name="an_exo:8:2">2</a> And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. <a name="an_exo:8:3">3</a> And the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. <a name="an_exo:8:4">4</a> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: 'Entreat the LORD, that He take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto the LORD.' <a name="an_exo:8:5">5</a> And Moses said unto Pharaoh: 'Have thou this glory over me; against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?' <a name="an_exo:8:6">6</a> And he said: 'Against to-morrow.' And he said: 'Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. <a name="an_exo:8:7">7</a> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.' <a name="an_exo:8:8">8</a> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the LORD concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh. <a name="an_exo:8:9">9</a> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. <a name="an_exo:8:10">10</a> And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank. "But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:8:12">12</a> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.' <a name="an_exo:8:13">13</a> And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt. <a name="an_exo:8:14">14</a> And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast. <a name="an_exo:8:15">15</a> Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: 'This is the finger of God'; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as. the LORD had spoken.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:8:16">16</a> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. <a name="an_exo:8:17">17</a> Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. <a name="an_exo:8:18">18</a> And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end that thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. <a name="an_exo:8:19">19</a> And I will put a division between My people and thy people—by to-morrow shall this sign be.' <a name="an_exo:8:20">20</a> And the LORD did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></a> houses; and in all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies. <a name="an_exo:8:21">21</a> And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said: 'Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.' <a name="an_exo:8:22">22</a> And Moses said: 'It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God; lo, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians be fore their eyes, will they not stone us? <a name="an_exo:8:23">23</a> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as He shall command us.' <a name="an_exo:8:24">24</a> And Pharaoh said: 'I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for me.' <a name="an_exo:8:25">25</a> And Moses said: 'Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.' <a name="an_exo:8:26">26</a> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD. <a name="an_exo:8:27">27</a> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. <a name="an_exo:8:28">28</a> And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.</p>
