 <p><a name="an_jdg:7:1">1</a> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside En-harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:7:2">2</a> And the LORD said unto Gideon: `The people that are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying: Mine own hand hath saved me. <a name="an_jdg:7:3">3</a> Now therefore make proclamation in the ears of the people, saying: Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.' And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:7:4">4</a> And the LORD said unto Gideon: `The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.' <a name="an_jdg:7:5">5</a> So he brought down the people unto the water; and the LORD said unto Gideon: `Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.' <a name="an_jdg:7:6">6</a> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. <a name="an_jdg:7:7">7</a> And the LORD said unto Gideon: `By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.' <a name="an_jdg:7:8">8</a> So they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:7:9">9</a> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him: `Arise, get thee down upon the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand. <a name="an_jdg:7:10">10</a> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp. <a name="an_jdg:7:11">11</a> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down upon the camp.' Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp. <a name="an_jdg:7:12">12</a> Now the Midianites and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude. <a name="an_jdg:7:13">13</a> And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his fellow, and saying: `Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay flat.' <a name="an_jdg:7:14">14</a> And his fellow answered and said: `This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:7:15">15</a> And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said: `Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.' <a name="an_jdg:7:16">16</a> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them horns, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. <a name="an_jdg:7:17">17</a> And he said unto them: `Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. <a name="an_jdg:7:18">18</a> When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For the LORD and for Gideon!'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_jdg:7:19">19</a> So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the horns, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands. <a name="an_jdg:7:20">20</a> And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: `The sword for the LORD and for Gideon!' <a name="an_jdg:7:21">21</a> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled. <a name="an_jdg:7:22">22</a> And they blew the three hundred horns, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. <a name="an_jdg:7:23">23</a> And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian. <a name="an_jdg:7:24">24</a> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying: `Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.' So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. <a name="an_jdg:7:25">25</a> And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the Winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</p>
