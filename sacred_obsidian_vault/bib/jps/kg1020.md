 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:1">1</a> And Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. <a name="an_kg1:20:2">2</a> And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, <a name="an_kg1:20:3">3</a> and said unto him: `Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.' <a name="an_kg1:20:4">4</a> And the king of Israel answered and said: `It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king: I am thine, and all that I have.' <a name="an_kg1:20:5">5</a> And the messengers came again, and said: `Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying: I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; <a name="an_kg1:20:6">6</a> but I will send my servants unto thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:7">7</a> Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said: `Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief; for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.' <a name="an_kg1:20:8">8</a> And all the elders and all the people said unto him: `Hearken thou not, neither consent.' <a name="an_kg1:20:9">9</a> Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad: `Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.' And the messengers departed, and brought him back word. <a name="an_kg1:20:10">10</a> And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said: `The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.' <a name="an_kg1:20:11">11</a> And the king of Israel answered and said: `Tell him: Let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth it off.' <a name="an_kg1:20:12">12</a> And it came to pass, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said unto his servants: `Set yourselves in array.' And they set themselves in array against the city.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:13">13</a> And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said: `Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.' <a name="an_kg1:20:14">14</a> And Ahab said: `By whom?' And he said: `Thus saith the LORD: By the young men of the princes of the provinces.' Then he said: `Who shall begin the battle?' And he answered: `Thou.' <a name="an_kg1:20:15">15</a> Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were</p>  
 <p><a name="page_435"><font size="1" color="green">p. 435</font></a></p>  
 <p>two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:16">16</a> And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. <a name="an_kg1:20:17">17</a> And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying: `There are men come out from Samaria.' <a name="an_kg1:20:18">18</a> And he said: `Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.' <a name="an_kg1:20:19">19</a> So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. <a name="an_kg1:20:20">20</a> And they slew every one his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Benhadad the king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. <a name="an_kg1:20:21">21</a> And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter. <a name="an_kg1:20:22">22</a> And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him: `Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:23">23</a> And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him: `Their God is a God of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. <a name="an_kg1:20:24">24</a> And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their room: <a name="an_kg1:20:25">25</a> and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.' And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:26">26</a> And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. <a name="an_kg1:20:27">27</a> And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks cf kids; but the Arameans filled the country. <a name="an_kg1:20:28">28</a> And a man of God came near and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said: `Thus saith the LORD: Because the Arameans have said: The LORD is a God of the hills, but he is not a God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.' <a name="an_kg1:20:29">29</a> And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day. <a name="an_kg1:20:30">30</a> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:31">31</a> And his servants said unto him: `Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will save thy life.' <a name="an_kg1:20:32">32</a> So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said: `Thy servant Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.' And he said: `Is he yet alive? he is my brother.' <a name="an_kg1:20:33">33</a> Now the men took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from</p>  
 <p><a name="page_436"><font size="1" color="green">p. 436</font></a></p>  
 <p>him; and they said: `Thy brother Ben-hadad.' Then he said: `Go ye, bring him.' Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into his chariot. <a name="an_kg1:20:34">34</a> And [Ben-hadad] said unto him: `The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.' `And I [,said Ahab,] will let thee go with this covenant.' So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg1:20:35">35</a> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the LORD: `Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man refused to smite him. <a name="an_kg1:20:36">36</a> Then said he unto him: `Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.' And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him; and slew him. <a name="an_kg1:20:37">37</a> Then he found another man, and said: `Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him. <a name="an_kg1:20:38">38</a> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. <a name="an_kg1:20:39">39</a> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said: `Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said: Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. <a name="an_kg1:20:40">40</a> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.' And the king of Israel said unto him: `So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.' <a name="an_kg1:20:41">41</a> And he hastened, and took the headband away' from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. <a name="an_kg1:20:42">42</a> And he said unto him: `Thus saith the LORD: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.' <a name="an_kg1:20:43">43</a> And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria.</p>
