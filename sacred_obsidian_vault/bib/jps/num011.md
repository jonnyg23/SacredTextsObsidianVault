 <p><a name="an_num:11:1">1</a> And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of the LORD; and when the LORD heard it, His anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. <a name="an_num:11:2">2</a> And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the LORD, and the fire abated. <a name="an_num:11:3">3</a> And the name of that place was called  <a name="fr_95"></a><a href="#fn_92"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:11:4">4</a> And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept on their part, and said: `Would that we were given flesh to eat! <a name="an_num:11:5">5</a> We remember the fish, which we were wont to eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; <a name="an_num:11:6">6</a> but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all; we have nought save this manna to look to.'— <a name="an_num:11:7">7</a> Now the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. <a name="an_num:11:8">8</a> The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>cake baked with oil. <a name="an_num:11:9">9</a> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.— <a name="an_num:11:10">10</a> And Moses heard the people weeping, family by family, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. <a name="an_num:11:11">11</a> And Moses said unto the LORD: `Wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with Thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in Thy sight, that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? <a name="an_num:11:12">12</a> Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that Thou shouldest say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which Thou didst swear unto their fathers? <a name="an_num:11:13">13</a> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they trouble me with their weeping, saying: Give us flesh, that we may eat. <a name="an_num:11:14">14</a> I am not able to bear all this people myself alone, because it is too heavy for me. <a name="an_num:11:15">15</a> And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in Thy sight; and let me not look upon my wretchedness.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:11:16">16</a> And the LORD said unto Moses: `Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee. <a name="an_num:11:17">17</a> And I will come down and speak with thee there; and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. <a name="an_num:11:18">18</a> And say thou unto the people: Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying: Would that we were given flesh to eat! for it was well with us in Egypt; therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. <a name="an_num:11:19">19</a> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; <a name="an_num:11:20">20</a> but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected the LORD who is among you, and have troubled Him with weeping, saying: Why, now, came we forth out of Egypt?' <a name="an_num:11:21">21</a> And Moses said: `The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and yet Thou hast said: I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month! <a name="an_num:11:22">22</a> If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them? or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, will they suffice them?' <a name="an_num:11:23">23</a> And the LORD said unto Moses: `Is the LORD's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether My word shall come to pass unto thee or not.'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:11:24">24</a> And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. <a name="an_num:11:25">25</a> And the LORD came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders; and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. <a name="an_num:11:26">26</a> But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were recorded, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. <a name="an_num:11:27">27</a> And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said: `Eldad and Medad are</p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>prophesying in the camp.' <a name="an_num:11:28">28</a> And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth up, answered and said: `My lord Moses, shut them in.' <a name="an_num:11:29">29</a> And Moses said unto him: `Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put His spirit upon them!' <a name="an_num:11:30">30</a> And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_num:11:31">31</a> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought across quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. <a name="an_num:11:32">32</a> And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails; he that gathered least gathered ten heaps; and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. <a name="an_num:11:33">33</a> While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. <a name="an_num:11:34">34</a> And the name of that place was called  <a name="fr_96"></a><a href="#fn_93"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted. <a name="an_num:11:35">35</a> From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</p>
