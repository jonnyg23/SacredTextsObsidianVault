 <p><a name="an_jdg:19:1">1</a> And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the</p>

 <p>hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem in Judah. <a name="an_jdg:19:2">2</a> And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months. <a name="an_jdg:19:3">3</a> And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her back, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses; and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. <a name="an_jdg:19:4">4</a> And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. <a name="an_jdg:19:5">5</a> And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law: `Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.' <a name="an_jdg:19:6">6</a> So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together; and the damsel's father said unto the man: `Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.' <a name="an_jdg:19:7">7</a> And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again. <a name="an_jdg:19:8">8</a> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said: `Stay thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth'; and they did eat, both of them. <a name="an_jdg:19:9">9</a> And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him: `Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.' <a name="an_jdg:19:10">10</a> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus—the same is Jersualem; and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him. <a name="an_jdg:19:11">11</a> When they were by Jebus—the day was far spent—the servant said unto his master: `Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.' <a name="an_jdg:19:12">12</a> And his master said unto him: `We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.' <a name="an_jdg:19:13">13</a> And he said unto his servant: `Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.' <a name="an_jdg:19:14">14</a> So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. <a name="an_jdg:19:15">15</a> And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and he went in, and sat him down in the broad place of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge. <a name="an_jdg:19:16">16</a> And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites. <a name="an_jdg:19:17">17</a> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the broad place of the city; and the old man said: `Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?' <a name="an_jdg:19:18">18</a> And he said unto him: `We are passing from Beth-lehem in Judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that taketh me into his house. <a name="an_jdg:19:19">19</a> Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></a></p>  
 <p>and for the young man that is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.' <a name="an_jdg:19:20">20</a> And the old man said: `Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.' <a name="an_jdg:19:21">21</a> So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. <a name="an_jdg:19:22">22</a> As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying: `Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.' <a name="an_jdg:19:23">23</a> And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: `Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this wanton deed. <a name="an_jdg:19:24">24</a> Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you; but unto this man do not so wanton a thing.' <a name="an_jdg:19:25">25</a> But the men would not hearken to him; so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go. <a name="an_jdg:19:26">26</a> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. <a name="an_jdg:19:27">27</a> And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. <a name="an_jdg:19:28">28</a> And he said unto her: `Up, and let us be going'; but none answered; then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and got him unto his place. <a name="an_jdg:19:29">29</a> And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. <a name="an_jdg:19:30">30</a> And it was so, that all that saw it said: `Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.'</p>
