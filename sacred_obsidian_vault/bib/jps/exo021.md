 <p align="center">‏משפטים‎</p>  <h3 align="center">EXODUS CHAPTER 21</h3>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:1">1</a> Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. <a name="an_exo:21:2">2</a> If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. <a name="an_exo:21:3">3</a> If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. <a name="an_exo:21:4">4</a> If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. <a name="an_exo:21:5">5</a> But if the servant shall plainly say: I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free; <a name="an_exo:21:6">6</a> then his master shall bring him unto  <a name="fr_85"></a><a href="#fn_84"><font size="1">a</font></a>
 God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:7">7</a> And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. <a name="an_exo:21:8">8</a> If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed; to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. <a name="an_exo:21:9">9</a> And if he espouse leer unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. <a name="an_exo:21:10">10</a> If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights, shall he not diminish. <a name="an_exo:21:11">11</a> And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:12">12</a> He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death. <a name="an_exo:21:13">13</a> And if a man lie not in wait, but God cause it to come to hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he may flee.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:14">14</a> And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:15">15</a> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:16">16</a> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:17">17</a> And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:18">18</a> And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed; <a name="an_exo:21:19">19</a> if he rise again, and walls abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:20">20</a> And if a man smite his bondman, or his bondwoman, with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall surely be punished. <a name="an_exo:21:21">21</a> Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:22">22</a> And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. <a name="an_exo:21:23">23</a> But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life, <a name="an_exo:21:24">24</a> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, <a name="an_exo:21:25">25</a> burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:26">26</a> And if a man smite the eye of his bondman, or the eye of his bondwoman, and destroy it, he shall let him go free. for his eye's sake. <a name="an_exo:21:27">27</a> And if he smite out his bondman's tooth, or his bond: woman's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:28">28</a> And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. <a name="an_exo:21:29">29</a> But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and warning hath been given to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. <a name="an_exo:21:30">30</a> If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. <a name="an_exo:21:31">31</a> Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. <a name="an_exo:21:32">32</a> If the ox gore a bondman or a bondwoman, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:33">33</a> And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, <a name="an_exo:21:34">34</a> the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the <a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a> owner of them, and the dead beast shall be his.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:35">35</a> And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide. <a name="an_exo:21:36">36</a> Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_exo:21:37">37</a> If a man steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</p>
