 </i><p align="CENTER">This Ode is as beautiful in style as the canonical Psalter.</p> 
 <p>1 As the eyes of a son to his father, so are my eyes, O Lord, at all times towards thee.<br> 2 For with thee are my consolations and my delight.<br> 3 Turn not away thy mercies from me, O Lord: and take not thy kindness from me.<br> 4 Stretch out to me, O Lord, at all times thy right hand: and be my guide even unto the end, according to thy good pleasure.<br> 5 Let me be well-pleasing before thee, because of thy glory and because of thy name:<br> 6 Let me be preserved from evil, and let thy meekness, O Lord, abide with me, and the fruits of thy love.<br> 7 Teach me the Psalms of thy truth, that I may bring forth fruit in thee:<br> 8 And open to me the harp of thy Holy Spirit, that with all its notes I may praise thee, O Lord.<br> 9 And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, so thou shalt give to me; and hasten to grant our petitions; and thou art able for all our needs. Hallelujah.</p>
