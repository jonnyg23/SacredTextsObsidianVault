 <p>AND when they had ended their prayer, the Word of God came and comforted them concerning their father Adam.</p> 
 <p>2 After this, they offered their gifts for themselves and for their father.</p> 
 <p>3 And when they had ended their offering, the Word of God came to Seth, the eldest among them, saying unto him, "O Seth, Seth, Seth, three times. As I was with thy father, so also shall I be with thee, until the fulfilment of the promise I made him-thy father saying, I will send My Word and save thee and thy seed.</p> 
 <p>4 But as to thy father Adam, keep thou the commandment he gave thee; and sever thy seed from that of Cain thy brother."</p> 
 <p>5 And God withdrew His Word from Seth.</p> 
 <p>6 Then Seth, Eve, and their children, came down from the mountain to the Cave of Treasures.</p> 
 <p>7 But Adam was the first whose soul died in the land of Eden, in the Cave of Treasures; for no one died before him, but his son Abel, who died murdered.</p> 
 <p>8 Then all the children of Adam rose up, and wept over their father Adam, and made offerings to him, one hundred and forty days.</p>
