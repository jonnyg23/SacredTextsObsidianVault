 </i><p align="CENTER">Again reminiscent of the Psalms, of David.</p> 
 <p>1 The Lord is my hope: in Him I shall not be confounded.<br> 2 For according to His praise He made me, and according to His goodness even so He gave unto me:<br> 3 And according to His mercies He exalted me: and according to His excellent beauty He set me on high:<br> 4 And brought me up out of the depths of Sheol: and from the mouth of death He drew me:<br> 5 And thou didst lay my enemies low, and He justified me by His grace.<br> 6 For I believed in the Lord's Messiah: and it appeared to me that He is the Lord;<br> 7 And He showed him His sign: and He led me by His light, and gave me the rod of His power;<br> 8 That I might subdue the imaginations of the peoples; and the power of the men of might to bring them low:<br> 9 To make war by His word, and to take victory by His power.<br> 10 And the Lord overthrew my enemy by His word: and <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></a> he became like the stubble which the wind carries away;<br> 11 And I gave praise to the Most High because He exalted me His servant and the son of His handmaid. Hallelujah.</p>
