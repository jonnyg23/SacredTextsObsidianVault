 </i><p align="CENTER">A recollection of the glorious days in the Garden.</p> 
 <p>THEN Adam and Eve felt themselves burning with thirst, and heat, and sorrow.</p> 
 <p>2 And Adam said to Eve, "We shall not drink of this water, even if we were to die. O Eve, when this water comes into our inner parts, it will increase our punishments and that of our children, that shall come after us."</p> 
 <p>3 Both Adam and Eve then withdrew from the water, and drank none of it at all; but came and entered the Cave of Treasures.</p> 
 <p>4 But when in it Adam could not see Eve; he only heard the noise she made. Neither could she see Adam, but heard the noise he made.</p> 
 <p>5 Then Adam wept, in deep affliction, and smote upon his breast; and he arose and said to Eve, "Where art thou?"</p> 
 <p>6 And she said unto him, "Lo, I am standing in this darkness."</p> 
 <p>7 He then said to her, "Remember the bright nature in which we lived, while we abode in the garden!</p> 
 <p>8 "O Eve! remember the glory that rested on us in the garden. O Eve! remember the trees that overshadowed us in the garden while we moved among them.</p> 
 <p>9 "O Eve! remember that while we were in the garden, we knew neither night nor day.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Think of the Tree of Life, from below which flowed the water, and that shed lustre over us! Remember, O Eve, the garden-land, and the brightness thereof!</p> 
 <p>10 "Think, oh think of that garden in which was no darkness, while we dwelt therein.</p> 
 <p>11 "Whereas no sooner did we come into this Cave of Treasures than darkness compassed us round about; until we can no longer see each other; and all the pleasure of this life has come to an end."</p>
