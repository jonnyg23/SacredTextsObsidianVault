 </i><p align="CENTER">We discover that the writer may be a Gentile (v. 8).</p> 
 <p>1 All the Lord's children will praise Him, and will collect the truth of His faith.<br> 2 And His children shall be known to Him. Therefore we will sing in His love:<br> 3 We live in the Lord by His grace: and life we receive in His Messiah:<br> 4 For a great day has shined upon us: and marvellous is He who has given us of His glory.<br> 5 Let us, therefore, all of us unite together in the name of the Lord, and let us honour Him in His goodness,<br> 6 And let our faces shine in His light: and let our hearts meditate in His love by night and by day.<br> 7 Let us exult with the joy of the Lord.<br> 8 All those will be astonished that see me. For from another race am I:<br> 9 For the Father of truth remembered me: He who possessed me from the beginning:<br> 10 For His bounty begat me, and the thought of His heart:<br> 11 And His Word is with us in all our way;<br> 12 The Saviour who makes alive and does not reject our souls-;<br> 13 The man who was humbled, and exalted by His own righteousness,<br> 14 The Son of the Most High appeared in the perfection of His Father;<br> 15 And light dawned from the Word that was beforetime in Him;<br> 16 The Messiah is truly one; and He was known before the foundation of the world,<br> 17 That He might save souls for ever by the truth of His name: a new song arises from those who love Him. Hallelujah.</p>
