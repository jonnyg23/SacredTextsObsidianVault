 </i><p align="CENTER">An appeal for family tranquility and peace and quiet at home.</p> 
 <p>O Lord, deliver my soul from the lawless and wicked man,<br>   From the tongue that is lawless and slanderous, and speaketh lies and deceit.<br> Manifoldly twisted are the words of the tongue of the wicked man,<br>   Even as among a people a fire that burneth up their beauty.<br> So he delights to fill houses with a lying tongue,<br>   To cut down the trees of gladness which setteth on fire transgressors,<br>   To involve households in warfare by means of slanderous lips.</p> 
 <p>May God remove far from the innocent the lips of transgressors by bringing them to want<br>   And may the bones of slanderers be scattered far away from them that fear the Lord!<br>   In flaming fire perish the slanderous tongue far away from the pious!<br> May the Lord preserve the quiet soul that hateth the unrighteous;<br>   And may the Lord establish the man that followeth peace at home.<br> The salvation of the Lord be upon Israel His servant for ever;<br>   And let the sinners perish together at the presence of the Lord;<br>   But let the Lord's pious ones inherit the promises of the Lord.</p>
