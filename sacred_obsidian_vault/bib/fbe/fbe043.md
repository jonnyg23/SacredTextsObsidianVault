 <p align="CENTER">"<i>When 5500 years are fulfilled</i> . . . ."</p> 
 <p>AFTER these things the Word of God came to Adam, and said unto him:--</p> 
 <p>2 "O Adam, as to the fruit of the Tree of Life, for which thou askest, I will not give it thee now, but when the 5500 years are fulfilled. Then will I give thee of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and thou shalt eat, and live for ever, thou, and Eve, and thy righteous seed.</p> 
 <p>3 "But these forty-three days cannot make amends for the hour in which thou didst transgress My commandment.</p> 
 <p>4 "O Adam, I gave thee to eat of the fig-tree in which thou didst hide thyself. Go and eat of it, thou and Eve.</p> 
 <p>5 "I will not deny thy request, neither will I disappoint thy hope; therefore, bear up unto the fulfilment of the covenant I made with thee."</p> 
 <p>6 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>
