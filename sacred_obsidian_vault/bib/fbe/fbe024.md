 <p>BUT Adam and Eve wept before God. And Adam said unto Him:--</p> 
 <p>2 "O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to Thee, my Lord, that the beasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from the earth."</p> 
 <p>3 Then Adam, by reason of what had befallen him, smote upon his breast, and fell upon the earth like a corpse; then came to him the Word of God,</p>

 <p>who raised him, and said unto him,</p> 
 <p>4 "O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt thee; because when I made the beasts and other moving things come to thee in the cave, I did not let the serpent come with them, lest it should rise against you, make you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into your hearts.</p> 
 <p>5 "For I knew that that accursed one is wicked; therefore would I not let it come near you with the other beasts.</p> 
 <p>6 "But now strengthen thy heart and fear not. I am with thee unto the end of the days I have determined on thee."</p>
