 </i><p>Enoch instructs his sons wherefore they may not touch beef because of what comes from it.</p> 
 <p>WHOEVER defiles the soul of beasts, defiles his own soul.</p> 
 <p>2 For man brings clean animals to make sacrifice for sin, that he may have cure of his soul.</p> 
 <p>3 And if they bring for sacrifice clean animals, and birds, man has cure, he cures his soul.</p> 
 <p>4 All is given you for food, bind it by the four feet, that is to make good the cure, he cures his soul.</p> 
 <p>5 But whoever kills beast without wounds, kills his own soul and defiles his own flesh.</p> 
 <p>6 And he who does any beast any injury whatsoever, in secret, it is evil practice, and he defiles his own soul.</p>
