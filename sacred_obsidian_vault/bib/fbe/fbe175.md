 <p>ENOCH was born on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, and lived three hundred and sixty-five years.</p> 
 <p>2 He was taken up to heaven on the first day of the month Tsivan and remained in heaven sixty days.</p> 
 <p>3 He wrote all these signs of all creation, which the Lord created, and wrote three hundred and sixty-six books, and handed them over to his sons and remained on earth thirty days, and was again taken up to heaven on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, on the very day and hour when he was born.</p> 
 <p>4 As every man's nature in this life is dark, so are also his conception, birth, and departure from this life.</p> 
 <p>5 At what hour he was conceived, at that hour he was born, and at that hour too he died.</p> 
 <p>6 Methosalam and his brethren, all the sons of Enoch, made haste, and erected an altar at the place called Achuzan, whence and where Enoch had been taken up to heaven.</p> 
 <p>7 And they took sacrificial oxen and summoned all people and sacrificed the sacrifice before the Lord's face.</p> 
 <p>8 All people, the elders of the people and the whole assembly</p> 
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p> 
 <p>came to the feast and brought gifts to the sons of Enoch.</p> 
 <p>9 And they made a great feast, rejoicing and making merry three days, praising God, who had given them such a sign through Enoch, who had found favour with him, and that they should hand it on to their sons from generation to generation, from age to age.</p> 
 <p>10 Amen.</p>
