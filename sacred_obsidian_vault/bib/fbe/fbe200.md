 </i><p>This Ode has strangely appeared in a speech by Salome in another ancient work called the Pistis Sophia.</p> 
 <p>1 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, because I love thee;<br> 2 O Most High, thou wilt not forsake me, for thou art my hope:<br> 3 Freely I have received thy grace, I shall live thereby:<br> 4 My persecutors will come and not see me:<br> 5 A cloud of darkness shall fall on their eyes; and an air of thick gloom shall darken them:<br> 6 And they shall have no light to see: they may not take hold upon me.<br> 7 Let their counsel become thick darkness, and what I have cunningly devised, let it return upon their own heads:<br> 8 For they have devised a counsel, and it did not succeed:<br> 9 For my hope is upon the Lord, and I will not fear, and because the Lord is my salvation, I will not fear:<br> 10 And He is as a garland on my head and I shall not be moved; even if everything should be shaken, I stand firm;<br> 11 And if all things visible should perish, I shall not die; because the Lord is with me and I am with Him. Hallelujah.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">ODE 6.</h3> <i>
 </i><p>First century universalism is revealed in an interesting way in verse 10.</p> 
 <p>1 As the hand moves over the harp, and the strings speak.<br> 2 So speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak by His love.<br> 3 For it destroys what is foreign, and everything that is bitter:<br> 4 For thus it was from the beginning and will be to the end, that nothing should be His adversary, and nothing should stand up against Him.<br> 5 The Lord has multiplied the knowledge of Himself, and is zealous that these things should be known, which by His grace have been given to us.<br> 6 And the praise of His name He gave us: our spirits praise His holy Spirit.<br> 7 For there went forth a stream and became a river great and broad;<br> 8 For it flooded and broke up everything and it brought (water) to the Temple:<br> 9 And the restrainers of the children of men were not able to restrain it, nor the arts of those whose business it is to restrain waters;<br> 10 For it spread over the face of the whole earth, and filled everything: and all the thirsty upon earth were given to drink of it;<br> 11 And thirst was relieved and quenched: for from the Most High the draught was given.<br> 12 Blessed then are the ministers of that draught who are entrusted with that water of His:<br> 13 They have assuaged the dry lips, and the will that had fainted they have raised up;<br> 14 And souls that were near departing they have caught back from death:<br> 15 And limbs that had fallen they straightened and set up: <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></a><br> 16 They gave strength for their feebleness and light to their eyes:<br> 17 For everyone knew them in the Lord, and they lived by the water of life for ever. Hallelujah.</p>
