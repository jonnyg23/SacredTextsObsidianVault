 </i><p>After Adam's sin God sends him away into the earth 'whence I took thee,' but does not wish to ruin him for all years to come.</p> 
 <p>I SAID to him: 'Earth thou art, and into the earth whence I took thee thou shalt go, and I will not ruin thee, but send thee whence I took thee.</p> 
 <p>2 Then I can again take thee at My second coming!</p> 
 <p>3 And I blessed all my creatures visible and invisible. And Adam was five and half hours in paradise.</p> 
 <p>4 And I blessed the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, on which he rested from all his works.</p>
