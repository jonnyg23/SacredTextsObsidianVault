 <p>1 As the sun is the joy to them that seek for its daybreak, so is my joy the Lord;<br> 2 Because He is my Sun and His rays have lifted me up; and His light hath dispelled all darkness from my face.<br> 3 In Him I have acquired eyes and have seen His holy day:<br> 4 Ears have become mine and I have heard His truth.<br> 5 The thought of knowledge hath been mine, and I have been delighted through Him.<br> 6 The way of error I have left, and have walked towards Him and have received salvation from Him, without grudging. <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></a><br> 7 And according to His bounty He hath given to me, and according to His excellent beauty He hath made me.<br> 8 I have put on incorruption through His name: and have put oft corruption by His grace.<br> 9 Death hath been destroyed before my face: and Sheol hath been abolished by my word:<br> 10 And there hath gone up deathless life in the Lord's land,<br> 11 And it hath been made known to His faithful ones, and hath been given without stint to all those that trust in Him. Hallelujah.</p>
