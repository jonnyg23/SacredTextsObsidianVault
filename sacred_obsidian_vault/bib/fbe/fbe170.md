 </i><p>Of how not to despise the poor, but to share with them equally, lest thou be murmured against before God.</p> 
 <p>WHEN man clothes the naked and fills the hungry, he will find reward from God.</p> 
 <p>2 But if his heart murmur, he commits a double evil: ruin of himself and of that which he gives; and for him there will be no finding of reward on account of that.</p> 
 <p>3 And if his own heart is filled with his food and his own flesh (<i>sc</i>. clothed) with his clothing he commits contempt, and forfeit all his endurance of poverty, and will not find reward of his good deeds.</p> 
 <p>4 Every proud and magniloquent man is hateful to the Lord, and every false speech, clothed in untruth; it will be cut with the blade of the sword of death, and thrown into the fire, and shall burn for all time.'</p>
