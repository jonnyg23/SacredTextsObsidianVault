 </i><p align="CENTER">God's admonition to Adam and Eve in which he points out how and why they sinned.</p> 
 <p>BUT God looked upon them; for they had killed themselves through great grief.</p> 
 <p>2 But He would raise them and comfort them.</p> 
 <p>3 He, therefore, sent His Word unto them; that they should stand and be raised forthwith.</p> 
 <p>4 And the Lord said unto Adam and Eve, "You transgressed of your own free will, until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.</p> 
 <p>5 "Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for divinity, greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I deprived you of the bright nature in which you then were, and I made you come out of the garden to this land, rough and full of trouble.</p> 
 <p>6 "If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law, and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree, near which I told you not to come! And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.</p> 
 <p>7 "But the wicked Satan who continued not in his first estate, nor kept his faith; in whom was no good intent towards Me, and who though I had created him, yet set Me at naught, and sought the Godhead, so that I hurled him down from heaven,--he it is who made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by hearkening to him.</p> 
 <p>8 "Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore have I brought upon you all these sorrows.</p> 
 <p>9 "For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not intend to destroy them. But after they had sorely roused My anger, I punished them with grievous plagues, until they repent.</p> 
 <p>10 "But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their transgression, they shall be under a curse for ever."</p>
