 </i><p>The Odes of Solomon, the Son of David, are ended with the following exquisite verses.</p> 
 <p>1 I stretched out my hands and approached my Lord:<br> 2 For the stretching of my hands is His sign:<br> 3 My expansion is the outspread tree which was set up on the way of the Righteous One.<br> 4 And I became of no account to those who did not take hold of me; and I shall be with those who love me.<br> 5 All my persecutors are dead; and they sought after me who hoped in me, because I was alive:<br> 6 And I rose up and am with them; and I will speak by their mouths.<br> 7 For they have despised those who persecuted them;<br> 8 And I lifted up over them the yoke of my love;<br> 9 Like the arm of the bridegroom over the bride,<br> 10 So was my yoke over those that know me:<br> 11 And as the couch that is spread in the house of the bridegroom and bride,<br> 12 So is my love over those that believe in me. <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></a><br> 13 And I was not rejected though I was reckoned to be so.<br> 14 I did not perish, though they devised it against me.<br> 15 Sheol saw me and was made miserable:<br> 16 Death cast me up, and many along with me.<br> 17 I had gall and bitterness, and I went down with him to the utmost of his depth:<br> 18 And the feet and the head he let go, for they were not able to endure my face:<br> 19 And I made a congregation of living men amongst his dead men, and I spake with them by living lips:<br> 20 Because my word shall not be void:<br> 21 And those who had died ran towards me: and they cried and said, Son of God, have pity on us, and do with us according to thy kindness,<br> 22 And bring us out from the bonds of darkness: and open to us the door by which we shall come out to thee.<br> 23 For we see that our death has not touched thee.<br> 24 Let us also be redeemed with thee: for thou art our Redeemer.<br> 25 And I heard their voice; and my name I sealed upon their heads:<br> 26 For they are free men and they are mine. Hallelujah.</p>
