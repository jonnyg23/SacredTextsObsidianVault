 </i><p align="CENTER">Jerusalem hears a trumpet and stands on tiptoe to see her children returning from the North, East and West.</p> 
 <p>Blow ye in Zion on the trumpet to summon the saints,<br>   Cause ye to be heard in Jerusalem the voice of him that bringeth good tidings; <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a><br>   For God hath had pity on Israel in visiting them.<br> Stand on the height, O Jerusalem, and behold thy children,<br>   From the East and the West, gathered together by the Lord;<br> From the North they come in the gladness of their God,<br>   From the isles afar off God hath gathered them.<br> High mountains hath He abased into a plain for them;<br>   The hills fled at their entrance.<br> The woods gave them shelter as they passed by;<br>   Every sweet-smelling tree God caused to spring up for them,<br>   That Israel might pass by in the visitation of the glory of their God.<br> Put on, O Jerusalem, thy glorious garments;<br>   Make ready thy holy robe;<br>   For God hath spoken good concerning Israel, for ever and ever.<br> Let the Lord do what He hath spoken concerning Israel and Jerusalem;<br>   Let the Lord raise up Israel by His glorious name.</p> 
 <p>The mercy of the Lord be upon Israel for ever and ever.</p>
