 <p align="CENTER">"<i>No cradled child more softly lies than I: come soon, eternity</i>."</p> 
 <p>1 The dew of the Lord in quietness He distilled upon me:<br> 2 And the cloud of peace He caused to rise over my head, which guarded me continually;<br> 3 It was to me for salvation: everything was shaken and they were affrighted;<br> 4 And there came forth from them a smoke and a judgment; and I was keeping quiet in the order of the Lord:<br> 5 More than shelter was He to me, and more than foundation.<br> 6 And I was carried like a child by his mother: and He gave me milk, the dew of the Lord:<br> 7 And I grew great by His bounty, and rested in His perfection,<br> 8 And I spread out my hands in the lifting up of my soul: and I was made right with the Most High, and I was redeemed with Him. Hallelujah.</p>
