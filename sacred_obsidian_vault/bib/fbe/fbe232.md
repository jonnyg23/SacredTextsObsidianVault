 </i><p align="CENTER">A beautiful description of the power of truth.</p> 
 <p>1 I went up to the light of truth as if into a chariot:<br> 2 And the Truth took me and led me: and carried me across pits and gulleys; and from the rocks and the waves it preserved me:<br> 3 And it became to me a haven of Salvation: and set me on the arms of immortal life:<br> 4 And it went with me and made me rest, and suffered me not to wander, because it was the Truth;<br> 5 And I ran no risk, because I walked with Him;<br> 6 And I did not make an error in anything because I obeyed the Truth.<br> 7 For Error flees away from it, and meets it not: but the Truth proceeds in the right path, and<br> 8 Whatever I did not know, it made clear to me, all the poisons of error, and the plagues of death which they think to be sweetness:<br> 9 And I saw the destroyer of destruction, when the bride who is corrupted is adorned: and the <a href="errata.htm#5">bridegroom</a> who corrupts and is corrupted;<br> 10 And I asked the Truth 'Who are these?'; and He said to me, 'This is the deceiver and the error:<br> 11 And they are alike in the beloved and in his bride: and they lead astray and corrupt the whole world:<br> 12 And they invite many to the banquet, <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></a><br> 13 And give them to drink of the wine of their intoxication, and remove their wisdom and knowledge, and so they make them without intelligence;<br> 14 And then they leave them; and then these go about like madmen corrupting: seeing that-they are without heart, nor do they seek for it!<br> 15 And I was made wise so as not to fall into the hands of the deceiver; and I congratulated myself because the Truth went with me,<br> 16 And I was established and lived and was redeemed,<br> 17 And my foundations were laid on the hand of the Lord: because He established me.<br> 18 For He set the root and watered it and fixed it and blessed it; and its fruits are for ever.<br> 19 It struck deep and sprung up and spread out, and was full and enlarged;<br> 20 And the Lord alone was glorified in His planting and in His husbandry: by His care and by the blessing of His lips,<br> 21 By the beautiful planting of His right hand: and by the discovery of His planting, and by the thought of His mind. Hallelujah.</p>
