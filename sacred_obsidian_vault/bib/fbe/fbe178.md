 </i><p>The desecration of Jerusalem; captivity, murder, and raping. A psalm of utter despair.</p> 
 <p>When the sinner waxed proud, with a battering-ram he cast down fortified walls, <a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a><br>   And thou didst not restrain him.<br> Alien nations ascended Thine altar,<br>   They trampled it proudly with their sandals;<br> Because the sons of Jerusalem had defiled the holy things of the Lord,<br>   Had profaned with iniquities the offerings of God.<br> Therefore He said: Cast them far from Me;<br>     .       .       .       .       .       .<br> It was set at naught before God,<br>   It was utterly dishonoured;<br> The sons and the daughters were m grievous captivity,<br>   Sealed was their neck, branded was it among the nations.</p> 
 <p>According to their sins hath He done unto them,<br>   For He hath left them in the hands of them that prevailed.<br> He hath turned away His face from pitying them,<br>   Young and old and their children together;<br> For they had done evil one and all, in not hearkening.<br>   And the heavens were angry,<br> And the earth abhorred them;<br>   For no man upon it had done what they did,<br> And the earth recognized all<br>   Thy righteous judgements, O God.<br> They set the sons of Jerusalem to be mocked at in return for the harlots in her;<br>   Every wayfarer entered in in the full light of day.<br> They made mock with their transgressions, as they themselves were wont to do;<br>   In the full light of day they revealed their iniquities.<br> And the daughters of Jerusalem were defiled in accordance with Thy judgement,<br>   Because they had defiled themselves with unnatural intercourse.<br> I am pained in my bowels and my inward parts for these things.</p> 
 <p>And yet I will justify Thee, O God, in uprightness of heart,<br>   For in Thy judgements is Thy righteousness displayed, O God.<br> For Thou hast rendered to the sinners according to their deeds,<br>   Yea, according to their sins, which were very wicked.<br> Thou hast uncovered their sins, that Thy judgement might be manifest;<br>   Thou hast wiped out their memorial from the earth.<br> God is a righteous judge,<br>   And he is no respecter of persons.</p> 
 <p>For the nations reproached Jerusalem, trampling it down;<br>   Her beauty was dragged down from the throne of glory.<br> She girded on sackcloth instead of comely raiment,<br>   A rope was about her head instead of a crown.<br> She put off the glorious diadem which God had set upon her,<br>   In dishonour was her beauty cast upon the ground.</p> 
 <p>And I saw and entreated the Lord and said,<br>   Long enough, O Lord has Thine hand been heavy on Israel, in bringing the nations upon them.<br> For they have made sport unsparingly in wrath and fierce anger;<br>   And they will make an utter end, unless Thou, O Lord, rebuke them in Thy wrath.<br> For they have done. it not in zeal, but in lust of soul,<br>   Pouring out their wrath upon us with a view to rapine.<br> Delay not, O God, to recompense them on their heads,<br>   To turn the pride of the dragon into dishonour. <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a><br> And I had not long to wait before God showed me the insolent one<br>   Slain on the mountains of Egypt,<br>   Esteemed of less account than the least, on land and sea;<br> His body, too, borne hither and thither on the billows with much insolence,<br>   With none to bury him, because He had rejected him with dishonour.</p> 
 <p>He reflected not that he was man,<br>   And reflected not on the latter end;<br> He said: I will be lord of land and sea;<br>   And he recognized not that it is God who is great,<br>   Mighty in His great strength.<br> He is king over the heavens,<br>   And judgeth kings and kingdoms.<br> It is He who setteth me up in glory,<br>   And bringeth down the proud to eternal destruction in dishonour,<br>   Because they knew Him not.</p> 
 <p>And now behold, ye princes of the earth, the judgement of the Lord,<br>   For a great king and righteous is He, judging all that is under heaven.<br> Bless God, ye that fear the Lord with wisdom,<br>   For the mercy of the Lord will ~e upon them that fear Him, m the Judgement;<br> So that He will distinguish between the righteous and the sinner,<br>   And recompense the sinners for ever according to their deeds;<br> And have mercy on the righteous, delivering him from the affliction of the sinner,<br>   And recompensing the sinner for what he bath done to the righteous.<br> For the Lord is good to them that call upon Him in patience,<br>   Doing according to His mercy to His pious ones,<br>   Establishing them at all times before Him in strength.</p> 
 <p>Blessed be the Lord for ever before His servants.</p>
