 </i><p align="CENTER">A song of hope and fearlessness and peace.</p> 
 <p>Happy is the man whose heart is fixed to call upon the name of the Lord;<br>   When he remembereth the name of the Lord, he will be saved.<br> His ways are made even by the Lord,<br>   And the works of his hands are preserved by the Lord his God.<br> At what he sees in his bad dreams, his soul shall not be troubled;<br>   When he passes through rivers and the tossing of the seas, he shall not be dismayed.<br> He ariseth from his sleep, and blesseth the name of the Lord:<br>   When his heart is at peace, he singeth to the name of his God,<br>   And he entreateth the Lord for all his house.<br> And the Lord heareth the prayer of every one that feareth God,<br>   And every request of the soul that hopes for Him doth the Lord accomplish.</p> 
 <p>Blessed is the Lord, who showeth mercy to those who love Him in sincerity.</p>
