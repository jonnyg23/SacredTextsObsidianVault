 </i><p align="CENTER">Righteousness versus Sin.</p> 
 <p>Why sleepest thou, O my soul,<br>   And blessest not the Lord?<br> Sing a new song,<br>   Unto God who is worthy to be praised.<br> Sing and be wakeful against His awaking,<br>   For good is a psalm sung to God from a glad heart.</p> 
 <p>The righteous remember the Lord at all times,<br>   With thanksgiving and declaration of the righteousness of the Lord's judgements.<br> The righteous despiseth not the chastening of the Lord;<br>   His will is always before the Lord.<br> The righteous stumbleth and holdeth the Lord righteous:<br>   He falleth and looketh out for what God will do to him;<br> He seeketh out whence his deliverance will come.<br>   The steadfastness of the righteous is from God, their deliverer;<br> There lodgeth not in the house of the righteous sin upon sin.<br>   The righteous continually searcheth his house,<br> To remove utterly all iniquity done by him in error.<br>   He maketh atonement for sins of ignorance by fasting and afflicting his soul,<br> And the Lord counteth guiltless every pious man and his house. <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a><br>   The sinner stumbleth and curseth his life<br> The day when he was begotten, and his mother's travail.<br>   He addeth sins to sins, while he liveth;<br> He falleth--verily grievous is his fall--and riseth no more.<br>   The destruction of the sinner is for ever,<br> And he shall not be remembered, when the righteous is visited.<br>   This is the portion of sinners for ever.</p> 
 <p>But they that fear the Lord shall rise to life eternal,<br>   And their life shall be in the light of the Lord, and shall come to an end no more.</p>
