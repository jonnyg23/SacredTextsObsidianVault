 </i><p align="CENTER">The first prophecy of the Resurrection.</p> 
 <p>THEN the Word of God came and said:--</p> 
 <p>2 "O Adam, who counselled thee, when thou earnest out of the cave, to come to this place?"</p> 
 <p>3 And Adam said unto God, "O Lord, we came to this place because of the heat of the fire, that came upon us inside the cave."</p> 
 <p>4 Then the Lord God said</p> 
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a></p> 
 <p>unto Adam, "O Adam, thou dreadest the heat of fire for one night, but how will it be when thou dwellest in hell?</p> 
 <p>5 "Yet, O Adam, fear not, neither say in thy heart that I have spread this rock as an awning over thee, to plague thee therewith.</p> 
 <p>6 "It came from Satan, who had promised thee the Godhead and majesty. It is he who threw down this rock to kill thee under it, and Eve with thee, and thus to prevent you from living upon the earth.</p> 
 <p>7 "But, in mercy for you, just as that rock was falling down upon you, I commanded it to form an awning over you; and the rock under you, to lower itself.</p> 
 <p>8 "And this sign, O Adam, will happen to Me at My coming upon earth: Satan will raise the people of the Jews Jo put Me to death; and they will lay Me in a rock, and seal a large stone upon Me, and I shall remain within that rock three days and three nights.</p> 
 <p>9 "But on the third day I shall rise again, and it shall be salvation to thee, O Adam, and to thy seed, to believe in Me. But, O Adam, I will not bring thee from under this rock until three days and three nights are passed."</p> 
 <p>10 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p> 
 <p>11 But Adam and Eve abode under the rock three days and three nights, as God had told them.</p> 
 <p>12 And God did so to them because they had left their cave and had come to this same place without God's order.</p> 
 <p>13 But, after three days and three nights, God opened the rock and brought them out from under it. Their flesh was dried up, and their eyes and their hearts were troubled from weeping and sorrow.</p>
