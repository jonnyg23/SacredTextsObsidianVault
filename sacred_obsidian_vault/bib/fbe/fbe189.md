 </i><p align="CENTER">Of Solomon. A Psalm. Comfort for the righteous.</p> 
 <p>The right hand of the Lord hath covered me;<br>   The right hand of the Lord hath spared us.<br> The arm of the Lord hath saved us from the sword that passed through,<br>   From famine and the death of sinners.<br> Noisome beasts ran upon them:<br>   With their teeth they tore their flesh,<br>   And with their molars crushed their bones.<br> But from all these things the Lord delivered us. <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a><br> The righteous was troubled on account of his errors,<br>   Lest he should be taken away along with the sinners;<br> For terrible is the overthrow of the sinner;<br>   But not one of all these things toucheth the righteous.<br> For not alike are the chastening of the righteous for sins done in ignorance,<br>   And the overthrow of the sinners.<br> Secretly is the righteous chastened,<br>   Lest the sinner rejoice over the righteous.<br> For He correcteth the righteous as a beloved son.<br>   And his chastisement is as that of a first-born.<br> For the Lord spareth His pious ones,<br>   And blotteth out their errors by His chastening.<br> For the life of the righteous shall be for ever;<br>   But sinners shall be taken away into destruction,,<br>   And their memorial shall be found no more.<br> But upon the pious is the mercy of the Lord,<br>   And upon them that fear Him His mercy.</p>
