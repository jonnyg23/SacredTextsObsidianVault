 </i><p align="CENTER">A song of praise without equal.</p> 
 <p>1 As the honey distills from the comb of the bees,<br> 2 And the milk flows from the woman that loves her children;<br> 3 So also is my hope on Thee, my God.<br> 4 As the fountain gushes out its water,<br> 5 So my heart gushes out the praise of the Lord and my lips utter praise to Him, and my tongue His psalms. <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></a><br> 6 And my face exults with His gladness, and my spirit exults in His love, and my soul shines in Him:<br> 7 And reverence confides in Him; and redemption in Him stands assured:<br> 8 And His inheritance is immortal life, and those who participate in it are incorrupt. Hallelujah.</p>
