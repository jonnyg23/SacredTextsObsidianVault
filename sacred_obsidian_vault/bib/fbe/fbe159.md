 </i><p>God instructs his faithful. how they are to praise his name.</p> 
 <p>BLESSED is the man who opens his lips in praise of God of Sabaoth and praises the Lord with his heart.</p> 
 <p>2 Cursed every man who opens his lips for the bringing into contempt and calumny of his neighbour, because he brings God into contempt.</p> 
 <p>3 Blessed is he who opens his lips blessing and praising God.</p> 
 <p>4 Cursed is he before the Lord all the days of his life, who opens his lips to curse and abuse.</p> 
 <p>5 Blessed is he who blesses all the Lord's works.</p> 
 <p>6 Cursed is he who brings the Lord's creation into contempt.</p> 
 <p>7 Blessed is he who looks down and raises the fallen.</p> 
 <p>8 Cursed is he who looks to and is eager for the destruction of what is not his.</p> 
 <p>9 Blessed is he who keeps the foundations of his fathers made firm from the beginning.</p> 
 <p>10 Cursed is he who perverts the decrees of his forefathers.</p> 
 <p>11 Blessed is he who implants peace and love.</p>
