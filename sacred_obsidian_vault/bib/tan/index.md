 This is a unicode version of the Hebrew Bible.
 To view this properly, you need to have a Unicode font installed which has full
 Unicode Hebrew support.
 For more information, refer to <a href="../../unicode.htm">this page</a>.
 <a href="font.htm">A copyrighted, redistributable
 Hebrew font can be obtained by clicking here.</a>
 We cannot supply any technical support for this font or its use.
 </p>
 <p>
 A transliteration of the Hebrew is provided in parallel.
 This is generated automatically from the Hebrew text.
 The system of transliteration is based on academic conventions for the
 transcription of Hebrew. 
 <a href="../osrc/tanxlit.htm">Documentation on the system of transliteration can be found here</a>.
 Note that this should not be considered a pronunciation guide,
 instead it is a verbatim romanization of the Hebrew text.

 This text is derived from the Westminister Leningrad Codex (WLC)
 of the Westminister Hebrew Institute.
 Thanks to Christopher V. Kimball, who graciously made the
 source files for this freely available.
 This version is based on the October 20th, 2006 WLC release.

 Transcription notes:
 <b>1</b>
 BHS has been faithful to the Leningrad Codex where 
 there might be a question of the validity of the form 
 and we keep the same form as BHS.
 <b>2</b>
 We have added a sop pasuq where L and BHS omit it.
 (The added sof pasuq often is missing from the text.)
 <b>3</b>
 We read or understand L differently than BHS (1983 Edition). 
 this notation indicates a typographical error in BHS.
 <b>4</b>
 Puncta Extraordaria -- 
 a \u05c4 is used to mark such marks in the text
 when they are above the line and
 a \u0323 when they are below the line.
 <b>5</b>
 Large letter(s).
 <b>6</b>
 Small letter(s).
 <b>7</b>
 Suspended letter(s).
 <b>8</b>
 Inverted nun in the text.
 <b>9</b>
 BHS has abandoned L and we concur. 
 All of these occurrences are ketib/qere problems.
 <b>a</b>
 Adaptations to a Qere which L and BHS, by their design, do not indicate.
 <b>m</b>
 Miscellaneous notes to the text and occasions 
 where more than one bracket category applies.
 <b>q</b>
 We have abandoned or added a ketib/qere relative to BHS. 
 In doing this we agree with L against BHS.
 <b>y</b>
 Yathir readings in L which we have designated as Qeres 
 when both Dothan and BHS list a Qere.
