 Because of the substantial amount of hieroglypics interspersed
 in the original text, I have omitted the ### 'glyph' placeholder
 where context permits, for readability.
 Only actual illustations have been inserted into the file.
 Due to space considerations the interlinear translation, which
 is primarily of interest to students of Ancient Egyptian, will not
 be posted.  This should not be a hardship, since the Dover reprint
 edition is still in print and widely available.
 
 <p>The file above, which appears at on the Internet 
 at Sacred-Texts for the <b>first</b> time
 is a faithful e-text of the 1895 edition of the E.A. Wallace
 Budge translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.</p>
 
 <p>In November of 2000 I inventoried my library and found that I was missing
 Budge's Book of the Dead.  So when a copy of the Dover reprint
 came up at the local used bookstore, I purchased it.
 To my dismay, the version of the text widely posted on the
 Internet did not seem to match the Dover reprint of the 1895
 version.</p>
 
 <p>According to John Mark Ockerbloom, the proprietor of the
 excellent
 <a href="https://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/">Online Books Page</a>,
 the version circulating on the Internet is a highly edited
 version of Budge from a much later date (1913).
 He writes:</p>
 
 <cite>
 "I did a little legwork, and it
 appears that the "mystery text" is in fact from the Medici Society
 edition of 1913.  According to a 1960 reprint by University Books,
 for this edition "The translation was rewritten... [and the]
 greater part of the Introduction was also rewritten by Sir Wallis,
 who concluded a preface to it with the pleased words, 'and the entire
 work thus becomes truly a "New Edition"'".  It's unclear whether
 Budge himself did the rewrite of the translation, but it's
 clear that he at least claims responsibility for it,. and it does
 appear to draw fairly heavily on his earlier translation."
 </cite>
 
 <p>
 Thanks to Mr. Ockerbloom for clearing up this mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
 In any case, the version now at sacred-texts is
 a completely new e-text, which I believe to
 be a much better version of this text.
