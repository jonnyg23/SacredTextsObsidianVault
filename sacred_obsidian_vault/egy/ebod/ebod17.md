 <h1 align="CENTER">PLATES V. AND VI.</h1>
 <b></b><p>Vignettes: The funereal procession to the tomb; running the length of the two plates. In the centre of Plate V. the mummy of the dead man is seen lying in a chest or shrine mounted on a boat with runners, which is drawn by oxen. In the boat, at the head and foot of the mummy, are two small models of Nephthys and Isis. By the side kneels Ani's wife Thuthu, lamenting. In front of the boat is the <i>Sem</i> priest burning incense in a censer,[3] and pouring out a libation from a vase; he wears his characteristic dress, a panther's skin. Eight mourners follow. one of whom has his hair whitened. In the rear a sepulchral ark or chest[4] surmounted. by a figure of Anubis and ornamented with emblems of "protection" and "stability," is drawn on a sledge by four attendants, and is followed by two others. By their side walk other attendants carrying Ani's palette, boxes, chair, couch, staff, etc.</p>
 <p>In Plate VI. the procession is continued up to the tomb. In the centre is a</p>

 <p>group of wailing women, followed by attendants carrying on yokes boxes of flowers, vases of unguents, etc. In the right centre are a cow with her calf, chairs of painted wood with flowers upon them, and an attendant with shaven head, carrying a haunch, newly cut, for the funereal feast. The group on the right is performing the last rites. Before the door of the tomb stands the mummy of Ani to receive the final honours; behind him, embracing him, stands Anubis, the god of the tomb; and at his feet, in front, kneels Thuthu to take a last farewell of her husband's body. Before a table of offerings stand two priests: the <i>Sem</i> priest, who wears a panther's skin, holding in his right hand a libation vase, and in his left a censer; and a priest holding in his right hand an instrument[1] with which he is about to touch the mouth and eyes of the mummy, and in his left the instrument for "opening the mouth."[2] Behind or beside them on the ground, in a row, lie the instruments employed in the ceremony of "opening the mouth,"[2] etc., the <i>mesxet</i> instrument, the sepulchral box, the boxes of purification, the bandlet, the libation vases, the ostrich feather and the instruments called <i>Seb-ur</i>, <i>Temanu</i> or <i>Tun-tet</i>, and the <i>Pesh-en-kef</i>. The <i>Kher-heb</i> priest stands behind reading the service of the dead from a papyrus.</p>
 <b></b><p>Appendix: In the papyrus of Hunefer a slab or stele with rounded top is placed by the door of the tomb (Fig. 1, p. 265). In the upper part of it the deceased is shown adoring Osiris, and below is the legend,[3] "Hail, Osiris, the chief of Amenta, the lord of eternity,</p>

May they grant that I may go into and come out from the underworld, that I may follow Osiris in all his festivals at the beginning of the year, that I may receive cakes, and that I may go forth into the presence of [Osiris]; I, the double (<i>ka</i>) of Osiris, the greatly favoured of his god, Hu-nefer." In the upper register of this section of the papyrus is the text of the "Chapter of opening the mouth of the statue of Osiris." The complete scene, including this stele and vignette, appears in the tomb of Pe-ta-Amen-Apt. In the vignette of the first chapter of the Book of the Dead in the papyrus of Neb-qet[1] the soul of the deceased is represented descending the steps of the tomb to carry food to its mummy in the underground chamber (Fig. 2).</p>

 <p>The ceremonies[2] which took place at the door of the tomb in an Egyptian funeral are of considerable interest. The priest called <i>Kher-heb</i>, holding the <i>Sem</i> priest by the arm, gives directions for the slaughter of "a bull of the South." The slaughterer, standing on the bull, cuts off a fore-leg (Fig. 3) and takes out the heart. A woman, called the <i>Tcherauur</i>, who personifies Isis, then whispers in the deceased's ear, "Behold, thy lips are set in order for thee, so that thy mouth may be opened." Next, an antelope[3] and a duck[4]</p>

 <p>are brought by order of the <i>Kher-heb</i>, and their heads are cut off.[1] The <i>Kher-heb</i> then addresses the<i> Sem </i>priest: "I have seized them for thee, I have brought unto thee thine enemies. His hands bring his head [as] his gift. I have slain them for thee, O Tmu; let not his enemies rise up against this god." The slaughterer then presents the thigh to the <i>Kher-heb</i>, and the heart to an official whose title was <i>Smer</i>, and all three then "place the thigh and the heart upon the ground before this god" (<i>i.e.</i>, Osiris). The <i>Kher-heb</i> then says to the deceased, represented by his mummy or statue: I have brought unto thee the thigh (Fig. 4) as the Eye of Horus. I have brought unto thee the heart; let there be no rising up against this god. I have </p>
 <p align="CENTER"><img src="266a.jpg" width="400" height="100"></p>
 <p>brought unto thee the antelope, his head is cut off; I have brought unto thee the duck, his head is cut off." Here the sacrifice ends.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><img src="266b.jpg" width="400" height="135"></p>
 <p>The next part of the ceremony, <i>i.e.</i>, "the opening of the mouth and eyes," is performed by the <i>Sem</i> priest, who addresses the deceased: "I have come to embrace thee, I am thy son Horus, I have pressed thy mouth; I am thy son, I love thee. His mother beats her breast and weeps for him, and those who are in chains with him (<i>i.e.</i>, Isis and Nephthys) beat their breasts. Thy mouth was closed, but I have set in order for</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. The slaughter of the antelope and duck typified the destruction of the enemies of the deceased; for, when Horus destroyed the enemies of his father Osiris, "he cut off their heads [which took] the form of ducks in the sky, making them to fall headlong to the ground in the form of antelopes, and into the water in the form of fishes," For the text, see Schiaparelli,. <i>Il Libro dei Funerali degli Antichi Egiziani</i> (in <i>Atti della R. Accademia dei Lincei</i>; Rome, 1883 and 1890), p. 94; Naville, <i>Todtenbuch</i>, chap. 134.]</p>

 <p>"thee thy mouth[1] and thy teeth." The <i>Kher-heb</i> next calls on the <i>Sem</i> priest four times: "O <i>Sem</i>, take the <i>Seb-ur</i>[2] (Fig. 5) and open the mouth and the eyes"; and while the <i>Sem</i> priest is performing the ceremony the <i>Kher-heb</i> continues: "Thy mouth was closed, but I have set in order for thee thy mouth and thy teeth. I open for thee thy mouth, I open for thee thy two eyes. I have opened for thee thy mouth with the instrument of Anubis. I have opened thy mouth with the instrument of Anubis, with the iron tool with which the mouths of the gods were opened. Horus, open the mouth, Horus, open the mouth. Horus hath opened the mouth of the dead, as he whilom opened the mouth of Osiris, with the iron which came forth from Set, with the iron tool (Fig. 6) with which he opened the mouths of the gods. He hath opened thy mouth with it. The dead shall walk and shall speak, and his body shall [be] with the great company of the gods in the Great House of the Aged one in Annu, and he shall receive there the <i>ureret</i> crown from Horus, the lord of mankind." The <i>Kher-heb</i> next says: "Let the <i>Ami-Khent</i> priest (Fig. 7) stand behind him (<i>i.e.</i>, the deceased), and say, 'My father, my father,' four times." The eldest son of the deceased then stands behind the deceased, and in his </p>

 <p>name the <i>Kher-heb</i> says: "His mother beateth her breast and weepeth for him, and those who are in chains with him also beat their breasts." Another priest, called <i>Am-Khent-Heru</i>, takes up the same position and says: "Isis goeth unto Horus, who embraceth his father." A priestly official belonging to the <i>mesenti</i> class then goes behind the deceased, and the <i>Sem</i>, <i>Smer</i> and <i>Kher-heb</i> priests stand in front, and the <i>Sem</i> priest and the <i>Kher-heb</i>, personifying Horus and Sut, respectively cry: "I am Horus, I am Sut; I will not let thee illumine the head of my father." The <i>Sem</i> priest then leaves the <i>Ka</i>-chapel and returns, leading in the <i>Se-mer-f</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "the son who loveth him"; whereupon the <i>Kher-heb</i> says: "O Sem, let the <i>Se-mer-f</i> come into the tomb in order that he may see the god." The <i>Sem</i> priest holding him by the arm then leads forward the <i>Se-mer-f</i>, who addresses the deceased: "I have come, I have brought</p>

 <p>unto thee thy son who loveth thee; he shall open for thee thy mouth and thine eyes." (Fig. 8). A tomb-official, <i>Am-as</i>, then takes up his position behind the deceased, and the <i>Se-mer-f</i> and the <i>Kher-heb</i> stand in front; the <i>Kher-heb</i> repeating four times: "The <i>Se-mer-f</i> openeth the mouth and the two eyes of the deceased, first with a needle of iron, then with a rod of <i>smu</i> metal"; the <i>Am-as</i> addressing the deceased: "Behold the <i>Se-mer-f</i>"; and the <i>Kher-heb</i> saying, in the name of the <i>Se-mer-f</i>: "I have pressed for thee thy mouth, even as thy father pressed it in the name of Seker. Hail, Horus hath pressed thy mouth for thee, he hath opened thine eyes for thee; Horus hath opened thy mouth for thee, he hath opened for thee thine eyes; they are firmly stablished. Thy mouth was closed; I have ordered thy mouth and thy teeth for thee in their true order. Thou hast [again] opened thy mouth; Horus hath opened thy mouth. I have stablished thy mouth firmly. Horus hath opened for thee thy mouth, Horus hath opened for thee thy two eyes." The <i>Kher-heb</i> then speaks on behalf of the <i>Sem</i> priest: "Thy mouth was closed up. I have ordered aright for thee thy mouth and thy teeth. Thy mouth is firmly stablished. Thy mouth was tightly closed. His mouth is firmly stablished, and [his] two eyes are firmly stablished." The <i>Sem</i> priest next presents to the deceased (Fig. 9) a cone-shaped offering,[2] and at the same time the <i>Kher-heb</i> says: "Open the mouth and the two eyes, open the mouth and the two eyes. Thou hadst tightly closed thy mouth, thou hast [again] opened thy two eyes." Then the <i>Kher-heb</i> says, on behalf of the <i>Smer</i> (Fig. 10) priest who stands behind the deceased:</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><img src="268.jpg" width="500" height="154"></p>
 <p>"One cometh unto thee for thy purification." Next the <i>Se-mer-f</i> comes forward with four boxes (Fig. 11) in his hands, and the <i>Kher-heb</i> says: "O <i>se-mer-f</i>, take the four boxes of purification, press the mouth and the two eyes, and open the mouth and the two eyes with each of them four times, and say, 'Thy mouth and thy two eyes are firmly stablished, and they are restored aright,' and say also, 'I have firmly pressed thy mouth, I have opened thy mouth, I have opened thy two eyes by means of the four boxes of purification."' The <i>Sem</i> priest then approaches</p>

 </font><p>{p. 269}</p>
 <p>the deceased (Fig. 12) with the instrument ###[1], and the <i>Kher-heb</i> at the same time says: "O <i>Sem</i> priest, lay the <i>pesh-en-kef</i> upon his mouth, and say, 'I have stablished for thee thy two jaw-bones in thy face which was divided into two parts.'" The <i>Sem</i> priest next makes an offering of grapes (Fig. 13), the <i>Kher-heb</i> saying: "O <i>Sem</i> priest, place the grapes upon his mouth and say, 'He bringeth to thee the eye of Horus, he graspeth it; do thou also grasp it.'" After an ostrich feather has been offered (Fig. 14) by the <i>Sem</i> priest, and a number of the ceremonies described above have been repeated, and other animals slaughtered, the <i>Kher-heb</i> addresses the <i>Sem</i> priest, and says: "Take the instrument <i>Tun-tet</i>[2] (thrice) and open the mouth and the eyes" (four times). He then continues: "O <i>Sem</i> priest, take the iron instrument of Anubis, <i>Tun-tet</i> (thrice). Open the mouth and the two eyes (four times), and say, 'I open for thee thy mouth with the iron instrument of Anubis with which he opened the mouths of the gods. Horus openeth the mouth, Horus openeth the mouth,</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><img src="269.jpg" width="500" height="166"></p>
 <p>Horus openeth the mouth with the iron which cometh forth from Set, wherewith he hath opened the mouth of Osiris. With the iron tool (<i>meskhet</i>) wherewith he opened the mouths of the gods doth he open the mouth. He [the deceased] shall go in and he shall speak [again], and his body shall dwell with the company of the great gods in Annu, wherein he hath received the <i>ureret</i> crown from Horus, lord of men. Hail, Horus openeth thy mouth and thy two eyes with the instrument <i>Seb-ur</i> or <i>Teman</i>,[3] with the instrument <i>Tun-tet</i> of the Opener of the Roads (<i>i.e.</i>, Anubis) wherewith he opened the mouth of all the gods of the North. Horus the Great[4] cometh to embrace thee. I, thy son who loveth thee, have opened thy mouth and thy two eyes. His mother beateth her breast in grief while she embraceth him, and the two sisters (<i>i.e.</i>, Isis and Nephthys), who are one, strike themselves in grief. All the gods open thy mouth according to the book of the service."' The <i>Kher-heb</i> next instructs the <i>Sem</i> priest to clothe the mummy or statue of the deceased with the <i>nemes</i></p>

The gods were bound therewith; bound round is thy face with it in its name of <i>Hetch</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, light, or brilliance), coming forth from Nekheb. "All that could do harm to thee upon earth is destroyed." The <i>Sem</i> priest, holding a vase of ointment in his left hand, and smearing the mouth with his fore-finger (Fig. 16), says: "I have anointed thy face with ointment, I have anointed thine eyes. I have painted thine eye with <i>uatch</i> and with <i>mestchem</i>. May no ill-luck happen through the dethronement of his two eyes in his body, even as no evil fortune came to Horus through the overthrow of his eye in his body. Thy two eyes are decked therewith in its name of <i>Uatch</i>, which maketh thee to give forth fragrance, in its name of "Sweet-smelling." A number of scented unguents and perfumes are brought forward, and at the presentation of each a short sentence is recited by the <i>Kher-heb</i> having reference to the final triumph of the deceased in the underworld and to the help which the great gods will render to him.</p>

The text is, however, mutilated in places; and the following version has been made by the help of the two copies of the text published by Pleyte, <i>Chapitres Supplémentaires au Livre des Morts</i>, p. 182 ff.; and by Birch, <i>Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.</i>, 1885, p. 84 f.</p>
 <p>[Chapter I<font size="2">B</font>.] " Homage to thee,[1] O thou who livest in Set-Sert of Amenta. Osiris the scribe Nekht-Amen, triumphant, knoweth thy name. Deliver thou him from the worms which are in Re-stau, and which feed upon the bodies of men and drink their blood. Osiris, the favoured one of his divine city, the royal scribe Nekht-Amen, triumphant, is known unto you [ye worms] and he knoweth your names. This is the first bidding of Osiris, the Lord of All, who hath completed all his hidden works: 'Give thou breath [unto them] who fear those who are in the Bight of the Stream of Amenta.' He hath ordered the plans of . . . . . . . . . . . His throne is placed within the darkness, and there is given unto him glory in Re-stau. O god of light, come thou down unto me and swallow up the worms which are in Amenta, The great god who dwelleth within Tattu, whom he seeth not, heareth his prayers. They who are in affliction fear him [the god] who cometh forth with the sentence at the sacred block. Osiris, the royal scribe Nekht-Amen, cometh with the decree of the Lord of All, and Horus hath taken possession of his throne for him. He cometh with tidings; [may he enter in] according to his word and may he see Annu. The nobles have stood up on the ground before him, and the scribes magnify him. The princes bind his swathings, and make festivals for him in Annu. For him hath heaven been led captive; he hath seized the inheritance of the earth in his grasp. Neither heaven nor earth can be taken away from him, for, behold, he is Ra, the first-born of the gods. His mother suckleth him, she giveth her breast from the sky."</p>

 <p>Text: [Chapter XXII.][2] (1) CHAPTER OF GIVING A MOUTH (2) TO OSIRIS ANI, THE SCRIBE AND TELLER OF THE HOLY OFFERINGS OF ALL THE GODS. MAY HE BE VICTORIOUS IN NETER-KHERT! (3) "I rise out of the egg in the hidden land. May my mouth be given (4) unto me that I may speak with it before the great god, the lord of the underworld. (5) May my hand and my arm not be forced back by the holy (6) ministers of any god. I am Osiris, the lord of the mouth of the tomb; and Osiris, the victorious scribe Ani, hath a portion 3 with him (7) who is upon the</p>

 <p>2 The Nebseni papyrus here has a vignette in which the "Guardian of the Balance" is shown touching the mouth of the deceased. In other instances the deceased touches his own mouth.</p>

(8) Homage to thee,[2] O thou lord of brightness, thou who art at the head[3] of the Great House, and who dwellest in night (9) and in thick darkness; I have come unto thee. I am glorious, I am pure; my arms (10) support thee. Thy portion shall be with those who have gone before. O grant unto me my mouth that I may speak (11) therewith; and that I may follow my heart when it passeth through the fire and darkness."[4]</p>
 <p>[<i>Rubric of Chapter</i> LXXII.] (I). If this writing be (2) known [by the deceased] upon earth, and this chapter be done into writing upon [his] coffin, he shall come forth by (3) day in all the forms of existence which he desireth, and he shall enter into [his] place and shall not be rejected. (4) Bread and ale and meat shall be given unto Osiris, the scribe Ani, upon the altar of Osiris. He shall (5) enter into the Fields of Aaru in peace, to learn the bidding of him who dwelleth in Tattu; (6) there shall wheat and barley be given unto him; there shall he flourish as he did upon (7) earth; and he shall do whatsoever pleaseth him, even as [do] the gods who are in the underworld, (8) for everlasting millions of ages, world without end.</p>
 <p>Appendix: The text of Chapter LXXII. does not occur in the Papyrus of Ani. It is given by M. Naville (see <i>Todtenbuch</i>, I., Bl. 84) from, a papyrus in the Louvre. In the vignettes which accompany it, the deceased is represented as adoring three gods, who are either standing in a shrine or are seated upon it. In other instances, the deceased stands by a sepulchral chest or outside a pylon with hands raised in adoration. The following is a translation of the Louvre text:--</p>
 <p>(1) CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY AND OF PASSING THROUGH THE AMMAHET. (2) "Homage to you, O ye lords of <i>kas</i>, ye lords of right and truth, infallible, who shall endure for ever and shall exist through countless ages, grant that (3) 1 may enter into your [presence]. I, even I, am pure and holy, and I have gotten power over the spells which are mine. judgment (4) hath been passed</p>

 <p>upon me in my glorified form. Deliver ye me from the crocodile which is in the place of the lords of right and truth. Grant ye unto me (5) my mouth that I may speak therewith. May offerings be made unto me in your presence, for I know you and I know your names, and I know (6) the name of the great god. Grant ye abundance of food for his nostrils. The god Rekem passeth through the western horizon of heaven. He (7) travelleth on, and I travel on he goeth forth, and I go forth. Let me not be destroyed in the place Mesqet let not the Fiend get the mastery over me; let me not be driven back from your gates; (8) let not your doors be shut against me; for I have [eaten] bread in Pe and I have drunken ale in Tepu. If my arms be fettered in the (9) holy habitation, may my father Tmu stablish for me my mansion in the place above [this] earth where there are wheat and barley in abundance which cannot be told. May feasts be made for me there, for my soul and for my (10) body. Grant me even offerings of the dead, bread, and ale, and wine, oxen, and ducks, linen bandages and incense, wax, and all the good and fair and pure things whereby the gods do live. May I rise again in all the forms which (11) I desire without fail and for ever. May I sail up and down through the fields of Aaru; may I come thither in peace; for I am the double Lion-god."</p>
