 <h1 align="CENTER">FUNERAL CEREMONIES.</h1>
 <p>In illustration of the ceremonies which accompanied the burial of the dead the reader will find extracts from different texts printed in the <i>Appendix</i> on p. 264 ff. To these may be added an extract from the curious ritual which was in vogue in the Vth and VIth dynasties, and which commemorated the ceremonies which were performed for the god Osiris. It is to be noticed how closely the deceased is identified with Osiris, the type of incorruptibility. Osiris takes upon himself "all that is hateful" in the dead : that is, he adopts the burden of his sins; and the dead is purified by the typical sprinkling of water. While the gods are only accompanied by their <i>ka</i>'s, the deceased, in right of his identification with a higher power, is accompanied by his Tet[1] also, that is, by his Osiris.</p>
 <p>Throughout the ceremony, the Eye of Horus,[2] which is represented by various substances, plays a prominent part, for it is that which gives vigour to the heart of the dead and leads him to the god. That portion of the ceremony which was believed to procure the unlocking of the jaws and the opening of the mouth of the deceased, or of the statue which sometimes represented him, was performed after the purification by water and incense had been effected; and hereby was he enabled to partake of the meat and drink offerings, wherein the friends and relatives also participated, in order that they might cement and seal their mystic unity with the dead and with the god with whom he was identified.[3]</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[1. Some fifty years ago, M. Reuvens expressed his belief that the ### represented the four quarters of the world, and according to M. Maspero it unites in itself the four pillars which support the sky and Osiris, whom they preserve from chaos; see <i>Recueil de Travaux</i>, t. xii., p. 79, note 3; and <i>Études de Mythologie</i>, t. ii., p. 359.</p>
 <p>2. On the eyes of Horus, see Lefébure, <i>Le Mythe Osirien--Les Yeux d'Horus</i>, Paris, 1874; and Grébaut, <i>Les deux yeux du Disque Solaire</i> (<i>Recueil de Travaux</i> t. i., pp. 72, 87, 112-131).</p>
 <p>3. To discuss the origin and development of animal sacrifice among the early Egyptians lies outside the scope of this work. For information on the significance of sacrifice among the Semites, in whose customs many originally Egyptian ideas probably survived, see Robertson Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites</i>, p. 294 ff. On the origin of sacrificial acts, see Max Müller, <i>Natural Religion</i>, London, 1889, p. 184; and E. B. Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. ii., p. 340. Whether the Egyptians regarded the sacrifice of bulls, geese, etc., at the tomb as expiatory offerings, can hardly yet be decided.]</p>

 <p>Certain formulae were directed to be repeated four times: a direction which takes us back to the time when the Egyptians first divided the world into four parts, each corresponding to one of the four pillars which held up the sky, that is to say, to one of the four cardinal points, East, South, West, and North, presided over by a special god. The deceased sought to obtain the assistance of each of the four gods of the cardinal points, and to have the right to roam about in his district; hence the formula was repeated four times. Originally four animals or four geese were sacrificed, one to each god, but subsequently East and North, and West and South were paired, and two bulls (or birds) only were sacrificed, one of which was called the Bull of the North,[*] and the other the Bull of the South. The custom of four-fold repetition continued to the Ptolemaïc times[+] and even later.</p>
 <p>The priest whose official title was <i>kher heb</i>, recited the prayers, and the <i>sem</i> or <i>setem</i> priest presented the prescribed offerings. The rubrical directions are given on the margin for the sake of clearness.</p>
 <p>"O Osiris,[++] all that is hateful in Unas hath been brought unto thee,[1] and all the evil words which have been spoken in his name. Come, O Thoth, and take them unto Osiris, bring all the evil words which have been spoken and place them in the hollow of thy hand;[2] thou shalt not escape therefrom, thou shalt not escape therefrom. Whosoever marcheth, marcheth with his <i>ka</i>. Horus marcheth with his <i>ka</i>, Set marcheth with his <i>ka</i>, Thoth marcheth with[3] his <i>ka</i>, Sep marcheth with his <i>ka</i>, Osiris marcheth with his <i>ka</i>, Khent-maati marcheth with his <i>ka</i>; and thy <i>tet</i> shall march with thy <i>ka</i>. Hail, Unas, the hand of thy <i>ka</i> is before thee. Hail, Unas, the hand of thy <i>ka</i> is behind thee. Hail, Unas, the leg of thy <i>ka</i> is before thee. Hail, Unas, the leg of thy <i>ka</i> is behind thee. Osiris Unas, I have given unto thee the Eye of Horus, and thy face is filled therewith, and the perfume thereof spreadeth over thee. The libations which are poured[4] out by thy son, which are poured out by Horus, are for thee, O Osiris, and they are for thee O Unas. I have come, and I have brought unto thee the Eye of Horus that thou mayest refresh thy heart therewith, I have placed it beneath thy feet, and I give unto thee whatsoever hath come forth from thy body that thy heart may not cease to beat through [the want] thereof.[5] Thy voice shall never depart from thee, thy voice shall never depart from thee.</p>

 <p>"[Here is] unguent, [here is] unguent. Open thy mouth, O Unas,[1] and taste the taste of the scent which is in the holy habitations. This scent is that which distilleth from Horus, this scent is that which distilleth from Set, and it is that which stablisheth the hearts of the two Horus gods.[2] Thou purifiest thyself with the Heru-shesu;[*] thou art purified with natron, and Horus is purified with natron; thou art purified with natron, and Set is purified with natron;[3] thou art purified with natron, and Thoth is purified with natron; thou art purified with natron, and Sep is purified with natron; thou art purified with natron, and art established among them, and thy mouth is [as pure] as the mouth of a sucking calf on the day of its birth.

Cause him to gain the mastery over his body, and make his eyes to be opened. May all the shining beings see him, may they hear his name, for the Eye of Horus hath been brought, in order that it may be placed before Osiris Unas.[17] O Osiris Unas, the two Eyes of Horus have been laid like paint upon thy face.[18]</p>
