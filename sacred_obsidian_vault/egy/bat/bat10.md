 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SEVENTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED THEPHET-ASAR.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>THE scene that illustrates the SEVENTH DIVISION of the Tuat, which is passed through by the Sun-god during the SEVENTH HOUR of the Right, is introduced by three lines of text, which read:--</p>
 <p>"The Majesty of this great god taketh up his abode in the Hall of Osiris, and the Majesty of this god</p>
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>
 <p>addresseth words to the Hall of the gods who dwell therein. This god performeth all the rites proper [for entering] this Hall, and he advanceth on his way <a href="errata.htm#0">against</a> Apep by means of the words of power of Isis, and by means of the words of power of the Sovereign God. The name of the gate of this City wherethrough passeth this god is RUTI-ASAR. The name of this City is THEPHET-SHETA. The name of the hour of the night which guideth this great god into it is KHEFTES-HAU-HESQET-[NEHA]-HRA."</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>In the middle register are:--</p>
 <p>1. The boat of Ra, who stands under a canopy formed by the body of the serpent MEHEN; the god is ram-headed and wears a disk on his head, and his name AFU is written twice near him. In front of him stand HEKA-SER and SA, and ISIS, who has both arms stretched out before her, and is reciting the words of power which shall make the boat to advance.</p>
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p>
 <p>Behind the god stand HERU-HEKEN, KA-SHU, NEHES, HU, and the "protector of the boat." Above the boat is written:--"This great god journeyeth in this City in the path of the Circle of SAR (Osiris) by means of the utterances of the words of power of Isis and of the words of power of SER, so that he may journey on his way against NEHA-HRA. If these words of power of Isis, and those of SER be uttered, APEP shall be turned back and shall be shut up in Ament, in the hidden place of the Tuat; if they be uttered on the earth it shall be so likewise. Whosoever shall utter them shall become one of those who are in the boat of Ra, both in heaven and upon earth; but whosoever knoweth not these figures shall not know how to repulse NEHA-HRA."</p>
 <p>2. The serpent NEHA-HRA, which is transfixed to the ground by means of six knives. The goddess SERQET stands with a band round his neck in the act of</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>"He who is in this picture is Apep, and he surroundeth his country, which is in the Tuat; TCHAU is the name of this district, which is four hundred and forty cubits</p>
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>
 <p>in length, and four hundred and forty cubits in breadth, and his voice guideth the gods to him. He who is with (?) him after this great god hath made his passage through this City, halteth (?) with AFU, opposite to the country whereover he would make a way; behold, SERQET is at the head [of Apep], and HER-TESU-F placeth his deadly fetter about his feet after Isis hath taken possession of the words of power of SER of two-fold strength, [and Ra] giveth their it words of power. Whosoever knoweth it (i.e., this picture and the text) upon earth shall not be one of those of whose water NEHA-HRA drinketh."</p>

Whosoever knoweth this [picture] AB-SHAU shall not devour his soul."</p>
