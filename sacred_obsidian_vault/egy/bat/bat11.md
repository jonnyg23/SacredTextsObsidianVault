 <h3 align="CENTER">THE EIGHTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED TEBAT-NETERU-S.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>THE scene that illustrates the EIGHTH DIVISION Of the Tuat, which is passed through by the Sun-god during the EIGHTH HOUR of the night, is introduced by four lines of text which read:--</p>
 <p>"The Majesty of this great god taketh up its place in the Circles of the hidden gods who are on their sand,</p>
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a></p>
 <p>and he addresseth to them words in his boat whilst the gods tow him along through this City by means of the magical powers of the serpent MEHEN. The name of the gate of this City is AHA-AN-URT-NEF. The name of this City is TEBAT-NETERU-S. The name of the Hour of the night which guideth this great god is NEBT-USHA."</p>
 <p>The Circles of this Division are thus described:--</p>
 <p>"The hidden Circles of Ament which are passed through by the great god, his boat being towed along by the gods who dwell in the Tuat; let them be made according to the figures [which are depicted] on the north of the hidden palace in the Tuat. Whosoever knoweth them by their names shall be the possessor of swathings upon earth, and he shall not be repulsed at the hidden gates, and he shall have offerings in very great abundance regularly and perpetually."</p>
 <p>In the middle register are:--</p>
 <p>1. The boat of the sun, in which the god stands</p>
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p>
 <p>under a canopy formed by the body of the serpent Mehen, being towed along by nine gods. His passage is thus described: "This god maketh his way into this City, being towed along by the gods of the Tuat, in his hidden form of MEHEN. This god sendeth forth a cry to the regions</p>
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p>
 <p>of every Circle of this City, and also to the gods who are therein, and it is the voice of them which this god heareth after he hath sent forth a cry to them. The figures of their bodies remain always with their dead bodies which are under their sand, and their gates open to the voice of this god each day, and then they hide themselves after he hath passed by them. Their work in the Tuat is to tow Ra along over the ways of this</p>

We beseech thee to come and to unite thyself, O Ra, to those who tow thee along." The eight gods</p>

 <p>who tow along the boat of Ra are thus described: "These are the gods of the Tuat who tow alone, Ra in the place where the gods have their sepulchres (TEBAT-NETERU-SET), and he is [acclaimed] by those who are in this City. The images secret of TATHENEN, Of Horus (?), [and of] the gods are with them."</p>
 <p>2. Nine large objects somewhat in the form of the hieroglyphic <i>shems</i>, which has the meaning of "follower" or "servant"; unlike this sign, however, each of the nine objects is provided with a huge knife, and from the curved end of each is suspended a human head. M. Maspero is undoubtedly correct in describing these as the servants of the god. The names of the nine servants are:--</p>
 <p>1. HETEP-TA.</p>
 <p>2. AMEN.</p>
 <p>3. SESHETA-BAIU (?).</p>
 <p>4. SEKHEN-KHAIBIT.</p>

 <p>Of these gods it is said:</p>
