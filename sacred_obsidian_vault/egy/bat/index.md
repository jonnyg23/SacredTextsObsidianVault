 <h1 align="CENTER">The Book of Am-Tuat</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">by E. A. Wallis Budge</h2>
 <h4 align="CENTER">[1905]</h4>
 <hr>
 <p>This book is an Ancient Egyptian cosmological
 treatise which describes the Tuat, the underworld
 that the boat of the Sun God, Ra, traverses during the night hours.
 Each chapter deals with one of the twelve hours of the night.
 A hallucinogenic travelogue of the netherworld,
 this extensively illustrated book depicts hundreds of gods and goddesses
 that appear nowhere else in the literature.
