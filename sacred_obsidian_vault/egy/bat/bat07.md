 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FOURTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED ANKHET-KHEPERU</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>IN the scene that illustrates the FOURTH DIVISION of the Tuat, which is passed through by the Sun-god during the FOURTH HOUR Of the night, a region which is entirely different from anything seen previously is entered. We see that the general arrangement which makes each Division to contain three sections has been followed, but the actual path of the Boat of the Sun is different. Instead of passing along the middle section as before, the god is obliged to pass over the region of the kingdom of Seker. The course which was usually passed over by the dead runs from one side of the section to the other diagonally, and it may be thus described:--Starting from the upper side of the topmost division, the corridor, which is called RE-STAU, slants across to the lower side; at the point where it touches the line which divides the first and second section is a door, which is thrown open.</p>
 <p>The door is called MATES-SMA-TA. The corridor runs</p>

 <p>parallel with the line which divides the first and second section for some distance, and is described as the "road of the secret things of Re-stau; the god doth not pass through the leaves of the door, but they hear his voice." A sharp bend takes RE-STAU in a slanting direction across the middle section of the scene, and at the bottom of it is another door, which is called METES-MAU-AT, the corridor runs parallel with the line which divides the second and third section for some distance, when it crosses the section, again in a slanting direction, and at the end of it is a third door, which is called METES-EN-NEHEH. In the second slant of the corridor is an inscription which describes it as the road by which entereth the body of SEKER, who is on his sand, the image which is hidden, and is neither seen nor perceived,</p>
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> As the further course of the corridor will be described under the Fifth Hour we may pass on to consider the Boat of the Sun, and the means by which the god makes his way onward.</p>
 <p>Ra and the gods who formed his crew have left the boat in which they travelled until now, and have betaken themselves to one, each end of which terminates in the head of a serpent. This serpent-boat is drawn along by four gods, who are called TUN-EN-MAA, HER-UARFU, AR-NEFERTU, and SHETAI, Above the boat is written, "[Whilst] this great god journeyeth over those who are in this scene the flames which the mouth of his boat emit guide him through these pools; he seeth not their forms, but he crieth to them and to their places, and they hear his voice,</p>
