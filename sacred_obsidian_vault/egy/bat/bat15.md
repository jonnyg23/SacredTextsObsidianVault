 <img src="img/25700.jpg" align="LEFT">"The Majesty of this great god taketh up his position in this Circle, which is the uttermost limit of thick darkness, and this great god is born in his form of Khepera in this Circle, and Nut and Nu are in this Circle for the birth of this great god when he cometh forth from the Tuat and taketh up his position in the Matet Boat, and when he riseth up from the thighs of Nut. The name of the Gate of this City is THEN-NETERU. The name of this City is KHEPER-KEKIU-KHAU-MESTU. The name of the hour of the night wherein this god cometh into being is MAA-NEFERT-RA."</p>
 <p>Above the whole scene is a line of hieroglyphics, which describes it as:--</p>

 <p>i.e., Khepera, which takes the place of the solar disk that rested on the prow of the boat in the Eleventh Hour.</p>
 <p>The text reads: "This great god in this picture journeyeth along through this City by means of the faithful servants (<i>amkhiu</i>) of this hidden image ANKH-NETERU. His gods draw him along by a cord, and he entereth into his tail and cometh forth from his mouth, and cometh to the birth under the form of Khepera, and the gods who are in his boat [do] likewise. He taketh up his place on the face of the hidden image of the horn (or, forehead) of the sky at the end of the thick darkness, and his hands seal lip the Tuat. Then this great god taketh up his position in the Eastern Horizon of heaven, and Shu receiveth him, and he cometh into being in the East."</p>

They enter into this hidden image of Ankh-neteru in the form of loyal servants, and they come forth in the renewed forms of Ra every day.
