 <p align="center"><i>Utterance
 670</i>.</p>
 
 <p>1972. To say: The double doors of heaven are open; the double doors of the
 bows are open.</p>
 
 <p>1973a. The gods in Buto were filled with compassion, when they came to
 Osiris N.,</p>
 
 <p>1973b. [at the voice of we]eping of Isis and at the lamentation of Nephthys,</p>
 
 <p>1973c. at the wailing of these two spirits</p>
 
 <p>1973d. [for this Great One who comes forth] from the <i>Dȝ.t</i>.</p>
 
 <p>1974a. The Souls of Buto dance for thee;</p>
 
 <p>1974b. they beat their flesh for thee; they hit their arms for thee;</p>
 
 <p>1974c. they dishevel their hair for thee;</p>
 
 <p>1974d. they smite their legs for thee.</p>
 
 <p>1975a. They say to thee, Osiris N., "thou art gone, thou art come;</p>
 
 <p>1975b. thou art asleep, [thou art awake]; thou art [dead (lit. thou
 landest)], thou art alive.</p>
 
 <p>1976a. Stand up, see that which thy son has done for thee;</p>
 
 <p>1976b. awake, hear [that which] Horus [has done for] thee.</p>
 
 <p>1977a. He has beaten for thee him who beats thee, li[ke an ox];</p>
 
 <p>1977b. he has killed for thee him who kills thee, like a wild-bull;</p>
 
 <p>1977c. he has bound for thee him who binds thee;</p>
 
 <p>1977d. he has put him under thy great daughter who is in <i>Ḳdm</i>,</p>
 
 <p>1978a. so that mourning ceased in the two <i>itr.t</i>-palaces of the gods."</p>
 
 <p>1978b. Osiris speaks to Horus:</p>
 
 <p>1978c. After he had exterminated the evil [which was in N. on] his fourth
 day,</p>
 
 <p>1978d. after he had annulled that which he did against him on his eighth
 [day].</p>
 
 <p>1979a. [Thou hast come forth] from the lake of life; [thou art] purified [in
 the lake of] <i>ḳbḥ.w</i>,</p>
 
 <p>1979b. and art become Wepwawet; and thy son Horus conducts thee,</p>
 
 <p>1979c. when he has given to thee the gods, thine enemies, and Thot has
 brought them to thee.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p>
 
 <p>1980a. How beautiful indeed is the sight, how agreeable is the view, the
 sight of Horus,</p>
 
 <p>1980b. in that he gave life to his father, [in that he offered] satisfaction
 to Osiris,</p>
 
 <p>1980c. before the gods of the west!</p>
 
 <p>1981a. Thy libation is poured by Isis,
 [Nephthys has purified thee]--</p>
 
 <p>1981b. [thy two sisters] great and powerful, who collected thy flesh,</p>
 
 <p>1981c. who bound together thy limbs, who made thy two eyes to appear in thy
 face--</p>
 
 <p>11982a. the boat of the evening and the boat of the morning,</p>
 
 <p>1982b. Atum has given to thee, and the Two Enneads have made for thee.</p>
 
 <p>1983a. The children of thy child have raised thee up, perfect--</p>
 
 <p>1983b. <i>Ḥȝpi</i>, <i>Imś.ti</i>, <i>Dwȝ-mu.t-f</i>, <i>Ḳbḥ-śn.w.f</i>,</p>
 
 <p>1983c. who made for thee [their] names [into <i>tt.wi</i>],</p>
 
 <p>1983d. [who washed thy face], [who dried] thy tears,</p>
 
 <p>1983e. who opened thy mouth with their copper (or, iron) fingers.</p>
 
 <p>1984a. Thou mountest, thou mountest towards the broad-hall of Atum;</p>
 
 <p>1984b. thou marchest towards the Marsh of Reeds;</p>
 
 <p>1984c. thou voyagest over the places of the great god.</p>
 
 <p>1985a. To thee heaven is given, to thee the earth is given, to thee the
 Marsh of Reeds is given,</p>
 
 <p>1985b. [by] the two great gods who row thee over-</p>
 
 <p>1985c. Shu and Tefnut, the two great gods of Heliopolis.</p>
 
 <p>1986a. The awakening [of the god], [the rising of the god],</p>
 
 <p>1986b. [for this spirit, who ascends from] the <i>Dȝ.t</i>, (even) Osiris N. who ascends from Geb.</p>
