 <p>1860a. To say: He is assembled: This thy going;</p>
 
 <p>1860b. He is assembled: These thy goings,</p>
 
 <p>1860c. are the goings of Horus in search of his father, Osiris.</p>
 
 <p>1861a. His messengers go; his runners hasten,</p>
 
 <p>1861b. his envoys rush on.</p>
 
 <p>1862a. Hasten to Rē; say to Rē, to him who lifts up his arm in the East,</p>
 
 <p>1862b. that he is coming as a god, that N. stands in the double <i>itr.t</i>-palace of the horizon.</p>
 
 <p>1863a. Thou hearest the words of Rē, as a god, as Horus <i>mśti</i>:</p>
 
 <p>1863b. "I am thy brother, like Sopdu."</p>

 arms--</p>

 <p>1865c. like thy calf, like thy herdsman.</p>
 
 <p>1866a. Thou hast taken these thy white teeth of this <i>mḥn</i>;</p>
 
 <p>1866b. they go around like an arrow, in their name of "Arrow;"</p>
 
 <p>1867a. thy leg of beef is in the nome of Abydos,
 thy (lit. his) piece of meat is in the land of Nubia;</p>
 
 <p>1867b. thou hast descended like the jackal of the South, like Anubis who is
 over (i.e. protects) the (southern) <i>itr.t</i>-palace;</p>
 
 <p>1868a. thou standest before the <i>Rd-wr</i>-lake,</p>
 
 <p>1868b. like Geb, at the head of his Ennead.</p>
 
 <p>1869a. Thou hast thy heart; thou hast thy <i>ka</i>, N.;</p>
 
 <p>1869b. thou furnishest thy house, N.; thou fastenest thy door, N.</p>
