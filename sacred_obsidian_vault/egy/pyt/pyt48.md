 <p>1719c. Rē calls to thee out of the <i>iskn</i>
 of heaven,</p>
 
 <p>1719d. as the jackal (god), nome-governor (of the Bows), the Two Enneads,</p>

 <p>1720b. the heart of the gods rejoice at thy approach,</p>
 
 <p>1720c. as a star which ferries over the ocean which is under the underpart
 of Nut,</p>
 
 <p>1720d. in this, thy dignity issuing from the mouth of Rē.</p>
