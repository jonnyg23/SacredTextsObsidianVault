 <h2 align="CENTER">THE GATE OF TEKA-HRA.</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FIFTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>THE boat of the sun having passed through the Fourth Division of the Tuat arrives at the gateway which leads to the FIFTH DIVISION. This gateway is similar to that which guards the Fourth Division, and is guarded by nine gods, who are described as the "Fourth company;" at the entrance to the corridor and at its exit stands a jackal-headed god, the former being called AAU, and the latter TEKMI, each is said to "extend his arms and hands to Ra." The corridor is swept by flames of fire, as before. The gateway is called ARIT, and the text says, "This great god cometh to this gateway, and entereth in through it, and the gods who are therein acclaim him," The nine gods say to</p>
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Ra, "RA-HERU-KHUTI unfoldeth our doors, and openeth our gateways. Hail, Ra, come thou to us, O great god, lord of hidden nature." The monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards the gateway is called TEKA-HRA, and the two lines of text which refer to his admission of Ra read:--"He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA saith to TEKA-HRA:--'Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy doors to KHUTI, that he may send light into the thick darkness, and may make his radiance illumine the hidden habitation.' This door is shut after the great god hath passed through it, and there is lamentation to those who are in this gateway when they hear this door close upon them." As the hieroglyphic text is identical with that given above on <a href="gate19.htm#page_120">p. 120</a> it is not repeated here.</p>
 <p>In the middle of this Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before, and stands in a shrine enveloped by MEHEN. SA stands in the bows, and HEKA at the stern. In front of those who tow the boat are nine shrouded gods, with projecting elbows; each of these holds in his hands a part of the body of a long, slender serpent, and the group is called "those who hold ENNUTCHI." In front of these are</p>

 <p>twelve bearded beings, who are advancing towards a god, who is styled [the god] "of his angle;" the twelve gods are described as BAIU RETH-AMMU-TUAT, i.e., "the souls of the men who are in the Tuat," The texts read:--</p>

 <p>"The gods of the Tuat draw along this great god, and he journeyeth through the hidden place. [Ra saith:--] 'Draw ye me along, O ye gods of the Tuat, and sing praises unto me, O ye who are at the head of the stars; let your cords be strong (or, vigorous), and draw ye me along by means of them, and let your hands and arms be steady, let there be speed in your legs, let there be strong intent in our souls, and let your hearts be glad. Open ye a prosperous way into the chambers (<i>qerti</i>) of hidden things."'</p>

 <p>The text relating to the bearers of the serpent reads:--</p>
 <p>"Those who are in this scene carry this serpent. Ra striketh them and advanceth towards them to make himself to rest in [the gateway called] NEBT-AHAU. This serpent travelleth as far as it (i.e., this (gateway), but he passeth not beyond it. Ra saith unto them:--'Strike ye the serpent ENNUTCHI there, give him no way [whereby to escape], so that I may pass by you. Hide your arms, destroy that which</p>
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p>
 <p>you guard, protect that which cometh into being from my forms, and tie ye up (or, fetter) that which cometh into being from my strength.' Their food consisteth of the hearing of the word of this god, and offerings are made to them from the hearing of the word of Ra in the Tuat."</p>
 <p>"Unto those who have spoken what is right and true upon earth, and who have magnified the forms of the god, Ra saith:--'Praises shall be [sung] to</p>

The habitations which shall be yours shall be (or, are) at the corner where [live] those who are with me who weigh words for them.' Their food is of bread-cakes, and their drink of tchesert drink, and their libations are of cool water. Offerings are made unto them upon earth as to the</p>

 <p>Ra saith unto this god:--"Let him that is over his Corner (HERI-QENBET-F) cry out to those souls who are right, and true, and divine, and make them to sit at peace in their habitations at the Corner of those who are with myself."</p>
 <p>On the right hand of the path of Ra in the Fifth Division of the Tuat are:--1. Twelve male beings bowing in adoration; they are described as "those who make adorations in the Tuat." 2. Twelve male beings who bear in their hands a cord for measuring plots of ground and estates; these are called "Holders of the cord in the Tuat." Four gods, standing upright, each holding the symbol of life in his right hand, and a sceptre in the left.</p>

 <p>The passage in the text which refers to the adorers reads:--</p>
 <p>"[These are] they who make songs to Ra in Amentet and exalt Heru-khuti. [These are they who] knew Ra upon earth, and who made offerings unto him. Their offerings are in their place, and their glory</p>
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>
 <p>is in the holy place of Ament. They say unto Ra:--'Come thou, O Ra, progress through the Tuat. Praise be to thee! Enter thou among the holy [places] with the serpent Mehen.' Ra saith unto them:--'There are offerings for you, O ye who made offerings. I am content with what ye did for me, both when I used to shine in the eastern part of heaven, and when I was sinking to rest in the chamber of my Eye.' Their food is of the bread-cakes</p>

 <p>The passage in the text which refers to the holders of the measuring cord reads:--</p>
 <p>"[These are they who] hold the measuring cord in Ament, and they go over therewith the fields of the KHU (i.e., the beatified spirits). [Ra saith to</p>
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p>
 <p>them]:--'Take ye the cord, draw it tight, and mark out the limit (or, passage) of the fields of Amentet, the KHU whereof are in your abodes, and the gods whereof are on your thrones.' The KHU of NETERTI are in the Field of Peace, [and] each KHU hath been judged by him that is in the cord. Righteousness is to those who are (i.e., who exist), and unrighteousness to those who are not. Ra saith unto them:--'What is right is the cord in Ament, and Ra is content with the stretching (or, drawing) of the same. Your possessions are yours, O ye gods, your homesteads are yours, O ye KHU. Behold ye, Ra maketh (or, worketh) your fields, and he commandeth on your behalf that there may be sand (?) with you."</p>

 <p>"Hail, journey on, O KHUTI, for verily the gods are content with that which they possess, and the KHU are content with their homesteads. Their food [cometh] from Sekhet-Aru, and their offerings from that which springeth up therein. Offerings are made unto them upon earth from the estate of Sekhet-Aru."</p>
 <p>To the four bearded gods Ra saith:--"Holy are ye, O HENBI gods, ye overseers of the cords in Amentet. [O stablish ye fields and give [them] to the gods and to the KHU (i.e., spirits) [after] they have been</p>
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>
 <p>measured in Sekhet-Aaru. Let them give fields and sand to the gods and to the souls who are in the Tuat. Their food shall be from Sekhet-Aaru, and their offerings from the things which spring forth therein]."</p>
 <p>On the left of the path of the boat of Ra are:--1. A hawk-headed god, leaning upon a staff; he is called Horus. 2. Four groups, each group containing four men. The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third axe NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians, the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races and NEGROES, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned Libyans. 3. Twelve bearded beings, each of whom grasps with both hands the body of a long serpent; these are called the "Holders of the period of time in Ament." 4. Eight bearded gods, who are called the "Sovereign chiefs of the Tuat." The hieroglyphic text which relates to these groups reads:--</p>

 <p>The passage which refers to the four groups, each containing four men, reads:--</p>
 <p>Horus saith unto the creatures of Ra who dwell in the Black Land (Qemt, i.e., Egypt) and in the Red Land (i.e., the deserts which lie on each side of the Black Land formed of the mud of the Nile):--"Magical protection be unto you, O ye creatures of Ra, who have come into being from the Great One who is at the head of heaven! Let there be breath to your nostrils, and let your linen swathings be unloosed! Ye are the tears <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">1</font></a> of the eye of my splendour in your name of RETH (i.e., men). Mighty of issue (AA-MU) ye have come into being in your name of AAMU; Sekhet hath created them, and it is she who delivereth (or, avengeth) their souls. I masturbated [to produce you], and I was content with the hundreds of thousands [of beings] who came forth from me in your</p>

 <p>The passage which refers to the gods who make stable the period of life (KHERU-AHAU-EM-AMENT) reads:--</p>
 <p>Those who make firm (or, permanent) the duration</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>of life stablish the days of the souls [in] Amenti and possess the word (or, command) of the place of destruction. Ra saith unto them:--"Inasmuch as ye are the gods who dwell in the Tuat, and who have possession of [the serpent] METERUI, by means of whom ye mete out the duration of life of the souls who are in Amenti who are condemned to destruction, destroy ye the souls of the enemies according</p>
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>
 <p>to the place of destruction which ye are commanded to appoint, and let them not see the hidden place."</p>

 <p>"[Here are] the divine sovereign chiefs who shall destroy the enemies. They shall have their offerings</p>

The destruction which is yours shall be [directed] against the enemies, and the power to write</p>
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p>
 <p>which ye possess shall be for the place of destruction. I have come, even I the great one Horus, that I may make a reckoning with my body, and that I may shoot forth evils against my enemies. Their food is bread, and their drink is the <i>tchesert</i> wine, and they have cool water wherewith to refresh (or, bathe) themselves. [Offerings are made to them upon earth. One doth not enter into the place of destruction.] <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
