 <p>And again when they would denote a <i>sacred scribe,</i> or a <i>prophet</i>, or an <i>embalmer</i>, or the <i>spleen</i>, or <i>smelling</i>, or <i>laughter</i>, or <i>sneezing</i>, [or <i>government</i>, or a <i>judge</i>,] they depict a DOG.

 <p>fawning upon no one, like dogs. And they symbolise by it a <i>prophet</i>, because the dog gazes intently <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">1</font></a> upon the images of the gods more than all other animals, as does a prophet. And an <i>embalmer</i> of the sacred animals, because he also surveys the naked and dissected forms which are preserved by him. And the <i>spleen</i>, because this animal alone of all other creatures has this organ very light: and whether death or madness seizes him it arises from his spleen. And those who attend this animal in his exequies, when about themselves to die, generally become splenetic; for smelling the exhalations from the dog, when dissecting him, they are affected by them.</p>

 <p>And it denotes smelling, and laughter, and sneezing, because the thoroughly splenetic are neither able to smell, nor laugh, nor sneeze.</p>
