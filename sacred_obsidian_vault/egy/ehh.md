 This is a three volume collection of texts and commentary about the
 Ancient Egyptian alternate reality called the Tuat.
 The Tuat was both the region that the boat of the Sun God Ra
 traversed during the night, and the place where inhabitants of this
 world went after death.
 A description of the Tuat, and its inhabitants and portals, was inscribed
 on the walls of the tombs of all social strata.
