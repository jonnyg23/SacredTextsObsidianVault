 <p>(1) To heal ophthalmia (?) in a man. '[Ho?] Amon, this lofty male, this male of Ethiopia, who came down (2) from Meroe to Egypt, he finds my son Horus betaking himself as fast as his feet move (?), and he injured (?) him (3) in his head with three spells in Ethiopian language, and he finds N. son of N. and carries him as fast as his feet move(?), (4) and injures his head with three spells in Ethiopian language: Gentini, Tentina, (5) Kwkwby, [Ak]khe, Akha.' (6) (Say it) to a little oil; add salt and nasturtium seed to it, you anoint the man who has ophthalmia (?) with it. (7) You also write this on a new papyrus; you make it into a written amulet on his body:--'Thou art this eye of heaven' in the writings (followed by an eye with rays, as drawn in the papyrus).</p>
