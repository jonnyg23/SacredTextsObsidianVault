 <h3 align="CENTER">THE TWENTIETH CEREMONY.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>After the presentation of the wine and beer the SEM priest took in his hands a small table, or stand, on which were placed several bread-cakes of different shapes and kinds, called "Tchesert," i.e., "the</p>

 <p>holy table." With this he advanced to the deceased, and whilst he offered it to him the Kher heb said:--</p>
 <p>"O Ra, may the worship which thou hast in heaven and all the worship which is offered to thee be to Unas, and may everything which is offered to thy body be offered to the KA of Unas; and may everything which is offered to his body be thine."</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>From this passage we learn that the deceased is identified with Ra, and that it was expected that he would share with Ra the praises, and worship, and offerings which were dedicated to him. The offerings made to the deceased were intended for Ra, upon whom devolved the duty of feeding him with a portion of them. The bread-cakes of earth were transmuted into the "bread of everlastingness," and the wine into the "wine of eternity," whereon Ra lived.</p>
