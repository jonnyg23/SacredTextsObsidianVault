 <h1 align="CENTER">The Euahlayi Tribe</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">By K. Langloh Parker</h2>
 <h4 align="CENTER">1905</h4>
 <hr>
 <p>
 This is an effort by K. Langloh Parker to describe in formal terms
 her understanding of Euahlayi society.
 The resulting ethnography is factual and well written.
 Parker was obviously also familiar with the anthropological literature.
 She was hardly the detached observer that modern ethnography demands,
 however, at that time this methodology had not been invented yet.
 This is not necessarily a bad thing.
 As Andrew Lang points out in the introduction, she lived in close contact
 with aborigines for many years, and as a female she had access to the
 women of the tribe, a viewpoint for which we have no other source from that
 time period.
