 <p align="center">PREFACE.</p>  
 <p>Origin and consequences of superstition.</p>  
 <p>Causes that have led the author to write.</p>  
 <p>Course of his investigation.</p>  
 <p>For what readers the treatise is designed. Submission of author to the rulers of his country.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER I—Of Prophecy.</p>  
 <p>Definition of prophecy.</p>  
 <p>Distinction between revelation to Moses and to the other prophets.</p>  
 <p>Between Christ and other recipients of revelation.</p>  
 <p>Ambiguity of the word "Spirit."</p>  
 <p>The different senses in which things may be referred to God.</p>  
 <p>Different senses of "Spirit of God."</p>  
 <p>Prophets perceived revelation by imagination.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER II—Of Prophets.</p>  
 <p>A mistake to suppose that prophecy can give knowledge of phenomena</p>  
 <p>Certainty of prophecy based on: (1) Vividness of imagination, (2) A Sign, (3) Goodness of the Prophet.</p>  
 <p>Variation of prophecy with the temperament and opinions of the individual.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER III—Of the Vocation of the Hebrews, and whether the Gift of Prophecy was peculiar to them.</p>  
 <p>Happiness of Hebrews did not consist in the inferiority of the Gentile.</p>  
 <p>Nor in philosophic knowledge or virtue.</p>  
 <p>But in their conduct of affairs of state and escape from political dangers.</p>  
 <p>Even this Distinction did not exist in the time of Abraham.</p>  
 <p>Testimony from the Old Testament itself to the share of the Gentiles in the law and favour of God.</p>  
 <p>Explanation of apparent discrepancy of the Epistle to the Romans.</p>  
 <p>Answer to the arguments for the eternal election of the Jews.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER IV—Of the Divine Law.</p>  
 <p>Laws either depend on natural necessity or on human decree. The existence of the latter not inconsistent with the former class of laws.</p>  
 <p>Divine law a kind of law founded on human decree: called Divine from its object.</p>  
 <p>Divine law: (1) universal; (2) independent of the truth of any historical narrative; (3) independent of rites and ceremonies; (4) its own reward.</p>  
 <p>Reason does not present God as a law-giver for men.</p>  
 <p>Such a conception a proof of ignorance—in Adam—in the Israelites—in Christians.</p>  
 <p>Testimony of the Scriptures in favour of reason and the rational view of the Divine.</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER V.—Of the Ceremonial Law.</p>  
 <p>Ceremonial law of the Old Testament no part of the Divine universal law, but partial and temporary. Testimony of the prophets themselves to this Testimony of the New Testament.</p>  
 <p>How the ceremonial law tended to preserve the Hebrew kingdom.</p>  
 <p>Christian rites on a similar footing.</p>  
 <p>What part of the Scripture narratives is one bound to believe?</p>  
 <p>Authors Endnotes to the Treatise.</p>
