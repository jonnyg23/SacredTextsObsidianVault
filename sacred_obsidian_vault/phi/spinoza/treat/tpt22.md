 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>A Theologico-Political Treatise</i>, by Benedict de Spinoza, [1883], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h4 align="center">AUTHOR'S ENDNOTES TO THE THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE</h4>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XI.</p>  
 <p>Endnote 24. (1) "Now I think." (2) The translators render the [Greek] word "I infer", and assert that Paul uses it as synonymous with [a Greek word]. (3) But the former word has, in Greek, the same meaning as the Hebrew word rendered to think, to esteem, to judge. (4) And this signification would be in entire agreement with the Syriac translation. (5) This Syriac translation (if it be a translation, which is very doubtful, for we know neither the time of its appearance, nor the translators and Syriac was the vernacular of the Apostles) renders the text before us in a way well explained by Tremellius as "we think, therefore."</p>  
 <p align="center">CHAPTER XV.</p>  
 <p>Endnote 25. (1) "That simple obedience is the path of salvation." (2) In other words, it is enough for salvation or blessedness, that we should embrace the Divine decrees as laws or commands; there is no need to conceive them as eternal truths. (3) This can be taught us by Revelation, not Reason, as appears from the demonstrations given in Chapter IV.</p>
