 <h1 align="CENTER">67. OF THORGEIR STARKAD'S SON</h1>
 <p>Sometime after Thorgeir Starkad's son fared to Kirkby to see his namesake, and they went aside to speak, and talked secretly all day; but at the end Thorgeir Starkad's son gave his namesake a spear inlaid with gold, and rode home afterwards; they made the greatest friendship the one with the other.</p>
 <p>At the Thingskala-Thing in the autumn, Kolskegg laid claim to the land at Moeidsknoll, but Gunnar took witness, and offered ready money, or another piece of land at a lawful price to those under the Threecorner.</p>
 <p>Thorgeir took witness also, that Gunnar was breaking the settlement made between them.</p>
 <p>After that the Thing was broken up, and so the next year wore away.</p>
 <p>Those namesakes were always meeting, and there was the greatest friendship between them. Kolskegg spoke to Gunnar and said, "I am told that there is great friendship between those namesakes, and it is the talk of many men that they will prove untrue, and I would that thou wouldst be ware of thyself."</p>
 <p>"Death will come to me when it will come," says Gunnar, "wherever I may be, if that is my fate."</p>
 <p>Then they left off talking about it.</p>
 <p>About autumn, Gunnar gave out that they would work one week there at home, and the next down in the isles, and so make an end of their hay-making. At the same time, he let it be known that every man would have to leave the house, save himself and the women.</p>
 <p>Thorgeir under Threecorner goes to see his namesake, but as soon as they met they began to talk after their wont, and Thorgeir Starkad's son, said, "I would that we could harden our hearts and fall on Gunnar."</p>
 <p>"Well," says Thorgeir Otkell's son, "every struggle with Gunnar has had but one end, that few have gained the day; besides, methinks it sounds ill to be called a peace-breaker."</p>
 <p>"They have broken the peace, not we," says Thorgeir Starkad's son. "Gunnar took away from thee thy cornfield; and he has taken Moeidsknoll from my father and me."</p>
 <p>And so they settle it between them to fall on Gunnar; and then Thorgeir said that Gunnar would be all alone at home in a few nights' space, "and then thou shalt come to meet me with eleven men, but I will have as many."</p>
 <p>After that Thorgeir rode home.</p>
