 <p align="center">KING EYSTEIN'S WESTERN VOYAGE</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         After that king Eystein
 began his voyage out of the land west across the sea, and sailed to
 Caithness.  He heard that earl Harold Maddad's son was in Thurso.  He
 ran in with three small cutters, and came upon them unawares.  But the
 earl had a ship of thirty benches and eighty men aboard her.  But as they
 were unready, then king Eystein and his men were able to board the ship at
 once, and they took the earl prisoner, and carried him off to their
 ships.  He ransomed himself with three marks of gold.  And they
 parted as things stood.  So says Einar Skuli's son.</p>
 
 <p>         "Eighty men by
 Maddad's son</p>
 
 <p>         Stood while Sogn's king
 came on;</p>
 
 <p>         The glory of the ocean lord</p>
 
 <p>         That sates the sea mew
 blazed abroad:</p>
 
 <p>         With cutters three the
 prince that teazes</p>
 
 <p>         Sea Horses (2) the proud
 earl seizes;</p>
 
 <p>         He that erns hath often
 fed,</p>
 
 <p>         Gave back to noble chief
 his head."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         King Eystein sailed thence
 south along the coast of Scotland, and came off that town in Scotland which is
 called Aberdeen, and slew there many men, and plundered the town.  So says
 Einar Skuli's son.</p>
 
 <p>         "I have heard that
 prince so keen</p>
 
 <p>         Wasted peace at Aberdeen;</p>
 
 <p>         There before him warriors
 fell,</p>
 
 <p>         And swords were shivered,
 as they tell."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         Another battle he had south
 at Hartlepool with a band of horsemen, and he put them to flight, and cleared
 there the decks of some ships.  So says Einar.</p>
 
 <p>         "The king's blade bit
 well,</p>
 
 <p>         On spear point blood fell,</p>
 
 <p>         His comrades stood cool,</p>
 
 <p>         Before Hartle-pool:</p>
 
 <p>         Hot rivers of blood</p>
 
 <p>         Gladdened ravens so good,</p>
 
 <p>         And wolf's wine (3) rose
 red,</p>
 
 <p>         As the English ships
 fled."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         Then he held on south to
 England, and had a third battle at Whitby, and got the victory, but burnt the
 town.  So says Einar.</p>
 
 <p>         "The hero waged war,</p>
 
 <p>         Swords sung from afar,</p>
 
 <p>         And war clouds (4) were
 cleft,</p>
 
 <p>         Ere Whitby was left:</p>
 
 <p>         Over roof trees the hound</p>
 
 <p>         Of the pine-wood (5) did
 bound;</p>
 
 <p>         And wolves' fangs were red</p>
 
 <p>         As folk in fear fled."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         After that he harried far
 and wide in England.  Stephen was then king in England.  Next after
 that king Eystein had a battle at Skarp-skerry with some knights.  So says
 Einar.</p>
 
 <p>         "By Skerry of Scarp,</p>
 
 <p>         While string-rain (6) flew
 sharp,</p>
 
 <p>         The king fought his way</p>
 
 <p>         Through a shielded array."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         Then next he fought at
 Pilawick, and got the victory.  So says Einar.</p>
 
 <p>         "The chief dyed his
 sword</p>
 
 <p>         In Pila-wick's firth,</p>
 
 <p>         While Odin's grim horde (7)</p>
 
 <p>         Tore tall corses from
 Perth:</p>
 
 <p>         West o'er the sea waves</p>
 
 <p>         On foreheads brand crashes,</p>
 
 <p>         When Langton the king takes</p>
 
 <p>         And lays it in ashes."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         There they burnt Langton, a
 great thorpe;  and men says that town has raised its head little
 since.  After that king Eystein fared away from England, and in the autumn
 back to Norway.  And men spoke of this voyage in very different ways.</p>
