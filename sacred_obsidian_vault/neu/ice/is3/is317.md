 <p align="center">THE FOREIGN VOYAGE OF ERLING
 WRY-NECK.</p>
 
 <p>         Erling hight the son of
 Kyrping-Worm and Ragnhilda the daughter of Sveinki Steinar's son. 
 Kyrping-Worm was a son of Sweyn, Sweyn's son, Erlend's son of Gerdi.  The
 mother of Worm was Ragna a daughter of earl Worm Eilif's son, and Ingibjorg the
 daughter of earl Finn Arni's son.  The mother of earl Worm was Ragnhilda a
 daughter of earl Hacon the mighty.  Erling was a wise man and a great
 friend of king Ingi, and with his advice Erling got to wife Christine the
 daughter of king Sigurd and queen Malmfrid.  Erling had his home at Studla
 in South Hordeland.  Erling fared out of the land and with him Eindrid the
 young and many more liegemen still;  they had picked crews.  They
 busked them to fare to Jewry and fared west across the sea to the
 Orkneys.  The leader of that voyage was earl Rognvald-Kali and along with
 him bishop William.  And they had in all out of the Orkneys fifteen
 ships.  First they sailed to the Southern isles (sic.) and thence west to
 France;  and afterwards by that way which king Sigurd Jewry-farer had
 fared out to Nörva-Sound, and they harried far and wide in heathen Spain. 
 A little after they had sailed through the Sound Eindrid the young parted from
 them, and those who followed him, with six ships, and they fared to
 Micklegarth.  But earl Rognvald and Erling and their men fell on a Dromond
 alone on the sea, and ran up to her with nine ships and fought against
 them.  But at last they ran their war-snakes under the Dromond;  then
 the heathen men hurled down on them weapons and stones and pots full of boiling
 pitch and oil.  Erling lay with his ship nearest in under the Dromond, and
 the shower of weapons of the heathen fell beyond that ship.  Erling and
 his men hewed holes in the Dromond, some below under water, some up on the
 sides, so that they got in there.  So says Thorbjorn Wrynick-Skald in
 Erling's Dirge.</p>
 
 <p>         "Fearless then the
 Northmen bold</p>
 
 <p>         Hewed with axe-edge gaps in
 hold;</p>
 
 <p>         That was daring! 
 while the wights</p>
 
 <p>         Who sate the eagles (1) saw
 strange sights,</p>
 
 <p>         As they gazed down on each
 stroke</p>
 
 <p>         That fell on iron binding
 oak;</p>
 
 <p>         Till the skimmer of the
 seas</p>
 
 <p>         Felt the shock in all her
 knees."</p>
 
 <p>Audun the red was the name of that man, Erling's bowman, who first boarded
 the Dromond.  They won the Dromond, and slew there countless men;  and
 took very much goods;  and won a splendid victory.  Earl Rognvald and
 Erling, who was afterwards called "wry-neck," came in that voyage to
 Jewry-land, and out as far as the river Jordan.  Then they turned back
 from abroad across the sea, and fared to Micklegarth.  There they left
 their ships.  They fared from abroad the landway, and held on safe and
 sound till they came to Norway.  And their voyage was very much
 praised.  Erling was thought afterwards a much greater man than before, both
 for his journey and for his wedding.  He was a sage in wit, wealthy, and
 great in his kinsmen, and a good speaker;  he leant most in all friendship
 to king Ingi of all those brothers.</p>
