 <h2 align="center">THE OATH OF TRUCE<br> <small>[TRYGGTHAMÓL]</small></h2>
 
 <p>P<small>RIMITIVE</small> law, based as it is on the profoundest ethical convictions and sentiments of the race, has many elements in common with poetry. Especially is this the case when the law seeks to instance, or motivate, or elaborate, sanctions or punishments. Thus we find embedded in the Icelandic laws, following a treatment of weregild or composition for manslaughter, etc., a formula of peace<a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> which both in form and spirit is essentially poetic. Indeed, when passion infuses itself—as where a mighty curse is called down on the violator of these oaths—heights of truly great poetry are reached: for the benefit of both witnesses and the interested parties, the abstract “everywhere” in which outlawry will be visited on him is translated into concrete images which pass before the mind’s eye in an artless series of vivid impressions from the life of man, the boundless earth, the sky and the sea.</p>
 
 <p> Like other, similar, snatches in the laws, the <i>Tryggthamól</i> are most instructive to the student of Old Germanic poetry in showing a more primitive stage of alliterative verse than that seen in epic or lay. There is as yet no regularity of metrical line, though a few normal long-lines do occur;<a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> far less, any strophic structure. Still, alliteration has here its basic function of marking and reinforcing the natural stress, variation (parallelism) shows the instinctive fondness of the race for dwelling on favorite objects or conceptions; and the occasionally magnificent rhythm anticipates the effects of the more regular art practice to come. In other words, there are here, as in embryo, all the peculiar and stirring elements of Old Germanic poetry.</p>
 
 <p> It is reasonable to suppose that these oaths are age-old and were brought over to Iceland from the common home in

 Norway.<a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#note_3"><font size="1">3</font></a> Certainly the groundstock is heathen; the references to Christian belief and practices are but natural later accretions.</p>
 
 <p> The version here translated is that of the so-called <i>Konungabók</i> or “Kings’ Book” MS of the <i>Grágás</i>,<a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#note_4"><font size="1">4</font></a> a twelfth-century compilation of Icelandic laws. A shorter version exists also in the so-called <i>Statharhólsbók,</i> or “Book of Statharhól Bishopric” MS of the <i>Grágás</i>. Besides, we have versions with important divergences in the seventy-second chapter of the <i>Grettis saga</i> and the thirty-third chapter of the <i>Heitharvíga saga</i>.</p>
