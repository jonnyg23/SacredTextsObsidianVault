 <h2 align="center">HILDIBRAND’S DEATH SONG</h2>
 
 <p>T<small>HIS FINE</small> fragment is an offshoot of the South Germanic, and ultimately Gothic, heroic motif best known to us from the famous old German lay in which the greatest tragedy conceivable to the Germanic mind, kinsman slain by kinsman—son by father—has found classic expression. There, Hiltibrant, the grey-haired warrior, returning from long exile, meets his fiery young son Hadubrant, recognizes, and makes advances to him but is rebuffed and, to save his honor, is compelled to fight and slay him. In the Old Norse poem it is Hildibrand who is slain, by his half brother, Ásmund; and the previous death of Hildibrand’s son at his own hands (stanza 6) is right only as a kind of rudiment. The lay is found, in a much mutilated condition, in the <i>Asmunda saga kappabana</i> (“the Saga of Ásmund, Slayer of Champions”), a <i>fornaldarsaga</i> which must have existed in the twelfth century about as it has come down to us, since it is found in a very similar form in Saxo’s <i>Danish History</i><a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> which was composed toward the end of that century. This version also contains a Latin paraphrase of the lay, in hexameters, agreeing with our fragment down to verbal details; so that a tentative reconstruction of certain lines and stanzas is justifiable.</p>
 
 <p> The saga tells how King Buthli’s daughter, Hild—in the lay and in Saxo she is called Drótt—by the fortunes of war is married successively to two kings. Her sons by these, Hildibrand and Ásmund,<a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#note_2"><font size="1">2</font></a> grow up in ignorance of one another. Both become great warriors. Hildibrand is attached to the Hunnish court, Ásmund becomes the champion of two Saxon lords whose realm has been reduced by Hildibrand. He takes up Hildibrand’s standing challenge to single combat; but as Hildibrand through a description has recognized Ásmund he avoids him and sends his berserkers instead. Only when these have all succumbed does he issue forth himself to the struggle which he knows will be fatal to one or both of them. Wounded unto death, Hildibrand addresses the victor:</p>

 <p><a name="note_8"></a><a href="#fr_8">8</a> The recurrence of “by my head” renders the line suspicious. In Saxo’s verses the dying Hildeglr’s shield is adorned with the figures of the warriors he had slain—among them his own son: “in the middle (panel) stands the picture of my son, drawn with great art, whom this hand of mine snatched out of life.” In the saga, Hildibrand is represented as slaying his son in the berserker rage which overcomes him before going to meet Ásmund.</p>
 
 <p><a name="note_8"></a><a href="#fr_8">8</a> There is nothing in Saxo’s version to suggest a lacuna here.</p>
