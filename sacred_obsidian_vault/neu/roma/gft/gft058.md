 <p>A tree can never be quite dead as long as it puts forth shoots; I fancy the very latest shoot in the whole Yggdrasil of European folk-tales</p>  
 <p><a name="page_lxxxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxi</font></a></p>  
 <p>is the episode in 'The Tinker and his Wife' (<a href="gft130.htm#an_70">No. 70</a>), where the tinker buys a barrel of beer, and says, 'Now, my wench, you make the biggest penny out of it as ever you can,' and she goes and sells the whole barrel to a packman for one of the old big pennies. That episode cannot be earlier than the introduction of the new bronze coinage in 1861; it looks as though it must itself be a recent coinage of Cornelius Price, or of Nebuchanēzar, his uncle. But, there, I have known a Gypsy girl dash off what was almost a folk-tale impromptu. She had been to a pic-nic in a four-in-hand, with 'a lot o’ real tip-top gentry'; and '<i>Reía</i>,' she said to me afterwards, 'I'll tell you the comicalest thing as ever was. We’d pulled up, to put the brake on and there was a <i>púro hotchiwítchi</i> (old hedgehog) come and looked at us through the hedge, looked at me hard. I could see he 'd his eye upon me. And home he'd go, that old hedgehog, to his wife, and "Missus," he'd say, "what d’ ye think? I seen a little Gypsy gal just now in a coach and four bosses"; and "<i>Dábla!</i>" she 'd say, "<i>sawkúmni ’as vardé kenáw</i>"' (Bless us! every one now keeps a carriage).</p>
