 <p>Campbell of Islay has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller in London, and Paspati has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller, the grandson of one at Constantinople. That is not much, perhaps; but there are several more indications of the transmission of folk-tales by Gypsies. <i>Bakht</i>, the Rómani word for 'luck' or 'fortune,' has passed, not merely into Albanian folk-tales, but into the Greek and Turkish languages, as I show in a footnote on <a href="gft072.htm#page_53">p. 53</a>; and a good many of the following seventy-six stories seem to show unmistakable tokens of the practised raconteur's art. 'Let us leave the dogs, and return to the girl,' in <a href="gft107.htm#an_47">No. 47</a>; 'Now we'll leave the master to stand a bit, and go back to the mother,' in <a href="gft128.htm#an_68">No. 68</a>; 'And I came away, told the story,' in Nos. <a href="gft066.htm#an_06">6</a>, <a href="gft067.htm#an_07">7</a>, <a href="gft068.htm#an_08">8</a>, and <a href="gft075.htm#an_15">15</a>; 'And I left them there, and came and told my story to your lordships,' in <a href="gft070.htm#an_10">No. 10</a>; 'I was there, and heard everything that happened,' in <a href="gft072.htm#an_12">No. 12</a>; 'Away I came, the tale have told,' in <a href="gft078.htm#an_18">No. 18</a>; 'Now you've got it,' in <a href="gft088.htm#an_28">No. 28</a>; 'If they are not dead, they are still alive,' in Nos. <a href="gft101.htm#an_41">41</a> and <a href="gft102.htm#an_42">42</a>, and also in Hungarian-Gypsy stories; 'The floor there was made of paper, and I came away here,' in <a href="gft103.htm#an_43">No. 43</a>; 'So if they are not dead, they are living together,' in <a href="gft104.htm#an_44">No. 44</a>; 'Excuse me for saying it,' in <a href="gft115.htm#an_55">No. 55</a>; 'She was delivered (pray, excuse me) of a boy,' in <a href="gft106.htm#an_46">No. 46</a>; 'And the last time I was there I played my harp for them, and got to go again,' in <a href="gft114.htm#an_54">No. 54</a>--these all sound like tags or formulas of the professional story-teller. Léon Zafiri's usual wind-up, says Paspati (p. 421), ran: 'And I too, I was there, and I ate, and I drank, and I have come to tell you the story.'</p>
