 <p>Kurbads, merry Lettland's Wizard,<br>
 With his Magic Incantations,<br>
 Calls the gold and silver to him;<br>
 Calls the jewels and the amber;<br>
 Calls the casks all filled with riches;<br>
 And they lie in heaps before him,<br>
 There they shine and gleam and glitter.</p>
 <p>Then he summons all his Witches,<br>
 Old and wrinkled, toothless, grinning,<br>
 Bids them bide away the Treasures<br>
 In the ruins of the castles,<br>
 Underneath the ancient stone-heaps,<br>
 In the deep and dismal caverns.</p>
 <p>Then he throws a Spell upon them,<br>
 Binds the Treasures with his Magic,<br>
 That no mortal eye may spy them,<br>
 And no mortal Song unloose them.<br>
 Thus he hoards his glittering wonders,<br>
 With his Magic Incantations,<br>
 Kurbads, merry Lettland's Wizard!</p>
