 AMBER COAST</p>
 <p align="CENTER">THE AMBER WIZARD</p><dir>

 <p>See! O see! the Amber Wizard,<br>
 Lithuania's Amber Wizard,<br>
 How he shakes his head all golden,<br>
 Puffs his cheeks as red as apples,<br>
 Steps into the foaming wavelets,<br>
 Dives into the Baltic billows;<br>
 Downward, downward to the forests,<br>
 Ancient pine trees 'neath the waters,<br>
 Pine trees shedding balsam amber,<br>
 Fragrant amber, light as feathers!</p>
 <p>And the Amber Wizard loosens<br>
 Lumps of amber, beads of amber,<br>
 Casts them upwards through the waters,<br>
 Casts them on the sandy seashore;<br>
 For the little ones to gather,<br>
 As they run beside the wavelets.<br>
 Then they rub the balsam amber,<br>
 Yellow amber, nut-brown amber,<br>
 Amber like the drops of honey,<br>
 Crying, "See it glow with shining!"<br>
 Crying, "Feel it tingle gently!"<br>
 Crying, "Smell it, weird and spicy!"<br>
 And the Amber Wizard watches,<br>
 Shakes his head all bright and golden,<br>
 Puffs his checks as red as apples,<br>
 Smiles, and tosses high the amber!</p>
