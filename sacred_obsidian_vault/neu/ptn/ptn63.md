 <p>Once on a time there was a lad who was walking along a road cracking nuts, so he found one that was worm-eaten, and just at that very moment he met the Deil.</p>  
 <p>"Is it true, now," said the lad, "what they say, that the Deil can make himself as small as he chooses, and thrust himself in through a pinhole?"</p>  
 <p>"Yes, it is," said the Deil.</p>  
 <p>"Oh! it is, is it? then let me see you do it, and just creep into this nut," said the lad.</p>  
 <p>So the Deil did it.</p>  
 <p>Now, when he had crept well into it through the worm's hole, the lad stopped it up with a pin.</p>  
 <p>"Now, I've got you safe," he said, and put the nut into his pocket.</p>  
 <p>So when he had walked on a bit, he came to a smithy, and he turned in and asked the smith if he'd be good enough to crack that nut for him.</p>  
 <p>"Ay, that'll be an easy job," said the smith, and took his smallest hammer, laid the nut on the anvil, and gave it a blow, but it wouldn't break.</p>  
 <p>So he took another hammer a little bigger, but that wasn't heavy enough either.</p>  
 <p>Then he took one bigger still, but it was still the same story; and so the smith got wroth, and grasped his great sledge-hammer.</p>  
 <p>"Now, I'll crack you to bits," he said, and let drive at <a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="green">p. 378</font></a> the nut with all his might and main. And so the nut flew to pieces with a bang that blew off half the roof of the smithy, and the whole house creaked and groaned as though it were ready to fall.</p>  
 <p>"Why! if I don't think the Deil must have been in that nut," said the smith.</p>  
 <p>"So he was; you're quite right," said the lad, as he went away laughing.</p>
