 <h1 align="CENTER">The Quest of the Holy Graal</h1>
 <p>THIS is a mysterious part of the adventures of King Arthur's Knights. We must remember that parts of these stories are very old; they were invented by the heathen Welsh, or by the ancient Britons, from whom the Welsh are descended, and by the old pagan Irish, who spoke Gaelic, a language not very unlike Welsh.

But the stories are confused almost like a dream, though it is a beautiful dream.</p>
