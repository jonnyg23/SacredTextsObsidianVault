 <center>CHAPTER LXIV.<br>
 <br>
 <i>Egil's life is given him.</i><br>
 <br>
 </center>King Eric sate upright while Egil recited the poem, and looked keenly at him.  And when the song of praise was ended, then spake the king: 'Right well was the poem recited; and now, Arinbjorn, I have resolved about the cause between me and Egil, how it shall go.  Thou hast pleaded Egil's cause with great eagerness, since thou offerest to risk a conflict with me.  Now shall I for thy sake do what thou hast asked, letting Egil go from my land safe and unhurt.  But thou, Egil, so order thy going that, after leaving my presence and this hall, thou never come before my eyes, nor my sons' eyes, nor be ever in the way of myself or my people.  But I give thee now thy head this time for this reason, that thou camest freely into my power.  I will do no dastardly deed on thee; yet know thou this for sure, that this is no reconciliation with me or my sons or any of our kin who wish to wreak their vengeance.'<br>
 Then sang Egil:<br>
 <br>
                                 'Loth am I in nowise,<br>
                                 Though in features loathly,<br>
                                 Helm-capt head in pardon<br>
                                 From high king to take.<br>
                                 Who can boast that ever<br>
                                 Better gift he won him,<br>
                                 From a lordly sovereign's<br>
                                 Noble-minded son?'<br>
 <br>
         Arinbjorn thanked the king with many fair words for the honour and friendship that he had shown him.  Then they two, Arinbjorn and Egil, went back to Arinbjorn's house.  After that Arinbjorn bade horses be made ready for his people.  He rode away with Egil, and a hundred fully armed men with him.  Arinbjorn rode with that force till they came to king Athelstan, where they were well received.  The king asked Egil to remain with him, and inquired how it had gone between him and king Eric.  Whereupon Egil sang:<br>
 <br>
                                 'Egil his eyes black-browed<br>
                                 From Eric, raven's friend,<br>
                                 Welcomed.  Wise help therein<br>
                                         Wife's loyal kin lent.<br>
                                 My head, throne of helmet,<br>
                                 An heritage noble,<br>
                                 As erst, from rough rainstorm<br>
                                         To rescue I knew.'<br>
 <br>
         But at the parting of Arinbjorn and Egil, Egil gave Arinbjorn those two gold rings that king Athelstan had given him, whereof each weighed a mark.  And Arinbjorn gave Egil the sword called Dragvandill.  This had been given to Arinbjorn by Thorolf Skallagrimsson; but before that Skallagrim had received it from Thorolf his brother; but to Thorolf the sword was given by Grim Shaggy-skin, son of Kettle Hæing.  Kettle Hæing had owned the sword and used it in his single combats, and no sword was there more biting.  Egil and Arinbjorn parted with much affection.  Arinbjorn went home to king Eric at York; but Egil's comrades and shipmates had good peace there, and disposed of their cargo under Arinbjorn's protection.  But as winter wore on they moved south to England and joined Egil.<br>
