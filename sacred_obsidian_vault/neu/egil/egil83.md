 <center>CHAPTER LXXXII.<br>
 <br>
 <i>Hacon's wars and death.  Poem on Arinbjorn.<br>
 <br>
 </i></center>Long time did Egil dwell at Borg, and became an old man.  But it is not told that he had lawsuits with any here in the land; nor is there a word of single combats, or war and slaughter of his after he settled down here in Iceland.  They say that Egil never went abroad out of Iceland after the events already related.  And for this the main cause was that Egil might not be in Norway, by reason of the charges which (as has been told before) the kings there deemed they had against him.  He kept house in munificent style, for there was no lack of money, and his disposition led him to munificence.<br>
 King Hacon, Athelstan's foster-son, long ruled over Norway; but in the latter part of his life Eric's sons came to Norway and strove with him for the kingdom; and they had battles together, wherein Hacon ever won the victory.  The last battle was fought in Hordaland, on Stord-island, at Fitjar: there king Hacon won the victory, but also got his death-wound.  After that Egil's sons took the kingdom in Norway.  <br>
 Lord Arinbjorn was with Harold Eric's son, and was made his counsellor, and had of him great honours.  He was commander of his forces and defender of the land.  A great warrior was Arinbjorn, and a victorious.  He was governor of the Firth folk.  Egil Skallagrimsson heard these tidings of the change of kings in Norway, and therewith how Arinbjorn had returned to his estates in Norway, and was there in great honour.  Then Egil composed a poem about Arinbjorn, whereof this is the beginning:<br>

                                                 1.<br>
                                 'For generous prince<br>
                                 Swift praise I find,<br>
                                 But stint my words<br>
                                 To stingy churl.<br>
                                 Openly sing I<br>
                                 Of king's true deeds,<br>
                                 But silence keep<br>
                                 On slander's lies.<br>
 <br>
                                                 2.<br>
                                 'For fabling braggarts<br>
                                 Full am I of scorn,<br>
                                 But willing speak I<br>
                                 Of worthy friends:<br>
                                 Courts I of monarchs<br>
                                 A many have sought,<br>
                                 A gallant minstrel<br>
                                 Of guileless mood.<br>
 <br>
                                                 3.<br>
                                 'Erewhile the anger<br>
                                 Of Yngling's son<br>
                                 I bore, prince royal<br>
                                 Of race divine.<br>
                                 With hood of daring<br>
                                 O'er dark locks drawn<br>
                                 A lord right noble<br>
                                 I rode to seek.<br>
 <br>
                                                 4.<br>
                                 'There sate in might<br>
 The monarch strong,<br>
 With helm of terror<br>
 High-throned and dread;<br>
 A king unbending<br>
 With bloody blade<br>
 Within York city<br>
 Wielded he power.<br>
 <br>
                                                 5.<br>
                                 'That moon-like brightness<br>
 Might none behold,<br>
 Nor brook undaunted<br>
 Great Eric's brow:<br>
 As fiery serpent<br>
 His flashing eyes<br>
 Shot starry radiance<br>
 Stern and keen.<br>
 <br>
                                                 6.<br>
                                 'Yet I to this ruler<br>
 Of fishful seas<br>
 My bolster-mate's ransom<br>
 Made bold to bear,<br>
 Of Odin's goblet<br>
 O'erflowing dew<br>
 Each listening ear-mouth<br>
 Eagerly drank.<br>
 <br>
                                                 7.<br>
                                 'Not beauteous in seeming<br>
 My bardic fee<br>
 To ranks of heroes<br>
 In royal hall:<br>
 When I my hood-knoll<br>
 Wolf-gray of hue<br>
 For mead of Odin<br>
 From monarch gat.<br>
 <br>
                                                 8.<br>
                                 'Thankful I took it,<br>
 And therewithal<br>
 The pit-holes black<br>
 Of my beetling brows;<br>
 Yea and that mouth<br>
 That for me bare<br>
 The poem of praise<br>
 To princely knees.<br>
 <br>
                                                 9.<br>
                                 'Tooth-fence took I,<br>
 And tongue likewise,<br>
 Ears' sounding chambers<br>
 And sheltering eaves.<br>
 And better deemed I<br>
 Than brightest gold<br>
 The gift then given<br>
 By glorious king.<br>
 <br>
                                                 10.<br>
                                 'There a staunch stay<br>
 Stood by my side,<br>
 One man worth many<br>
 Of meaner wights,<br>
 Mine own true friend<br>
 Whom trusty I found,<br>
 High-couraged ever<br>
 In counsels bold.<br>
 <br>
                                                 11.<br>
                                 'Arinbjorn<br>
 Alone us saved—<br>
 Foremost of champions—<br>
 From fury of king;<br>
 Friend of the monarch<br>
 He framed no lies<br>
 Within that palace<br>
 Of warlike prince.<br>
 <br>
                                                 12.<br>
                                 'Of the stay of our house<br>
 Still spake he truth,<br>
 (While much he honoured<br>
 My hero-deeds)<br>
 Of the son of Kveldulf,<br>
 Whom fair-haired king<br>
 Slew for a slander,<br>
 But honoured slain.<br>
 <br>
                                                 13.<br>
                                 'Wrong were it if he<br>
                                 Who wrought me good,<br>
                                 Gold-splender lavish,<br>
                                 Such gifts had cast<br>
                                 To the wasteful tract<br>
                                 Of the wild sea-mew,<br>
                                 To the surge rough-ridden<br>
                                 By sea-kings' steeds.<br>
 <br>
                                                 14.<br>
                                 'False to my friend<br>
 Were I fairly called,<br>
 An untrue steward<br>
 Of Odin's cup;<br>
 Of praise unworthy,<br>
 Pledge-breaker vile,<br>
 If I for such good<br>
 Gave nought again.<br>

                                                 15.<br>
                                 'Now better seeth<br>
 The bard to climb<br>
 With feet poetic<br>
 The frowning steep,<br>
 And set forth open<br>
 In sight of all<br>
 The laud and honour<br>
 Of high-born chief.<br>

                                 'Now shall my voice-plane<br>
 Shape into song<br>
 Virtues full many<br>
 Of valiant friend.<br>
 Ready on tongue<br>
 Twofold they lie,<br>
 Yea, threefold praises<br>
 Of Thorir's son.<br>

                                 'First tell I forth<br>
 What far is known,<br>
 Openly bruited<br>
 In ears of all;<br>
 How generous of mood<br>
 Men deem this lord,<br>
 Bjorn of the hearth-fire<br>
 The birchwood's bane.<br>

                                 'Folk bear witness<br>
 With wond'ring praise,<br>
 How to all guests<br>

 For Bjorn of the hearth-stone<br>
 Is blest with store<br>
 Freely and fully<br>

                                 'Out of the mansion<br>
 Of Arinbjorn,<br>

 In generous wise,<br>

 'Early waked I,<br>
 Word I gathered,<br>
 Toiled each morning<br>
 With speech-moulding tongue.<br>
 A proud pile built I<br>
 Of praise long-lasting<br>
 To stand unbroken<br>
 In Bragi's town.'<br>
