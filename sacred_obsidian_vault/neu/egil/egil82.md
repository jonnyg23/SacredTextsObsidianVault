 <i>Death of Bodvar: Egil's poem thereon.<br>
 <br>
 </i></center>Bodvar Egil's son was just now growing up; he was a youth of great promise, handsome, tall and strong as had been Egil or Thorolf at his age.  Egil loved him dearly, and Bodvar was very fond of his father.  One summer it happened that there was a ship in White-river, and a great fair was held there.  Egil had there bought much wood, which he was having conveyed home by water: for this his house-carles went, taking with them an eight-oared boat belonging to Egil.  It chanced one time that Bodvar begged to go with them, and they allowed him so to do.  So he went into the field with the house-carles.  They were six in all on the eight-oared boat.  And when they had to go out again, high-water was late in the day, and, as they must needs wait for the turn of tide, they did not start till late in the evening.  Then came on a violent south-west gale, against which ran the stream of the ebb.  This made a rough sea in the firth, as can often happen.  The end was that the boat sank under them, and all were lost.  The next day the bodies were cast up: Bodvar's body came on shore at Einars-ness, but some came in on the south shore of the firth, whither also the boat was driven, being found far in near Reykjarhamar.<br>
 Egil heard these tidings that same day, and at once rode to seek the bodies: he found Bodvar's, took it up and set it on his knees, and rode with it out to Digra-ness, to Skallagrim's mound.  Then he had the mound opened, and laid Bodvar down there by Skallagrim.  After which the mound was closed again; this task was not finished till about nightfall.  Egil then rode home to Borg, and, when he came home, he went at once to the locked bed-closet in which he was wont to sleep.  He lay down, and shut himself in, none daring to crave speech of him.<br>
 It is said that when they laid Bodvar in earth Egil was thus dressed: his hose were tight-fitting to his legs, he wore a red kirtle of fustian, closely-fitting, and laced at the sides: but they say that his muscles so swelled with his exertion that the kirtle was rent off him, as were also the hose.<br>
 On the next day Egil still did not open the bed-closet: he had no meat or drink: there he lay for that day and the following night, no man daring to speak with him.  But on the third morning, as soon as it was light, Asgerdr had a man set on horseback, who rode as hard as he could westwards to Hjardarholt, and told Thorgerdr all these tidings; it was about nones when he got there.  He said also that Asgerdr had sent her word to come without delay southwards to Borg.  Thorgerdr at once bade them saddle her a horse, and two men attended her.  They rode that evening and through the night till they came to Borg.  Thorgerdr went at once into the hall.  Asgerdr greeted her, and asked whether they had eaten supper.  Thorgerdr said aloud, 'No supper have I had, and none will I have till I sup with Freyja.  I can do no better than does my father: I will not overlive my father and brother.'  She then went to the bed-closet and called, 'Father, open the door!  I will that we both travel the same road.'  Egil undid the lock.  Thorgerdr stepped up into the bed-closet, and locked the door again, and lay down on another bed that was there.<br>
 Then said Egil, 'You do well, daughter, in that you will follow your father.  Great love have you shown to me.  What hope is there that I shall wish to live with this grief?'  After this they were silent awhile.  Then Egil spoke: 'What is it now, daughter?  You are chewing something, are you not?'  'I am chewing samphire,' said she, 'because I think it will do me harm.  Otherwise I think I may live too long.'  'Is samphire bad for man?' said Egil.  'Very bad,' said she; 'will you eat some?'  'Why should I not?' said he.  A little while after she called and bade them give her drink.  Water was brought to her.  Then said Egil, 'This comes of eating samphire, one ever thirsts the more.'  'Would you like a drink, father?' said she.  He took and swallowed the liquid in a deep draught: it was in a horn.  Then said Thorgerdr: 'Now are we deceived; this is milk.'  Whereat Egil bit a sherd out of the horn, all that his teeth gripped, and cast the horn down.<br>
 Then spoke Thorgerdr: 'What counsel shall we take now?  This our purpose is defeated.  Now I would fain, father, that we should lengthen our lives, so that you may compose a funeral poem on Bodvar, and I will grave it on a wooden roller; after that we can die, if we like.  Hardly, I think, can Thorstein your son compose a poem on Bodvar; but it were unseemly that he should not have funeral rites.  Though I do not think that we two shall sit at the drinking when the funeral feast is held.'  Egil said that it was not to be expected that he could now compose, though he were to attempt it.  'However, I will try this,' said he.<br>
 Egil had had another son named Gunnar, who had died a short time before.<br>
 So then Egil began the poem, and this is the beginning.<br>

 <br>
         Egil began to cheer up as the composing of the poem went on; and when the poem was complete, he brought it before Asgerdr and Thorgerdr and his family.  He rose from his bed, and took his place in the high-seat.  This poem he called 'Loss of Sons.'  And now Egil had the funeral feast of his son held after ancient custom.  But when Thorgerdr went home, Egil enriched her with good gifts.<br>
